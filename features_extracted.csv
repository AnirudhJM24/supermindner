321751,if you account every single nft available to buy the target goes to 24k eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
321756,balancer shimmer supply of333 cost 333 eth sure friend,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
321837,8k in eth withdrawal should be noticeable even if split across a few wallets,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
321839,reasonably safe if done correctly if you are impatient or pull out as much as you put in its obvioustheres some deniability which is nice but its nothing like privacy first tech aztec secret etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
321842,on which testnet can i get like a thousand eth easy,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
321848,in case of an investigation by the irs i am just hypothesizing and condone anyone who does this and i am not even sure this method would work dont do this no sarcasm1 you supposedly anonymously create a shitcoin call it time and buy it from your actual clean wallet worth 10k usd only at the start2 you proceed buy it then from the dirty wallets create volumes make a community do bribes etc that all creates legitimacy around the coin3 along the way people buy and sell so you might be buying someone elses bags and as such you should consider it as an expense like 10 for washing and ofc you can stop buying at any pointthis is much harder to do than you think you need more legitimacy around the project but this is the tldr option you might end up losing too much in this case but this is one of the options in the growing market you can even make more this way than the notional you had,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
321869,total now is around 150k eth so prob around 5,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
321875,500 unique users per week46k eth withdrawals per month 115 per weekso withdrawals above 45 eth 2x avg per week might trigger some pointers i presume,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', '500', 'unique', 'users', 'week46k', 'eth', 'withdrawals', 'month', '115', 'weekso', 'withdrawals', '45', 'eth', '2x', 'avg', 'week', 'trigger', 'pointers', 'presume']"

321901,yes i tried to deposit funds from the sale of an ape i minted into a crypto native bank and they rejected it citing a lack of kyc on opensea now imagine showing them a project where you are the only one profiting maybe a bank less familiar with crypto wouldnt think about these things who knows,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
321935,hey guys i am having an open discussion with adtiya from derivadex right now on zoom feel free to hop on if interested about derivatives and hardware innovations in defi,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
321939,hardware in defi,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
321959,also feel free to join we are in the process of setting up a juicebox to donate eth in exchange for the justice token which will govern the dao and be eligible for fractionaliztion for the jullian assange x pak nft collaboration all proceeds raised will be used to fund legal fees for julian assange in his us extradition case,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322002,in 20 min at the top of the hour scbuergel is going take a break from shitposting in lobster chat to come talk about metadata collection and leakage in defi weve collected all of your ips paired them to your eth addresses and are forwarding them to the irs if you dont come and join,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', '20', 'min', 'hour', 'scbuergel', 'going', 'break', 'shitposting', 'lobster', 'chat', 'come', 'talk', 'metadata', 'collection', 'leakage', 'defi', 've', 'collected', 'ips', 'paired', 'eth', 'addresses', 'forwarding', 'irs', 'nt', 'come', 'join']"
322020,yeah seems like theres an nft sale so lots of people are paying 12 eth in tips for priority,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322046,youtube defi rug anything finance youtube run redacted the message but if you wanna learn the basics finematics and whiteboard crypto make decent videos wo inherent shilling,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322117,dumb question but how would i figure out what types of collateral have been liquidated during a market downturn for example were most liquidated loans backed by eth or some other asset or a basket of assets on makercompoundaave,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322118,is there a dune dash for this,"['dash', 'dash']"
322123,i ask because im wondering if there is a way to build a portfolio of assets to borrow against that is resistant to huge market downturns in eth and btc but also still has some upside,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322144,yeah the guy who uses every single popular defi drama for his own self promotion is not trying to be opportunistic here once again he just cares for the poor frogs,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322169,never been part of any defi dramas not to mention profited this particular situation matters to me a lot because practices of the frog nation go against everything i believe in honesty,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322178,i agree 6 months from now a new wonderland will pop up and another bunch of crypto newcomers will get rekt for good and never come back we can do better than just leave it,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
322194,whos we im not involved with any of their projects are you if not maybe step back and let them solve or do whatever they want sjw in defi is not needed anyway this is not the chat for such things many can argue against governance and many for one opinion is no better than the other,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322197,defi wont ever evolve from the wildwildwest with this mentality itll stay a fun casino and thats it,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322212,defi is not a single organism and we do not control it or need to direct it into the right direction devs build users invest into whatever they want freedom,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322213,this is probably the most underrated aspect of defi,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322238,part of the efficiency is in saving in storage spaceeg right now an eth transaction means youre storing the full call params of what youre doing on chain thats how you prove that youre really sending those tokenswith zk proofs in theory you can just store a proof that those tokens were transfered without ever having the need to store the transaction details themselves,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322256,fwiw im glad we have at least l1 project eth thats more idealistic than the rest which are justifiably cutting some corners,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322262,all l1s are cutting corners except eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322302,hi sorry i meant whether it was new to fantom as i dont remember them having this scaling direction would love to see more details also great to see more blockchains exploring horizontal scaling vs the vertical l2 scaling on eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322390,just wormhole eth exploited,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322404,or whatever the synthetic wormhole eth deriv is called,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322405,soeth is sollet eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322408,wat how is soeth related to wormhole eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322409,if anything it pumps because people dump wormhole eth for soeth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322412,wormhole eth soeth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322414,whats the ticker for wormhole eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322415,im guessing nobody in solana rn wants to be holding any synth eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322418,wormhole eth on solana is just eth lol,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'wormhole', 'eth', 'solana', 'eth', 'lol']"
322419,ticker is eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322423,anyways you want to borrow wormhole eth and sell it,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322433,wait this was exploited for real eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322438,yes the backing of wormhole eth has been wiped out,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322440,the hacker receive initial eth from tornado,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322441,if wormhole eth falls there might be a play to buy it hoping alameda drops their lunch money to cover hackif it doesnt fall the play is to borrow it on solend and sell it hoping to pay back loan cheaper,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322445,what could be the effects on solana defi i imagine,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322448,there seems to be quite some time between contract deployment and funding from tornado and the actual drainage so a tool we spoke of before could have detected this but my issue is what would be the playbook you cant stop contracts every time such shit happens what if somebody is just messing with you so how would you even pause or unpause given you dont even know if there is an issue and if yes what it is bantegnvm this was an eoa on eth side,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322449,solend mkt rn wormhole eth at the top correct,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322450,probably wrapped eth on other chains backed by eth on eth are exploited trying to figure out the exploit rn looks bad tho,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'probably', 'wrapped', 'eth', 'chains', 'backed', 'eth', 'eth', 'exploited', 'trying', 'figure', 'exploit', 'rn', 'looks', 'bad', 'tho']"
322454,i am noob does this effectively mean double spend for all that wrapped eth if protocols dont react in time,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322483,solend borrow limit on eth is capped and not allowing borrows now,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322487,wormhole eth ftx withdrawals still working,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322527,whereas on eth contracts are written in solidity on solana you write them in another language and compile them to bytecode,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322528,well i know theyre rust wasm but i never explored further i kind of assumed that the eth model of verifying contracts via etherscan or similar would still stand,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322540,he couldve bought a binance kyc for 30 in telegram groups tho,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
322585,btw isnt an issue of this hack also that the attacker coud drain all wormhole eth paired trading pairs across the solana protocols if i understand correctly the vulnerability is based on being able to mint the wormhole eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'btw', 'nt', 'issue', 'hack', 'attacker', 'coud', 'drain', 'wormhole', 'eth', 'paired', 'trading', 'pairs', 'solana', 'protocols', 'understand', 'correctly', 'vulnerability', 'based', 'able', 'mint', 'wormhole', 'eth']"
322620,rekt,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
322626,eth will be added over the next hours to ensure weth is backed 11,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322627,damn someone can just pull 120k eth outta their wallets in an hour,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322672,i think the problem is the entire eth scaling model everything needs to be bridged long term this will have more security issues like this one,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322684,note that solana is not part of the eth scaling model it is an l1 trying to be relevant by bridging assets ultimately homed on eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'note', 'solana', 'eth', 'scaling', 'model', 'l1', 'trying', 'relevant', 'bridging', 'assets', 'ultimately', 'homed', 'eth']"
322685,it doesnt derive any of its security from eth but it depends on it,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322686,im not saying that eth l2s wont experience similar pains but at least those wont have the centralization risks that youre taking on to ease one of the other trilemma legs,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322722,does a normal lending protoool even have liquidityim just trying to figure out why do this instead of the old boring stuff borrow against eth directly,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322732,i wonder how eth originates since its unclear from the diagram depending on how exactly this works they could have etheth 9010 in the amm which sounds dangerously close to reserve banking tbh,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322747,it hopefully will can share my experience building out router protocol as some of you in the group know the issue is as a builder you have to proceed very very cautiously even if you have what you think is a cool product and there is a huge latent demand you continuously want to get one more audit one more pen testing process done before opening up out of alpha and letting loose and the likes of samczsun tob etc the platinum names are all booked for the foreseeable future by big wellfunded projects and the large funds and have zero bandwidth to look at the small guys like us who think we might have a slightly differentiated approach in the meantime the investors and the community want the product updates immediately like yesterday also on the matter of audits the current big vendor model is completely flawed in terms of incentive alignment even the largest names and we have worked with almost all of them are basically maximising billing and have no real skin in the game the most critical bugs for router have been discovered by independent white hat hackers or by daos like immunifi and these are also struggling for talent to service demand,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
322754,not any real defi protocol,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322804,how do you go about bridging to native network token for fees without using an exchange for eg i have 1 eth on eth network and want to bridge it to ftm network in ftm but my ftm wallet side is new and has no ftm for feesi am mostly using anyswap stable pools but you still need to use exchange their to get some native token for fees yesthanks,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'bridging', 'native', 'network', 'token', 'fees', 'exchange', 'eg', '1', 'eth', 'eth', 'network', 'want', 'bridge', 'ftm', 'network', 'ftm', 'ftm', 'wallet', 'new', 'ftm', 'feesi', 'anyswap', 'stable', 'pools', 'need', 'use', 'exchange', 'native', 'token', 'fees', 'yesthanks']"
322805,some bridges add a bit of native token for gas some times there are faucets sometimes you would have to buy ftm on eth mainnet and bridge that first,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322812,i meant for example if i want to go from polygon to avax theres only option to do so via usdc pool and not native tokens itll get stuck and has no point if my avax wallet is new and has no avax for fees to withdraw usdc from pool on the other end,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'meant', 'example', 'want', 'polygon', 'avax', 's', 'option', 'usdc', 'pool', 'native', 'tokens', 'll', 'stuck', 'point', 'avax', 'wallet', 'new', 'avax', 'fees', 'withdraw', 'usdc', 'pool', 'end']"
322813,yeah this is one of the biggest issues for people trying to start a fresh wallet on other chains without a cex you have very limited possibilities of getting enough of the native token to get started you may be able to bridge 100k usdc but then can not use it because you cant pay for gas,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
322825,hmm so they panicked and secured funding from investors the 120k eth are still in the attackers wallet will be interesting to see their technical writeup,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322830,because it would have rekt tf out of solana,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
322831,pyth wormhole etc are all jump,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
322856,yea this is definitely the case they only started their crypto division in 2017 so plenty of capital to bail out their subsidiary now all eyes on that wallet to see where the eth moves,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322863,so another dumb questionjump is backing the 300m hack of the wormwhole with ethwhere did they buy those eth and did anyone already found the tx of jump buying these eths,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322865,its jump probably had 300m eth sitting around,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322874,sorry for my ignorance guys but what is the best place to get some ust on ethereum looking for busd and usdc ust so i can send it over terra bridge,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
322901,not sure what you wanna read really id say the topic is quite simple 1 you mean managing usdc inside your treasury it will always be directional unless you just farm in compoundaaveyearn safe old pools which is low risk and decentralized as much as it can be and if it is instead directional even if delta neutral strategies and you have to do it offchain via some mm or at risk of liquidations you are then taking a subjective risk and causing potential issues to the longevity of the treasury you pretty much get your own sifu lmao2 if you mean token side well you cant do much with it but beg lending protocols to accept it as collateral you can diversify treasury into usdc but dont go too fanatic or you might sell too much too early what is the balance also subjective,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'sure', 'wanna', 'read', 'd', 'topic', 'simple', '1', 'mean', 'managing', 'usdc', 'inside', 'treasury', 'directional', 'farm', 'compoundaaveyearn', 'safe', 'old', 'pools', 'low', 'risk', 'decentralized', 'instead', 'directional', 'delta', 'neutral', 'strategies', 'offchain', 'mm', 'risk', 'liquidations', 'taking', 'subjective', 'risk', 'causing', 'potential', 'issues', 'longevity', 'treasury', 'pretty', 'sifu', 'lmao2', 'mean', 'token', 'nt', 'beg', 'lending', 'protocols', 'accept', 'collateral', 'diversify', 'treasury', 'usdc', 'nt', 'fanatic', 'sell', 'early', 'balance', 'subjective']"
322905,i think maybe it is a bit simpler than that basically i started a multisig for a dao we fundraised from the community a bit and now realizing like if we make revenue do i allocate it out to investors in the multisig if someone invests more than someone else do they have like more ownership what if someone leaves the dao and has invested in the multisig etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
322908,it depends on the arrangements made so far what you promised etc if you are calling it a dao i assume it should all be proportional,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
322910,right now we have done 05 eth contributions without being able to invest more so havent cross that bridge yet,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
322916,at some point defi has to intersect with tradfi,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322928,i feel like the us is wielding its power over defi in the worst possible way banks have to comply to fatca yet here we have a decentralized protocol that isnt subject to any legislation that must now comply with us issued regulations and for what reason exactly what penalty of noncompliance is the us going to block defi by sanction i wonder if the us govt needs to grant itself a research program to research the feasibility of such nonsense in the first place instead of demanding that everyone comply to their demands which are based in its pipe dream of wanting total taxation of its citizens no matter where they live,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'feel', 'like', 'wielding', 'power', 'defi', 'worst', 'possible', 'way', 'banks', 'comply', 'fatca', 'decentralized', 'protocol', 'nt', 'subject', 'legislation', 'comply', 'issued', 'regulations', 'reason', 'exactly', 'penalty', 'noncompliance', 'going', 'block', 'defi', 'sanction', 'wonder', 'govt', 'needs', 'grant', 'research', 'program', 'research', 'feasibility', 'nonsense', 'place', 'instead', 'demanding', 'comply', 'demands', 'based', 'pipe', 'dream', 'wanting', 'total', 'taxation', 'citizens', 'matter', 'live']"
322929,could some clever person please explain me whats wrong with lusd seems liquity cant implement any kyc,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
322948,well at the latest fixed income leaders summit defi was a key topic of discussion,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322951,i totally agree eventually defi is going to come to a fork either its completely sovereign from meat space and cannot be governed by nation states or nation states are going to figure out how to impose their will and everyones gonna have to figure out how to cope with thatwe still dont know which way things are going to end up so its important to build an understanding of how we would have to cope if things take a turn towards the worst,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322953,well we know how the last time 33 turned out this time its not for number goes up but for the spine of defi,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322958,fixed income leaders are already strategising and planning how to integrate defi,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322965,defi has always been an alternative an escape route if you wish we can only make sure its universally loved so it cant be easily attacked,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322971,not quoting anything legalese just think the choke point is the onoff ramp for fiat for a company or more so can a defi project like aave level exist without needing an off ramp,"['conventional government-issued currency (e.g. us dollar, euro)', 'fiat', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'quoting', 'legalese', 'think', 'choke', 'point', 'onoff', 'ramp', 'fiat', 'company', 'defi', 'project', 'like', 'aave', 'level', 'exist', 'needing', 'ramp']"
322985,is this really where defi is headed i had such admiration for dai,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
322994,all the current defi dapps will eventually split into two parallel markets cedefi vs defi regulatory pressures will become a litmus paper guess we might get quite surprised as to who ends up in which team,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'current', 'defi', 'dapps', 'eventually', 'split', 'parallel', 'markets', 'cedefi', 'vs', 'defi', 'regulatory', 'pressures', 'litmus', 'paper', 'guess', 'surprised', 'ends', 'team']"
322998,srsly whats the point of defi if its not pushing boundaries the whole reason behind the decentralized aspect of it is so that it can,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
323002,i dont really get how those statements reconcile with the selection of aml tools for makerdao with a demo conducted for the community to review from the forum post,"['anti-money laundering', 'aml']"
323004,still not sure if this whole thing makes sense but if the intention is indeed to not use them but just study aml tools i guess we are still not at danger territory but yeah not sure why they would even do this kind of research if there was not an intention to actually do amlkyc at some point feel a bit like gaslighting,"['anti-money laundering', 'aml']"
323007,here is what will likely be the end result of makerdaos research on complianceaccording to fatf recommendation jurisdictions should recognize main developers or founders or operators as those that control influence activities within a dapp recommend that they get identified as virtual asset service providers vasps which means imposing aml compliance on themthe fatf advises a riskbased approach to deal with unhosted wallets with compliant vasps either limiting transactions and their volumes or entirely banning interactions blockchain analysis software programs are however important tools for assistance in the case that vasps do not intend to apply an outright bancompliance officer will suggest the implementation of a travel rule solution like notabene or some other vasps can use the notabene solution to embed proofofnoncustodialwallet ownership into their product discover send and receive fully compliant blockchain transactions to any vasp through their vasp directory and proprietary multiprotocol switch set riskbased rules in the rules engine to automate compliance at scale manage travel rule data transfers from their compliance platformalso implementation of amlcft complianceanalysis tool with blacklisting capabilities realtime protection against malicious actors and ability to block suspicious users and funds from transacting,"['anti-money laundering', 'aml']"
323013,isnt the goal of defi to bring in as much capital as possibleif institutions banks etc require amlkyc cant we have bothcant have a permissionless path for whom ever doesnt want compliance this is ethereum right its decentralized and permissionless at its core but dapps can opt as they already do to provide a compliant pathmore money in circulation better for everyone and the future of defi,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'ethereum classic', 'etc', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'nt', 'goal', 'defi', 'bring', 'capital', 'possibleif', 'institutions', 'banks', 'etc', 'require', 'amlkyc', 'nt', 'bothcant', 'permissionless', 'path', 'nt', 'want', 'compliance', 'ethereum', 'right', 'decentralized', 'permissionless', 'core', 'dapps', 'opt', 'provide', 'compliant', 'pathmore', 'money', 'circulation', 'better', 'future', 'defi']"
323017,in a scenario where there did end up being two sets of liquidity where kyc liq on one side and defi liq on the other wouldnt defi slowly gain dominance on a long enough time scalei ask this because of the race to the bottom we see in regards to feerent extraction from protocols where they only end up being able to capture the value they add and kyc would have added costs that would put them at a disadvantagei wonder if there were a partypool that was able to exist in both the kyc side and the defi side would they end up migrating to defi as it is essentially defecting on those who stay in the kyc realmi hope this makes sense,"['know your customer', 'kyc', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'know your customer', 'kyc', 'know your customer', 'kyc', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'know your customer', 'kyc', 'scenario', 'end', 'sets', 'liquidity', 'kyc', 'liq', 'defi', 'liq', 'nt', 'defi', 'slowly', 'gain', 'dominance', 'long', 'time', 'scalei', 'ask', 'race', 'regards', 'feerent', 'extraction', 'protocols', 'end', 'able', 'capture', 'value', 'add', 'kyc', 'added', 'costs', 'disadvantagei', 'wonder', 'partypool', 'able', 'exist', 'kyc', 'defi', 'end', 'migrating', 'defi', 'essentially', 'defecting', 'stay', 'kyc', 'realmi', 'hope', 'makes', 'sense']"
323018,if you are making a kyc pool like aave and as an institutional party you subjectively believe you cant touch other defi money cause of ur vague understanding of aml you cant go to the dex really then anymore so you pay more in the kyc pool however you will probably have semikyc parties and mms who will arb the two and make their money,"['know your customer', 'kyc', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'anti-money laundering', 'aml', 'know your customer', 'kyc', 'making', 'kyc', 'pool', 'like', 'aave', 'institutional', 'party', 'subjectively', 'believe', 'nt', 'touch', 'defi', 'money', 'cause', 'ur', 'vague', 'understanding', 'aml', 'nt', 'dex', 'anymore', 'pay', 'kyc', 'pool', 'probably', 'semikyc', 'parties', 'mms', 'arb', 'money']"
323020,arbs themselves depend on how regulations develop govs might not be able to shut pure defi or even make a ground to imprison foundersteams cos the protocol is decentralized but they can very well ensure that fiat offramps cant accept crypto deposits from any address that has interacted with pure defi or tornado that itself will prevent any legit mm from participating in the system,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'conventional government-issued currency (e.g. us dollar, euro)', 'fiat', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'arbs', 'depend', 'regulations', 'develop', 'govs', 'able', 'shut', 'pure', 'defi', 'ground', 'imprison', 'foundersteams', 'cos', 'protocol', 'decentralized', 'ensure', 'fiat', 'offramps', 'nt', 'accept', 'crypto', 'deposits', 'address', 'interacted', 'pure', 'defi', 'tornado', 'prevent', 'legit', 'mm', 'participating', 'system']"
323026,there is evidence aml does not work at all more spent than protected and it only takes rights away from people and all the accreditation stuff is total horseshit you also infringe on privacy and if you say why need privacy if you are not doing something illegal this is a dead end but we dont have to argue ethics on law stance in lobsters it makes for useless conversations,"['anti-money laundering', 'aml']"
323027,less opinions more alpha please we dont need to debate the basics of human interactions here cause it would flood bring eth merge news,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
323029,kyced defi will actually make implementation challenges listed there easier better tracking lower compliance costs global cooardination on a shared ledger,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
323030,in b4 kycd defi leads to enforcing accreditation bullshit preventing anyone from actually doing anythingedit im not prokyc at all,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

324224,as a founder of data indexing project i completely agree with this we pay huge infrastructure fees its quite difficult to directly access nodes data in real time as it needs more processing to make it granular hence you have to keep the data in centralized dbs which increases the cost as well as makes it more centralized if we try to decentralize it by having more people to host these centralized dbs and having validation on top of it the cost increases significantly but having said all this asking each dapp to develop their own indexers is too much of an ask it takes a quite a bit of learning curver to understand the internals of blockchain to implement a proper indexer and an army to maintain it especially if youre indexing a chain like bsc and solana kudos to graph that they took the subgraph approach but there is necessity of data even for people who are not smart contract developers thats where these balancers transactions etc will help and also subgraph requires people to write code even for trivial requirements unmarshal is currently testing a no code auto indexing tool for smart contracts with built in support for price token details notifications analytics and apis hopefully it solves many issues discussed here,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

326806,just wanted to clarify a few things when comparing railgun and tornado nova1 merkle deposit proof with utxo model has been in literature long before tornado cash existed you could check zerocash paper for reference so it isnt as if tornado cash has pioneered it or receives credit for the joinsplit circuit design2 using bridges by tornado nova will never give the same security as relying on l1 there is an article by vitalik talking about all the issues with crosschains and bridges 3 unlike tornado nova railgun allows users to interact privately with defi smart contracts from within the railgun pool through adapters so it is a more mature protocol than just a private transfer4 railgun has the ability to whitelist vet erc20 if needed by a governance proposal so it isnt a limitation5 the tech of railgun is still evolving to support nft private transfer private vesting proofs of disclosure sealedbid auctions some of these features are already in audit so railgun isnt a copypaste of tornado novaim open to discussingelaborating more on an honest comparison,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

326984,this fud is unfair to both polygon and us the reality is that the vulnerability is nearly impossible to exploit as there are layers of complexity that make it easy to block the attack lets explore them though all of them are in the bugfix review already the attack is not currently possible because there is no open validator when a validator opens up there will be a fierce flashbots auction this auction needs to be won on every iteration of the attack and the attack must be iterated the attack fails if any auction is lost which it will be if the polygon community notices the attacker wont get their eth back if the attack fails its extremely costly to attempt the attack the attacker also needs large amounts of delegated matic theres currently 4b total of matic staked 5b at the time of the report to attempt the attack the attacker needs 16b of matic for a 2checkpoint more than 5 hours attack which is the minimum amount of time completely unfeasible as theres only 55m of matic available in dexes across ethereum and polygon a more modest 10m of matic takes 398 checkpoints more than 47 days even 100m of matic takes more than 4 days if at any point before the conclusion of the attack the polygon security team takes action be it the minimum 5 hours with 16b of matic or the 47 days with 10m of matic the attack completely failsgiven the significant nonrecoverable eth for flashbots unrealistically large matic requirements and the overwhelming probability of a successful whitehat counterresponse the report was downgraded from critical to high by the polygon team because it was not feasible to exploit in practice we reviewed this case with them in detail to validate that judgment and concluded it was fair and reasonable we always require a detailed explanation and reasoning why severity needs to be downgraded as our imperative is to ensure whitehats are treated fairly none of that is to say it wasnt an excellent report the vulnerability is very creative the report is well written and the whitehat is an exceptional goodfaith actorso this fud from eylon across multiple chats is it ignorance of the impossibility of exploitation or is it disingenuous i couldnt help but notice that eylon is invested in our competitor,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'fud', 'unfair', 'polygon', 'reality', 'vulnerability', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'exploit', 'layers', 'complexity', 'easy', 'block', 'attack', 'lets', 'explore', 'bugfix', 'review', 'attack', 'currently', 'possible', 'open', 'validator', 'validator', 'opens', 'fierce', 'flashbots', 'auction', 'auction', 'needs', 'won', 'iteration', 'attack', 'attack', 'iterated', 'attack', 'fails', 'auction', 'lost', 'polygon', 'community', 'notices', 'attacker', 'wo', 'nt', 'eth', 'attack', 'fails', 'extremely', 'costly', 'attempt', 'attack', 'attacker', 'needs', 'large', 'amounts', 'delegated', 'matic', 's', 'currently', '4b', 'total', 'matic', 'staked', '5b', 'time', 'report', 'attempt', 'attack', 'attacker', 'needs', '16b', 'matic', '2checkpoint', '5', 'hours', 'attack', 'minimum', 'time', 'completely', 'unfeasible', 's', '55', 'm', 'matic', 'available', 'dexes', 'ethereum', 'polygon', 'modest', '10', 'm', 'matic', 'takes', '398', 'checkpoints', '47', 'days', '100', 'm', 'matic', 'takes', '4', 'days', 'point', 'conclusion', 'attack', 'polygon', 'security', 'team', 'takes', 'action', 'minimum', '5', 'hours', '16b', 'matic', '47', 'days', '10', 'm', 'matic', 'attack', 'completely', 'failsgiven', 'significant', 'nonrecoverable', 'eth', 'flashbots', 'unrealistically', 'large', 'matic', 'requirements', 'overwhelming', 'probability', 'successful', 'whitehat', 'counterresponse', 'report', 'downgraded', 'critical', 'high', 'polygon', 'team', 'feasible', 'exploit', 'practice', 'reviewed', 'case', 'detail', 'validate', 'judgment', 'concluded', 'fair', 'reasonable', 'require', 'detailed', 'explanation', 'reasoning', 'severity', 'needs', 'downgraded', 'imperative', 'ensure', 'whitehats', 'treated', 'fairly', 'nt', 'excellent', 'report', 'vulnerability', 'creative', 'report', 'written', 'whitehat', 'exceptional', 'goodfaith', 'actorso', 'fud', 'eylon', 'multiple', 'chats', 'ignorance', 'impossibility', 'exploitation', 'disingenuous', 'nt', 'help', 'notice', 'eylon', 'invested', 'competitor']"

329253,that is why kitchen sink mode is with polkadotjsorgapps while the extension is just a signer the same signer you use on something like singularapp to trade and mint nfts but we limit the feature set to just that because that is all we care about cross chain balance assets and crowdloan statuses are raeadable from subid and that is all that site does etc that is how it should work i wish ethspace understood this rather than peppering me with switch network laziness on every new tab i open,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

329493,the problem i see with it now is that with all financial censorship weve seen in the past week i could honestly see usdc censoring moreif governments can pressure everyone on swift to kick out an entire country how hard would it be to pressure the usdc people to blacklist a crucial defi smart contract it just seems like defi is setting itself up to not be that resilient,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'problem', 'financial', 'censorship', 've', 'seen', 'past', 'week', 'honestly', 'usdc', 'censoring', 'moreif', 'governments', 'pressure', 'swift', 'kick', 'entire', 'country', 'hard', 'pressure', 'usdc', 'people', 'blacklist', 'crucial', 'defi', 'smart', 'contract', 'like', 'defi', 'setting', 'resilient']"

329842,this omg they are geo blocking lets avoid them is a bit of a weird narrative now where have you been in the past defi year the geo blocking making sign a disclaimer w ur wallet have been a thing for a long time gradually projects open source their uis so you could even circumvent that and run your own or they dont force ip blocking while letting you soft consent to some random disclaimers they also cant openly say hey go use this illegal frontend obviously just have a bit of brains to research that now its fundamentally different if its on the lower level of infura but the rest holds same,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
329849,sure that seems fair i meant more in the context of defi and more complex solutions where id expect users to have more brains in other context for the really retail ye likely more us friendly stuff and that will also be made an opportunity anyway i am not disagreeing with you per se,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

329885,usdt banned addeess,"['tether', 'usdt']"
329886,oh right sorry since usdt hasnt banned the sanction list yet that means it would never happen no risk whatsoever my apology for being so shortsighted i didnt claim they banned based on political reasons yet i wrote that 350m of assets is seized they can do it in a matter of seconds with the current trend that even wallets dex etc restricted their access based on regulator requests its only a matter of time until centralized stablecoins will follow,"['tether', 'usdt', 'ethereum classic', 'etc', 'oh', 'right', 'sorry', 'usdt', 'nt', 'banned', 'sanction', 'list', 'means', 'happen', 'risk', 'whatsoever', 'apology', 'shortsighted', 'nt', 'claim', 'banned', 'based', 'political', 'reasons', 'wrote', '350', 'm', 'assets', 'seized', 'matter', 'seconds', 'current', 'trend', 'wallets', 'dex', 'etc', 'restricted', 'access', 'based', 'regulator', 'requests', 'matter', 'time', 'centralized', 'stablecoins', 'follow']"

329900,i understand your point of you but this is not limited geofencing due to securities issue or censuring few smart contract pairs securities on the frontend what is happening now has wide implications greatly affects ordinary users for example opensea is a centralized platform but we have to be prepared that just like theyve blocked iranian or russian artists and buyers they will one day block chinese or indian if the govt says so or hints so and just like they are blocking the whole countries they may go after individuals as well with blocking or seizing and i am not talking war here there may be situations like divorce investigation ppl unaware of proximity of tainted coins etc crypto world will be split in two very soon i hope that this will wake up developers of blue chip projects to start thinking about best practices when it comes to frontends decentralizing governance and code updates asap that ethereum community will decide to not impose infra by default on their platforms work on improving decentralized infrastructure it seems now that we were not prepared for this as the development of different parts of the web3 puzzle was not going hand in hand,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

334392,do kwon was mentioning thorchain in a twitter spaces last night and now i see that on monday a native luna eth swap pool goes live on thorswap wonder if there is any correlation,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334397,metis is the most expensive eth l2 right now isnt it,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334406,whats the best way to send text based message to say 1000 addresses on eth and whats the cheapest way to do so,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334419,yes main issue with 1000 messages for accounts is spammingif you can do that over9000 spammers will do that tooany evm chain has same eth address space so you can use cheapest for that,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334423,hi is it possible to revoke approvals for eth on revokecash i only see options for weth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334425,you cant approve afaik eth hence weth is used eth is not an erc20 token,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334427,pretty sure eth isnt a fork,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334440,idk if cmc is the best source of any information id choose coingecko over cmc any day,"['coinmarketcap', 'cmc', 'coinmarketcap', 'cmc', 'idk', 'cmc', 'best', 'source', 'information', 'd', 'choose', 'coingecko', 'cmc', 'day']"

334545,isnt it essentially timediscrete arbitragethe pic shows calendar arbitrage where youre profiting on theta curve diffs but just showing the concepteg you sell a put 3000 eth strike you buy another one 3000 becoming more neutral or neutral earning staking rewards on the sidethe main thing is not getting neuteredcorrect me as i may be wrong,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334546,i have been in yusdceth put selling for 2 epoches since the lm round 2 started pocketed 2 rounds of profit with lm but yes if eth rekt you will lose money cash secured put is somewhat bullish strategy that betting eth wont get rekt too much within a week,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', '“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', '“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt', 'yusdceth', 'selling', '2', 'epoches', 'lm', 'round', '2', 'started', 'pocketed', '2', 'rounds', 'profit', 'lm', 'yes', 'eth', 'rekt', 'lose', 'money', 'cash', 'secured', 'somewhat', 'bullish', 'strategy', 'betting', 'eth', 'wo', 'nt', 'rekt', 'week']"

334548,can we do this invest equal amount of eth cc and csp in a way this is called short straddle shorting volatility works well in crab market,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
334549,but it is a bet that market is crabbing if pump or rekt will not fare that well,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
334559,yes in cc you supply eth of cos you long it but your view is crabby market so cc csp win both side,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

334719,that makes sense i understand how thats a big deal for tokens that only have synthetics on certain chains like eth on solanaterra but how is that groundbreaking compared to when youre bridging usdc from chain a to chain b where usdc on destination chain is not a synthetic issued by a bridge,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'makes', 'sense', 'understand', 's', 'big', 'deal', 'tokens', 'synthetics', 'certain', 'chains', 'like', 'eth', 'solanaterra', 'groundbreaking', 'compared', 'bridging', 'usdc', 'chain', 'chain', 'b', 'usdc', 'destination', 'chain', 'synthetic', 'issued', 'bridge']"

334820,why dont people just have two computers one for their defi stuff with a hardware wallet and one for their other stuff,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
334823,doing defi with a hw wallet can be hard too if you have a lot of positions or need to be able to make fast moves i would think the better two computer setup would be the old hot wallet with x amount of fluid assets then everything that doesnt need to be moved with any urgency on the other,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

334909,if any of you have your usdc invested in maple you probably want to take it out as they are allowing some insane stuff to happen,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
334918,my point is that mpls price should be likely lower after you learn that big part of their income comes from someone borrowing usdc to put it back into the pool,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
334925,what type of working style is ideal for defi or i guess crypto web3 etc in general does anyone find themselves to be more nomadic going from project to project especially during the start up phase and leaving before the day to daydaily routine phase kicks in or do they push through in order to define themselves a clear role and stick around for the daily routine,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'ethereum classic', 'etc', 'type', 'working', 'style', 'ideal', 'defi', 'guess', 'crypto', 'web3', 'etc', 'general', 'find', 'nomadic', 'going', 'project', 'project', 'especially', 'start', 'phase', 'leaving', 'day', 'daydaily', 'routine', 'phase', 'kicks', 'push', 'order', 'define', 'clear', 'role', 'stick', 'daily', 'routine']"
334936,did you buy xlm,"['stellar', 'xlm']"
334980,you can do it via interaction with an archive rpc node and some indexer like covalentmoralis both have free plans to try it out be wary of rate limiting though alternatively you can use scan api as an indexerfirst you need to compile a list of addresses for reimbursement this is most likely all addresses ever interacted with some contract a this is done via indexer just look up transaction history for a and filter out needed interactionlastly you need some metric for reimbursement this might be token balance on a given blockheight or values of some view function of your contract asomeusermetric this is where archive node comes in iterate through a list of addresses and ask the node what was the view function value at needed block heightdont forget to log all that so you dont have to start from scratch in case of bugtimeoutetc,"['application programming interface', 'api']"
335001,at least for bridges which have latency in essence it would be nice security not sure about amm or other defi protocols,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
335002,ye for bridges not seeing it as negative per se but then think about what bridges can be used for the same defi protocols being multichain if bridges had this every protocol would need to be aave style multichain and not crosschain am i using the terms correctly,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
335009,i think better approach is to add priority execution feature to flashbots this priority execution is available only for special bots that tracks what happens inside defi protocols smart contracts are operations in mempool safe for em or not if bot sees some malicious operation it could can pause protocolrelatively speaking if all the top defi protocols implement such bots with passable feature this will rather reliably protect them from hacks,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'think', 'better', 'approach', 'add', 'priority', 'execution', 'feature', 'flashbots', 'priority', 'execution', 'available', 'special', 'bots', 'tracks', 'happens', 'inside', 'defi', 'protocols', 'smart', 'contracts', 'operations', 'mempool', 'safe', 'em', 'bot', 'sees', 'malicious', 'operation', 'pause', 'protocolrelatively', 'speaking', 'defi', 'protocols', 'implement', 'bots', 'passable', 'feature', 'reliably', 'protect', 'hacks']"
335029,you could average the withdrawal volume of your protocol and then lock it down if it exceeds ntimes that threshold thats basically what circuit breakers are tricky in defi because we like it when things run autonomously not sure if we would want protocols to be manually resumed even if its by multisigdao,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
335036,and then after that we can add kyc so we can always catch the bad guys,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
335047,eth global one of the main sponsors yas very much looking forward,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
335087,hi can someone pls explain how does the implementation process of approved proposals in daos workafter 10 years exp in law i understand that the process of transformation the decisions made and described in human language to form an llc to approve money spending etc into a legal statements in daos in code or the set of approved actions is not simple moreover the further interpretation of final legal statements can distort the initial intentionsso the question is who is in charge of implementation of decisions made by dao if were talking about decisions which requires code upgrade are there any companies who audit new code and confirm that new code fits the decision if no how can a usual daomember without itknowledge be sure that new code fits the decision if the decision requires certain actions are there any standards of how dao for example dao committees or other daos bodies should confirm that decision is properly implemented,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

335521,lets keep any companies like neptune aside for the discussion as i do not intend to highlight any specific projects lets only consider issues in the insurance products today there are 2 major hurdles first is defi insurances work in a centralized manner users have to prove the loss of funds in exploits while filing for the claims there are committees or appointees who are representing the insurance platform such folks go through the claim examine the issues and decide whether to payout the insurance claim or not based on their own discretionand second is each user has to file the claim separately if there is an exploit it affects all users who bought insurance cover and should be paid all at once irrespective of whether they file the claim or not some platforms even have kycs,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

336479,anyone here from defi safety,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
336489,do you also feel the same way about steth and lido when i compare vecrv to staked eth in validators people usually start to understand the elegance of the vetoken system the entire point is that it is nontransferrable and another entity which isnt the actual protocol must hypothecate its derivative just like steth and eth in lido,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'feel', 'way', 'steth', 'lido', 'compare', 'vecrv', 'staked', 'eth', 'validators', 'people', 'usually', 'start', 'understand', 'elegance', 'vetoken', 'system', 'entire', 'point', 'nontransferrable', 'entity', 'nt', 'actual', 'protocol', 'hypothecate', 'derivative', 'like', 'steth', 'eth', 'lido']"
336492,partially while i personally think eth has less governance impact on the eth chain itself it still leads to centralizationwhile steth actually stands for eth rewards aka a added bonus the system tends to work better as cvxcrv is nothing but a farm token steth has somewhat a value backing it nonetheless the staked eth is controlled by lido which is controlled by its governance token where almost all votes are privateseed teamso ye centralized in itself nonetheless not exactly the same model imo,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'partially', 'personally', 'think', 'eth', 'governance', 'impact', 'eth', 'chain', 'leads', 'centralizationwhile', 'steth', 'actually', 'stands', 'eth', 'rewards', 'aka', 'added', 'bonus', 'system', 'tends', 'work', 'better', 'cvxcrv', 'farm', 'token', 'steth', 'somewhat', 'value', 'backing', 'nonetheless', 'staked', 'eth', 'controlled', 'lido', 'controlled', 'governance', 'token', 'votes', 'privateseed', 'teamso', 'ye', 'centralized', 'nonetheless', 'exactly', 'model', 'imo']"
336494,the main conceptual parts are the same between the two because the point is that if the vetoken was transferrable it would defeat the entire point of the system the same way that if staked eth was wrapped and transferrable on the protocol level it would remove all security guaranteesslashing of block producers,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
336500,not sure if the nfts are the optimal solution but they are the defi attempt while the other attempt is relying on 1 entity to be trustful,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
336505,i think you are missing the point im making entirely i agree with you that having a single entity being a monopoly on the derivative issuance layer is bad but what i am pointing out is that if the protocol itself is the one that allows staked tokens to be wrapped and transferrable whether nfts or just erc20 tokens it is entirely selfdefeating it is as pointless as if ethereum issued a wrapped erc20 token representing staked eth in validators that would defeat the entire point of staking the eth in the validator in the first place,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'think', 'missing', 'point', 'm', 'making', 'entirely', 'agree', 'having', 'single', 'entity', 'monopoly', 'derivative', 'issuance', 'layer', 'bad', 'pointing', 'protocol', 'allows', 'staked', 'tokens', 'wrapped', 'transferrable', 'nfts', 'erc20', 'tokens', 'entirely', 'selfdefeating', 'pointless', 'ethereum', 'issued', 'wrapped', 'erc20', 'token', 'representing', 'staked', 'eth', 'validators', 'defeat', 'entire', 'point', 'staking', 'eth', 'validator', 'place']"
336512,no it does not because for example lido still has to care about its behavior otherwise the eth backing its steth gets slashed same thing with convex the vecrv and vefxs that it holds will depreciate in value if they destroy the protocols that they hold staked tokens in contrast this with the alternative being proposed where the protocol itself will give a transferrable token representing the staked asset to the end user who can then just vote or produce blocks with the token then dump it instantaneously in the same block and you can see why it is a selfdefeating feature,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
336518,venfts are pretty much not sellable aside from some otc or whateverthe real important part is when it comes to utilization borrowing against it etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
336522,not really i already explained that i agree with you that a monopoly on one entity controlling most of the staked asset should be avoided obviously the entire point is to make sure that a vibrant economy of entities form that hypothecate the derivative of the staked nontransferrable token just like how we hope that will be the case for staked eth and it wont be a single man show with lido,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
336524,the way to fight a monopoly is not to wrap the staked asset on the protocol layer and thus completely ruin the economic system the way to solve it is to foster a vibrant decentralized distribution of the staked asset you are basically arguing eth should issue a wrapped version of its staked eth so that lido cannot capture 51 of the staked eth that is a terrible idea because issuing liquid staked eth completely destroys the security guarantees of pos,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'way', 'fight', 'monopoly', 'wrap', 'staked', 'asset', 'protocol', 'layer', 'completely', 'ruin', 'economic', 'system', 'way', 'solve', 'foster', 'vibrant', 'decentralized', 'distribution', 'staked', 'asset', 'basically', 'arguing', 'eth', 'issue', 'wrapped', 'version', 'staked', 'eth', 'lido', 'capture', '51', 'staked', 'eth', 'terrible', 'idea', 'issuing', 'liquid', 'staked', 'eth', 'completely', 'destroys', 'security', 'guarantees', 'pos']"
336527,a wrapped staked eth and a venft is not really the sameone is liquid and the other is not really but ye the whole models are not completly matured yet imo and we will see how it ends,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
336528,its not bad for the performance and maybe eco but it has not much to do with defi or a proper governance structure,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
336531,ya we will see how it evolves but i think that the vetoken system is misunderstood by a lot of people it is more similar to staked eth and steth on the dapp layer than anything else once you view it like that it helps frame the economics a bit more,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
336568,ok right convex docs say you lock crv forever and user gets back cvxcrv which is liquid and then you need to lock cvx for 16 weeks to vote so i guess convex socializes the 4 year period down to smaller 16 week chunks trying to get how convex improves things i see they have a function to boot inactive locked cvx thats not voting after 4 weekstrying to figure out how else convex actually fixes or completes whats missing in curve and therefore solidly rekt food farmer has good videos on this stuff,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"

337059,i could certainly see someone making a risk score per wallet based on some already known patterns interacted with tornado hold some compromised eth not sure if something as specific as did this wallet do this hack is relevant at that level all one needs to do is keep monitoring wallets for abnormal activity and then dig deeper when needed manually,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

340459,all fiscal systems are the products of human greed crypto will be corrupted by it but it buys us more timein the meantime it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for innovation in finance lots of people have lost money but lots of people are also making far higher returns than would have ever been normally possible prior to defi expecting a perfect system and abandoning your work when its just as flawed as you are is sad we cannot hope for perfect only better,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
340463,i mean i was bitching about a lot of defi on eth being built on small multisigs since summer 2020 so like,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'mean', 'bitching', 'lot', 'defi', 'eth', 'built', 'small', 'multisigs', 'summer', '2020', 'like']"
340464,nah his writing is brilliant metamodernist trolling of cryptocommunity its like ai trained on ct answered the question write the article that will piss off the most peoplehis next move is going to be a release of some insane cryptoanarchist project that will be complete opposite of bullshit he wrote,"['crypto twitter', 'ct']"
340478,he realizes fantom cant compete without an edge that edge is being the kyc chain,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
340510,having purely immutable contracts would kill 95 of defi this would include almost all lending protocols and by extension any protocols that depend on them as a base layer perhaps people would be fine with that but is that really what people want an extremely rigid capital inefficient financial system i suspect they dont shouts into the void as artem runs off with fingers in his ears,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

340796,by layer zero consensus of how people feel so like eth is canon over etc but uniswap is definitely canon over sushi my best guess is people will see the existing solidly as noncanon because the creator is no longer working on it its got bugs its open source so it almost seems fair game and beneficial to reboot,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ethereum classic', 'etc', 'layer', 'zero', 'consensus', 'people', 'feel', 'like', 'eth', 'canon', 'etc', 'uniswap', 'definitely', 'canon', 'sushi', 'best', 'guess', 'people', 'existing', 'solidly', 'noncanon', 'creator', 'longer', 'working', 'got', 'bugs', 'open', 'source', 'fair', 'game', 'beneficial', 'reboot']"

340906,hey everyonedo you guys know where i could find info regarding protocols exploits and their correlation or not to auditsi found some info saying that 2122 of protocols exploited were unaudited but it doesnt mean much if we dont know the global percentage of unaudited protocols and the range studied like maybe top 1000 projects or something like that same goes with the info available on rekt,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"

341058,youre 100 correct that the escrow risk persists indefinitely post settlement layer transfer but two questions1 how do we get exposure to assets like eth that have a supply peg on mainnet we need a representational asset to capitalize the pools in a liquidity network like stargate right unless were only ever expecting fully native deployments like usdc which permissionless tokens dont offer2 what youre flagging is application risk in the smart contract that performs the escrow function if this is bulletproof does your apprehension go away,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', '100', 'correct', 'escrow', 'risk', 'persists', 'indefinitely', 'post', 'settlement', 'layer', 'transfer', 'questions1', 'exposure', 'assets', 'like', 'eth', 'supply', 'peg', 'mainnet', 'need', 'representational', 'asset', 'capitalize', 'pools', 'liquidity', 'network', 'like', 'stargate', 'right', 'expecting', 'fully', 'native', 'deployments', 'like', 'usdc', 'permissionless', 'tokens', 'nt', 'offer2', 'flagging', 'application', 'risk', 'smart', 'contract', 'performs', 'escrow', 'function', 'bulletproof', 'apprehension', 'away']"

341157,this just isnt true plenty of protocols do fine without money printers yearn maker uniswap etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
341159,i think theres something to be said about the lindyness of something like compound or aave vs new lending protocols with high incentives yes hot money will rotate to the new things but as noncrypto biz fintechs institutions etc are looking for a yield partner theyll be looking to compound and aave not new hot money thing from my casual reading of this it seems like gfx presented good arguments that cutting comp rewards by 50 did not have a drastic impact on tvl and that it seems like most of the concerns were around it felt too rushed cutting incentives to 0,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
341180,lol this is on the level of eos claiming its more decentralized than ethereum because of a paintjpg screenshot,"['eos.io', 'eos']"
341181,ummm our nakamoto coefficent is higher than eth 2,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
341202,if you want people to argue in good faith and take you seriously you gotta do better,"['technical analysis or trend analysis', 'ta']"
341204,eth people make 0 effort to understand what is being built in cosmos im tired of the same old takes that dont reflect reality i would also ask you to do better,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
341206,well the vast majority of eth defi contracts are owned by multisigs or single signer keys,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'vast', 'majority', 'eth', 'defi', 'contracts', 'owned', 'multisigs', 'single', 'signer', 'keys']"
341212,i mean one of the largest defi protocols in existence is technically a 35 multisigcertainly not all but that is a conversation worth having,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

341309,for point 24 we are working collabing in decentralized science or desci many of desci projects are inspired by defi but due to novelty lack primitives protocols nor codeknowlegde base as defi from one perspective desci is aligning more towards nft both technically and aesthetically but i think changing angleofattacks economically convolutions and modelbased systems will emerge and present revelations that will one day have desci stand sidebyside with defi you or anyone feel free to shoot dm if you want to shoot on this,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'point', '24', 'working', 'collabing', 'decentralized', 'science', 'desci', 'desci', 'projects', 'inspired', 'defi', 'novelty', 'lack', 'primitives', 'protocols', 'codeknowlegde', 'base', 'defi', 'perspective', 'desci', 'aligning', 'nft', 'technically', 'aesthetically', 'think', 'changing', 'angleofattacks', 'economically', 'convolutions', 'modelbased', 'systems', 'emerge', 'present', 'revelations', 'day', 'desci', 'stand', 'sidebyside', 'defi', 'feel', 'free', 'shoot', 'dm', 'want', 'shoot']"
341318,also if doing etl on bulk data from all chains gonna need a fuckton more storage than what the nodes require on their own and that is excluding backups maintainence etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

341320,thanks for eth alchemy worked best so far but still got ratelimited quickly,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
341323,is there a defi ethics similar to nft ethics,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

341411,why eth global have only 16k subs while pumpers and dumpers have over 300400k subs on youtube,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
341412,eth global not halping the by organising soo many events,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
341433,friends whats the latest on running your own eth node for use with your dapp i mean front end will always use whatever rpc the client wallet uses right but back end can rely on your own i remember there was something like geth lite in the works so you dont need the gazillion storage still a thing,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
341451,then build a script that would call cexs api for withdrawals,"['application programming interface', 'api']"
341476,our frontend domains are owned by the dao avoids single person owning a eth domain avoids dns names that are bound to censorship and tied to a single email only way to make frontend updates are to make a governance proposal and can be turned down by the rep holders if found its a bad update rep is non transferable governance token that can be earned only through contribution to the daothe way we achieve this is by handing over the ens domain to the dao proposal created to update ens to point to new ipfs hash voted and boosted by the governance process and if passed ens now points to new ipfs hashwe have no google analytics or any analytics that depends upon centralised parties if you want to privately use uniswap sushiswap you can always use swapreth as it directly talks to their contracts without taking any fee routing through another contract its pretty decentralised compared to every other frontend i would say,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
341486,hey i was trying to do some research on a token and came across something weird if you take a look at their pools the positions were generated with only the erc20 tokens and 0 usdc anyone has any idea what is going on,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"

341651,hi read in messari article aboud stakinkg derivatives that eth derivatives currently represent originally staked eth plus all earned staking rewards since december 2020 ankreth projects this underlying value at currently 1 ankreth 1051 eth is it true for steth from lido so the real price of steth should be more than 1 eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'hi', 'read', 'messari', 'article', 'aboud', 'stakinkg', 'derivatives', 'eth', 'derivatives', 'currently', 'represent', 'originally', 'staked', 'eth', 'plus', 'earned', 'staking', 'rewards', 'december', '2020', 'ankreth', 'projects', 'underlying', 'value', 'currently', '1', 'ankreth', '1051', 'eth', 'true', 'steth', 'lido', 'real', 'price', 'steth', '1', 'eth']"

344867,well 4pool hadnt really started up yet but we are staying the course with ust i believe in do its important to note that frax is as unaffected by the contents of 4pool as usdc is namely it does not directly matter to us if a specific stablecoin depegs frax is safe,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"

346475,usdt is safe,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346477,probably as unsafe as the actual usd us economy is same is about usdc perhaps,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346478,why people are swapping usdt to usdc busd,"['tether', 'usdt', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'people', 'swapping', 'usdt', 'usdc', 'busd']"
346479,and on 3pool crv usdt taken 80 pool,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346481,good question but i dont think there are unnatural reasons theremaybe usdc and busd are easier to redeem and people do that,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346484,well theres really little area of use for usdt in ethereum defi for instance you cant use it as collateral in aave v2 havent tried v3 not sure about it,"['tether', 'usdt', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 's', 'little', 'area', 'use', 'usdt', 'ethereum', 'defi', 'instance', 'nt', 'use', 'collateral', 'aave', 'v2', 'nt', 'tried', 'v3', 'sure']"
346493,most pools with deep liquidity are either with usdc or dai on ethereum at least,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346496,and stablecoin liquidity for usdt is also big,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346508,during the thick of the ico frenzy defi was berated too,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
346516,adult thinking person puts life savings in crypto thing based on the marketing rather than well the manual hmm deposit your money into atlantiseth to receive a ticket to the lost island only deposits above 1 eth or more accepted,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
346535,yeah everyone is exchanging for usdc,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346538,i imagine usdt is under pressure probably due to the persistent lack of trust but off by 0005 happens basically every day,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346569,usdc strategy people want to cash out redeem fees,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346574,i use tron to move usdt across exchanges fast and cheap,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346576,usdt is moved through tron to arb between exchanges afaik,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346591,usdc and dai are now 102 while usdtdai is 097 on binance,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346597,this is irrelevant in btc the block contains a tx from coinbase to miner and is required by the protocol eth is different,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
346598,sure f2pool still gets the eth mining reward but i guess they dont care about tx fees they seem to only be mining mev txs maybe mev is drying up right now cause gas prices too high that doesnt make sense to me tho,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
346600,i would not hold any dervs with usdt,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346601,yeah but binance futures are mainly in usdt,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346606,not the same pairs more pairs are on usdt but how the liquidation is affected by a change in the value of the base pair,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346607,people are currently fleeing usdt so busd dai and usdc are going up,"['tether', 'usdt', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'people', 'currently', 'fleeing', 'usdt', 'busd', 'dai', 'usdc', 'going']"
346609,wait how will a tether depeg work theoretically unless and until its proven that tether isnt 100 backed by usd and equivalent in value shouldnt 1 usdt be always redeemable for 1 usd,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346621,yesterday i posted about usdt depeggin and some1 deleted my message,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346623,atleast you have a job mcdonalds fired me today coz i threw fries on some guy who was doing ta on ust,"['technical analysis or trend analysis', 'ta']"
346628,usdc is backed by cash and gov bonds only now,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346629,is it true that usdt is only backed by btc and they just pay fines,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346631,yep but my point is as long as tether lets you redeem 1 usdt for 1 usd and doesnt stop their larp its just pool imbalance that should be fixed via arbs not really depeg,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346632,usdt depegged liquidation short vcs and mms could sell crypto assets with higher price in usdt redeem usdt 1 at tether,"['tether', 'usdt', 'tether', 'usdt', 'tether', 'usdt', 'usdt', 'depegged', 'liquidation', 'short', 'vcs', 'mms', 'sell', 'crypto', 'assets', 'higher', 'price', 'usdt', 'redeem', 'usdt', '1', 'tether']"
346637,tiktok investors were right usdc 5,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346641,even stables ivan is rekt,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
346654,if u are afraid of the usdt depeg buy some eth,"['tether', 'usdt', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'u', 'afraid', 'usdt', 'depeg', 'buy', 'eth']"
346662,i ve seen a tiktok video where the guy was mentioning a 23x potential for usdt,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346671,usdt collateral mix is all going to hell maybe that has something to do with what is going on sunac chinese re company missing bond payments,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346677,given the level of understanding of most crypto users i wouldnt be suprised if some of them confused usdt with ust,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346687,this is why us wants to regulate stables if usdt faces bank run and it holds treasury notes that means that market is flooded with them bad for uncle sam,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346699,how do the mechanisms for dai frax usdc tether compare if they face a run are there significantly different liquidationredemption triggers for example,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346703,backed irl cash reserves or promises blabla notes or some other chinese bills was case w tether wasnt itonchain algo ha or not multicollateral or no etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
346706,sorry i know its a newbie question i know that dai is overcollateralised so as the eth price falls there will be increased collateral liquidation is there anyone that might have modeled this scenario for various stables im imagining a graph showing resiliencyelasticity against sell force maybe revealing some shelves,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
346737,can usdc in scs be frozen or clawedback,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346749,yeah imagine usdc blacklisting the 3pool contract would be a total mess,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
346779,because usd is slow the arb opportunity might not exist after youve managed to deposit etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
346781,buy 100 usd worth of usdt 100xredeem 100x usdt for 100x usdx profit,"['tether', 'usdt', 'tether', 'usdt', 'buy', '100', 'usd', 'worth', 'usdt', '100xredeem', '100x', 'usdt', '100x', 'usdx', 'profit']"
346783,you cant redeem 100 usdt anyway,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346792,sure it does to redeem tether its not instant requires kyc and payments could be like 35 working days,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
346796,you would still get more usdt than usd worth,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346799,rook holder eventually going to be wealthy after years of rekt lol,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
346806,if someone market sells 1m of usdt into usdc for example and theres only 900k of usdc in bids on the order book at 09999 usd it will start to fill orders lower down which reports the lower price of execution,"['tether', 'usdt', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'market', 'sells', '1', 'm', 'usdt', 'usdc', 'example', 's', '900k', 'usdc', 'bids', 'order', 'book', '09999', 'usd', 'start', 'fill', 'orders', 'lower', 'reports', 'lower', 'price', 'execution']"
346816,if i may propose a brief distraction could anyone pls eli5 the difference between the omni layer and rootstock as far as i can tell rsk use cases are a superset of the omni layer the latter just enables custom asset creation but without a vm for smart contract execution is this correct,"['explain it like i’m 5', 'eli5']"
346901,hope someone tries to break the peg so i can get some free eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
346911,usdt fudders read this,"['tether', 'usdt']"
346916,but it is large 2b on curve then also balancer etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
346925,so anyone who wants fresh and shiny eth 20 can observe,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
346987,gotta prepare for all the new compliancing,"['technical analysis or trend analysis', 'ta']"

347000,797291232 usdt 797291232 usd transferred from bitfinex to tether treasury,"['tether', 'usdt']"
347013,can some big brain eli5 why all markets is coupled to ust collapse in the beginning they still have btc reserve to defend peg so btc is coupled and the rest will dump based on coupling with btc but now that they are out of btc i guess only luna is coupled and will go to 0 why the rest is still correlated i can see there are arbs here and there and perhaps people are panicking so introducing irrational correlationis ust deeply used as collateral in other markets and defi protocols sorry did not really play and follow this ponzi if so only those pairing can be correlated and not the whole fking markets right so the dump is really due to irrational selling,"['explain it like i’m 5', 'eli5', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'big', 'brain', 'eli5', 'markets', 'coupled', 'ust', 'collapse', 'beginning', 'btc', 'reserve', 'defend', 'peg', 'btc', 'coupled', 'rest', 'dump', 'based', 'coupling', 'btc', 'btc', 'guess', 'luna', 'coupled', '0', 'rest', 'correlated', 'arbs', 'people', 'panicking', 'introducing', 'irrational', 'correlationis', 'ust', 'deeply', 'collateral', 'markets', 'defi', 'protocols', 'sorry', 'play', 'follow', 'ponzi', 'pairing', 'correlated', 'fking', 'markets', 'right', 'dump', 'irrational', 'selling']"

347028,yes minting a tons of luna and get rekt,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
347033,i want some non investment advise if i am in the camp that we will be in crypto winter soon and will get to buy sub 1k eth at some point but i cant get myself to sell because of the merge as the catalyst is merge a bad reason to keep holding,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
347038,merge is a big event with eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
347040,but stop hearing about the shilling that eth will be up only when merge happens,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

347109,if u use cmc as a source for an oracle price arguments are gone,"['coinmarketcap', 'cmc']"
347112,even usdt was off,"['tether', 'usdt']"
347116,yeah even usdc or dai had cex depeges remember compoud oracle exploit,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
347121,luna has the same utility as eth,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

347153,sers could you explain how this stetheth unpeg will potentially affect on eth price fluctuations and more important why it can affect,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
347154,should reduce sell pressure as selling staked eth should be more painful and less attractive,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
347210,would have to disagree on this onenear price is shite but the network is great usn is a nice alternative to a bank account and backed with usdt up to first 1b theres a fun ecosystem and the limited infra they have is good and well supported,"['tether', 'usdt']"
347218,well minedude himself is giga rich so is probably everyone of the luna foundationthey wouldnt have baited with emergency plans etc for more exit liquidity if they wouldnt have made a full life money on this exit,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

347504,whole defi is built on oracle and many use chainlink and they can decide to pause it like that,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
347553,chainlink price feeds are just price oracles sourcing data from multiple venues i reckon every defi protocol on ethevms uses link oracles,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

347581,yeah true idk what point i was trying make still they will have caused sooo many people to get rekt,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"

347602,dunno if ivan will block me for dragging this on but personally i find it disgusting how vcs that have been shilling a known scam are now not even able to say the simple english word sorry for having shilled a scam to young desperate and uninformed peoplesorry for spamming but imo we as a community must get better at speaking up and defi protocols must get better at not just incorporating every junk token and then finger pointing at chainlink,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
347621,im all libertarian but i also dealt with people crying who lost their jobs and all clue what theyre supposed to do now and i was too rekt myself to offer them a jobim also against cancelling people but the investors influencers who shilled young desperate kids who got failed by boomer economy with their little savings into ust should be shamed out of this space not pretty but imo thats on us now,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
347635,this is probably a badly phrased summary there were a few courses of action that the terra team could have taken regardless of the design flaws in hindsight it probably would have been the right move to completely freeze the luna mint mechanism when it became apparent that the peg could not be saved then they should have announced that they will determine bad debt and work on raising funds put the whole thing into runoffjust letting the protocol run its course might be the most defi thing but it certainly was not the most sensible move in terms of mitigating damageedit somewhat like this,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

347724,yes but another thing you arent counting is in the event that the nonpol liquidity is withdrawn and sold like that the amo would consistently burn the frax to keep the balance of the pool within stableswap peg range for an a factor of 1500 any remaining amount of frax left to be sold after that is a minority left compared to the other collateral the protocol has left hundreds of millions of locked liquidity on uni v3 etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
347742,well thats the problem i think we all agree that there needs to be collateral but what would be good collateral if you bar the fiat backed stablecoins,"['conventional government-issued currency (e.g. us dollar, euro)', 'fiat']"
347744,if it was interchangeable in principle they wouldve started out that way theres a difference between being 11 collateralized by a fiatcoin and 11 collateralized by eth theres also the funny fine print of them coming to own progressively less of the liquidity if it goes too far,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

349841,there is evidenz which publishes degrees and other private data on the blockchain from what i understand no hash or offchain storage involved the institution that publishes the data passes some kind of kyc on its address the institution uses the evidenz dapp to encrypt the data and then store it on the chain with a tx then some shamir secret sharing shenanigans that i dont understand make it so that the owner of the data the student can control who can decrypt his data by sharingdeleting his key,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
349843,railgun applies this to your wallet balance and eth transactions they become private and other people cant view them,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

350054,why u think that single sequencer is a centralization here its not a chain with validators its optimistic rollup so the security level of the l2 is relaying on eth consensus basically eth is a source of tx merkle roots for l2 or im missing something here have more experience with op not arbitrum,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'u', 'think', 'single', 'sequencer', 'centralization', 'chain', 'validators', 'optimistic', 'rollup', 'security', 'level', 'l2', 'relaying', 'eth', 'consensus', 'basically', 'eth', 'source', 'tx', 'merkle', 'roots', 'l2', 'm', 'missing', 'experience', 'op', 'arbitrum']"
350055,well if sequencer stops processing transactions you are kinda rekt right or if there is some bug on the fault proof implementation,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
350126,nontransferable is good plus there is this added idea of adding request for transfer into the contract such that if someone requests a move of a token to address x if 65 or so of the other voters support it the move can go through is kind of like social recovery of nontransferables in case of wallet losses etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
350155,also not true you build a leveraged longshort position on correlated assets in much the same way consider the folding strategy on ethsteth deposit 1k stethmint 5k eth swap 5k eth for stethyou now have a leveraged long on steth and short on eth the price movement is less of an issue notwishtanding recent events but you should still be concerned about time to liquidation because of the cost of borrowing,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'true', 'build', 'leveraged', 'longshort', 'position', 'correlated', 'assets', 'way', 'consider', 'folding', 'strategy', 'ethsteth', 'deposit', '1k', 'stethmint', '5k', 'eth', 'swap', '5k', 'eth', 'stethyou', 'leveraged', 'long', 'steth', 'short', 'eth', 'price', 'movement', 'issue', 'notwishtanding', 'recent', 'events', 'concerned', 'time', 'liquidation', 'cost', 'borrowing']"

350163,sure lets take you exampledeposit 1k stethmint 5k eth swap 5k eth for stethand then 2 more actionsaddliquidity on curve pool steth stecrvaddliquidity and stake on covex stecrv into staked convex position,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'sure', 'lets', 'exampledeposit', '1k', 'stethmint', '5k', 'eth', 'swap', '5k', 'eth', 'stethand', '2', 'actionsaddliquidity', 'curve', 'pool', 'steth', 'stecrvaddliquidity', 'stake', 'covex', 'stecrv', 'staked', 'convex', 'position']"
350164,but is that more efficient or just more leverage in your example you are now effectively using a staked convex position as collateral for an eth short your risk is much higher since youre dealing with more protocols and more leverage,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
350167,almost all yield in defi comes from people paying a premium to either swap or build a leveraged position,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"

350175,total liquidity isnt really relevant its all about how widely distributed the liquidity is if i want to manipulate a twap i need to send the spot price in a single block to something millions of higher or send the price to zero so imagine an order book for usdcusdt with 1m buy and sells placed at 099 and 101 above and below the 1 peg i can swap 1m usdc for 990k usdt and ive lost a small bit of money in slippage but every 1 more i swap sends the price straight to zero the order book is empty so the cost of manipulating this oracle is 10know imagine an order book with 1m buy orders spread evenly at 001 002 003 and so on same liquidity different order book profile now when i swap 1m usdc for usdt im actually paying a huge amount of slippage its going to totally rekt me moreover arbitrageurs can use the wide range liquidity to arb the price back up immediately so the slippage cost is higher and the arbitrage risk is greater when liquidity is fullrange than concentrated how do we measure the actual cost of attack right now we can use the current liquidity profile of the uniswap pool and simulate swaps by using static calls to the smart contracts to figure out how much it would cost for an attacker to move the twap price by 20 in a lot of cases it turns out this costs billions of dollars,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'tether', 'usdt', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'tether', 'usdt', '“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt', 'total', 'liquidity', 'nt', 'relevant', 'widely', 'distributed', 'liquidity', 'want', 'manipulate', 'twap', 'need', 'send', 'spot', 'price', 'single', 'block', 'millions', 'higher', 'send', 'price', 'zero', 'imagine', 'order', 'book', 'usdcusdt', '1', 'm', 'buy', 'sells', 'placed', '099', '101', '1', 'peg', 'swap', '1', 'm', 'usdc', '990k', 'usdt', 've', 'lost', 'small', 'bit', 'money', 'slippage', '1', 'swap', 'sends', 'price', 'straight', 'zero', 'order', 'book', 'cost', 'manipulating', 'oracle', '10know', 'imagine', 'order', 'book', '1', 'm', 'buy', 'orders', 'spread', 'evenly', '001', '002', '003', 'liquidity', 'different', 'order', 'book', 'profile', 'swap', '1', 'm', 'usdc', 'usdt', 'm', 'actually', 'paying', 'huge', 'slippage', 'going', 'totally', 'rekt', 'arbitrageurs', 'use', 'wide', 'range', 'liquidity', 'arb', 'price', 'immediately', 'slippage', 'cost', 'higher', 'arbitrage', 'risk', 'greater', 'liquidity', 'fullrange', 'concentrated', 'measure', 'actual', 'cost', 'attack', 'right', 'use', 'current', 'liquidity', 'profile', 'uniswap', 'pool', 'simulate', 'swaps', 'static', 'calls', 'smart', 'contracts', 'figure', 'cost', 'attacker', 'twap', 'price', '20', 'lot', 'cases', 'turns', 'costs', 'billions', 'dollars']"

355755,apologies for the long reply just thought id address some usual questions with a bunch of ways the bancor 3 protocol has to mitigate il minting bnt isnt the only way to pay for impermanent loss pools accrue fees and can be net positive or negative the il cost is socialised throughout the protocol meaning that the cost of il isnt significant il is also a very individual problem on xyk pools where an lp might be underwater while another one is positive these differences are balanced for everyones benefit there is a 025 withdrawal fee that is used to open an arbitrage opportunity whenever possible which aims to rebalance the bnt and token in each pool this mechanism helps distribute the cost of il throughout the whole protocol as well if a bank run starts happening on bancor the spot price and ema of the pools will differ by more than the minimum requirements 1 when this happens withdrawals are halted until the price stabilises there is a 7day cooldown period that allows the dao to implement actions to mitigate any form of bankrun should it see one happening bnt is a very liquid token on bancor lps getting back some of their stake in bnt and selling it for a token wont significantly impact the spot price of bnt on bancor also a lot of the bnt on bancor is owned by the protocol roughly 60 the bancor protocol uses 15 of the trading fees to atomically buy vbnt on each swap and burn it later this mechanism locks bnt forever in the protocol and supports bnts value the whitelisting process involves going through an internal audit process where the token contract is checked against the bancordao token requirements some of these requirements involve having a fair distribution of the token to avoid price manipulation no contract pausability no upgradeability no possibility to freeze transfers etc when a pool is created it goes into a bootstrapping phase the dao msig approves an initial price and bnt funding usually 10k 20k bnt additional bnt funding is increased by 2x and happens on new deposits when the spot price and ema dont differ by more than 1 this makes the pools liquidity ramp up slowly in case there is high volatility of the token vs bnt and distributes the token price vs bnt the bancordao can increase or decrease the funding limit of the vaults as part of the liquidity is trading and part is nontrading this means that the bancordao can now assess the risk involved with each token and choose a unique funding limit as well as pool fee if the pools go below the minimum funding limit theyre disabled until the dao msig approves them again there is a mechanism to guarantee lps get their stakes back even if the pool isnt funded anymore,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

359190,i think its partially marketing and partially devs expecting everyone or most people to know the same things they do and i guess not exclusive to them either i see this sentiment as though getting rekt is some kind of rite of passage at times most marketing types ive encountered are barely able to explain or understand the risks themselves and its entirely up to founders to recognize this and push for their users to be better educated,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"

359346,youd be surprised how deceitful they have been talking about collateralizing their stablecoin displaying ust as usd on some terra protocols i see you alice or even not fully presenting the risks uxd is algorithmic as well yet they clearly state that if their insurance fund goes to 0 and funding rates are negative theyre rekt this kind of transparency is important if ust clearly explained the risk and didnt try to sell the idea that it was in fact usd but with yield we wouldnt have so much retail rekt in that death spirale,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt', '“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt', 'd', 'surprised', 'deceitful', 'talking', 'collateralizing', 'stablecoin', 'displaying', 'ust', 'usd', 'terra', 'protocols', 'alice', 'fully', 'presenting', 'risks', 'uxd', 'algorithmic', 'clearly', 'state', 'insurance', 'fund', 'goes', '0', 'funding', 'rates', 'negative', 'rekt', 'kind', 'transparency', 'important', 'ust', 'clearly', 'explained', 'risk', 'nt', 'try', 'sell', 'idea', 'fact', 'usd', 'yield', 'nt', 'retail', 'rekt', 'death', 'spirale']"
359348,you think that is the reason retail got rekt,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
359349,retail would get rekt anyway with luna or without it imo,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
359353,kinda funny how this apparently ever innocent retail is somehow always able to do research after they rekt but somehow never before they put money into some contract people unironically think theyre entitled to riskfree profitmaking endeavors because they refuse or cant be bothered to read,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
359371,and it was presented as low risk yield from people whom others considered as professionals etc not saying its right but thats just how things works,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

359427,are you really trying to say that each project has done their utmost to clearly communicate the risks if so many people are getting rekt then there is a problem and most of that is to do with the messaging not getting across,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
359429,likewise rather than just going hurr durr u got rekt why not just make an effort to recognize that there is an actual issue with regards to how this is communicated to begin with lol,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"

362132,one of the uncommon core eth merge episodes had a good bit of discussion on it,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
362144,aave had usdc pegged at 1 usd and most of the positions should be in liquidation mode,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
362145,did aave peg usdc or was it just used as the reference asset eg on euler weth is pegged to equal 1 weth and everything is measured in those units,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
362158,potential solution here could be to check it with another oracle that checks peg between eth locked assets and native chain locked assets if peg breaks operations are not allowed just spitballing but def really interesting and worth tackling tbh,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
362163,so basically if you are pulling all your data from cexes then add a 50 weight of a native dex from that chain because its not native usdc and you can use it as such,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
362165,you cant really differentiate native chain price expect for using onchain values then youre prone to the same manipulations that a lot of onchain pricing is prone towards one solution is to implement another check for those bridged assets where an oracle reports if the locked supply on eg eth matches the circulating supply on eg harmony,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
362177,you first need to ask a more fundamental question what is the price of anything usually people say whatever someone is willing to pay for it so by that metric you need to find a recent trade for the asset in question if its some wrapped bridge asset then you need to find a price someone paid for that bridged asset not the underlying asset on some other network but the actual derivative itself thats the only truly correct way to do this you will complain that theres no way chainlink etc could be expected to do this for all bridge assets and youre right they cant fragmenting liquidity by bridging is bad news for everyone it breaks the fungibility of assets 1 wrapped abc is never worth exactly 1 abc theres almost always some discount that needs to be applied for liquidity risk cost to wrapunwrap opportunity cost and so on for bridged assets on the basis of what weve seen for the past 1218 months wrapped tokens are worth much less on average than their underlying so how do you fix this i dont think you can without having custom oracles for every asset personally i think the solution therefore lies in decentralised oracles that are derived from the underlying on a dex or group of dexs native to the environment in which something trades that way you are always getting a real price its not easy to create a secure decentralised oracle uniswap twaps arent bad but i think we can do better weve been working on this at euler,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

366897,speaking frankly the documentation on lbps was interesting but it was unclear on the permissionlessness of rewarding xeth pools with 3rd token y i really liked the idea of changing the weighting of pools over time but my goal wasnt to distribute a pile of tokens to buyers directly for price discovery it was to create an incentive to create the x token which must be minted from the protocolif i were looking to reward xeth pools in x token w a price discovery mechanism for x to raise eth for a daotreasury i think balancer lbps would have been a primary contender and honestly not opposed to doing a yeth lbp w y rewards via lbp in the futurebut curve was more clearly visible that you can do xeth with y rewards and it had examples like stetheth rewarded in ldo that made it easier to coordinate what i wanted wo trying to ask for something newunheard ofi didnt see examples of this on bal nor documentation on it outside of lbps for fair launch pricing,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

369465,but it lets u get eth from ethereum to avalanche without bridging,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

369475,as an issuer you would still be taking on the lending protocols risk sc liquidations solvency etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
369483,i mean if the objective is to have a custodian behind you can have the custody of the eth in full instead of using usdc,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'mean', 'objective', 'custodian', 'custody', 'eth', 'instead', 'usdc']"
369484,usdc euroc why not ethc,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
369486,no you can this way only have native assets as your eth would allow you to borrow avax for instance,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"

371030,the issue with that trade concept is its likely not alpha the easiest way to do is go put a stable or btc into compoundaaveetc borrow eth and just keep it and wait for ethalik to fork the issue is likely a second after fork people will sell their eth quite likely so that your position would go down and you would be underwater with the asset on hands even if you sell the extra eth on the fork cause on the main chain you still need to return your stable,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'issue', 'trade', 'concept', 'likely', 'alpha', 'easiest', 'way', 'stable', 'btc', 'compoundaaveetc', 'borrow', 'eth', 'wait', 'ethalik', 'fork', 'issue', 'likely', 'second', 'fork', 'people', 'sell', 'eth', 'likely', 'position', 'underwater', 'asset', 'hands', 'sell', 'extra', 'eth', 'fork', 'cause', 'main', 'chain', 'need', 'return', 'stable']"

371034,if you dont sell your eth youre not short,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371036,what would happen is that your collat is insta worth 0 on the fork chain so you get liquidated but you get to keep the forked eth anyway,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371045,if you simply buy eth now wouldnt it be much simpler as you would still get your eth on the fork so in essence you would have both ethpow and ethpos i am retarded btw,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'simply', 'buy', 'eth', 'nt', 'simpler', 'eth', 'fork', 'essence', 'ethpow', 'ethpos', 'retarded', 'btw']"
371049,yeah youd do the borrow eth trick only if you want zero price exposure in the meantime,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371051,but you multiply your money if you supply usdc and borrow ethsince on eth pos you keep it all 1x usdc and 08 ethon ethpow you get 08 ethpow 0802 or less ethso yeah not that big of an upside but still,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'multiply', 'money', 'supply', 'usdc', 'borrow', 'ethsince', 'eth', 'pos', '1x', 'usdc', '08', 'ethon', 'ethpow', '08', 'ethpow', '0802', 'ethso', 'yeah', 'big', 'upside']"

371065,the guy asked what happens if you get liquidated when you borrow eth and dont sell it you can because the protocol sees eth going up in price and eating your collateral but in reality since you still have the eth you can always return it and not lose money,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'guy', 'asked', 'happens', 'liquidated', 'borrow', 'eth', 'nt', 'sell', 'protocol', 'sees', 'eth', 'going', 'price', 'eating', 'collateral', 'reality', 'eth', 'return', 'lose', 'money']"
371066,my smol dont understand why alfa isnt to just buy and hold eth to get ethpow instead of complicated borrowing operations pls explain simply i retard,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371067,but returning eth defeats the whole purpose,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371069,you bear and afraid eth dumps between now and merge but you wanna get free fork money anywayyou do this borrow thing so that you have eth without caring if it dumps,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'bear', 'afraid', 'eth', 'dumps', 'merge', 'wanna', 'free', 'fork', 'money', 'anywayyou', 'borrow', 'thing', 'eth', 'caring', 'dumps']"
371071,so this position is a hedge from eth dumping post merge meanwhile getting free ethpow,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371073,you can because the protocol sees eth going up in price and eating your collateral whats this referring to,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371075,yeah its just to hedge eth you can also use this trick to join shitcoin farms,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371079,protocol doesnt know you still have the eth in the wallet so it treats it as a normal eth short,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'protocol', 'nt', 'know', 'eth', 'wallet', 'treats', 'normal', 'eth', 'short']"
371080,or youre referring to the merge play yeah its only for the eth side on the fork chain your position will prob get insta liquidated cause usdfork is worth 0 so you lose the hedge but keep the ethw,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371085,i think its because youre thinking about going long on eth ie supply it to the protocol if you supply stables and borrow eth you cant get liquidated if it dumps so its all gucci,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'think', 'thinking', 'going', 'long', 'eth', 'ie', 'supply', 'protocol', 'supply', 'stables', 'borrow', 'eth', 'nt', 'liquidated', 'dumps', 'gucci']"

371137,with the whole eth pow vs pos drama im curious how an immutable stable like liquidity will handle that if theres a fork itll exist twice liquidity only uses eth as collateral so theoretically they could just fork the entire tvl and have it exist twice im guessing that there would be massive liquidations on the chain thats not the real eth since price would probably dump,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'eth', 'pow', 'vs', 'pos', 'drama', 'm', 'curious', 'immutable', 'stable', 'like', 'liquidity', 'handle', 's', 'fork', 'll', 'exist', 'twice', 'liquidity', 'uses', 'eth', 'collateral', 'theoretically', 'fork', 'entire', 'tvl', 'exist', 'twice', 'm', 'guessing', 'massive', 'liquidations', 'chain', 's', 'real', 'eth', 'price', 'probably', 'dump']"

371152,oh i very much care in the sense that i think itll be an absolutely fascinating case study in what happens if usdc and usdt suddenly cease to work be backed will be interesting to see how liquidity reacts and how fast price nukes because of it good to know if theres ever a large scale black swan event in a centralized stable,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'tether', 'usdt', 'oh', 'care', 'sense', 'think', 'll', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'case', 'study', 'happens', 'usdc', 'usdt', 'suddenly', 'cease', 'work', 'backed', 'interesting', 'liquidity', 'reacts', 'fast', 'price', 'nukes', 'good', 'know', 's', 'large', 'scale', 'black', 'swan', 'event', 'centralized', 'stable']"

371237,i should point out that longtail isnt eulers target market it was more a design philosophy about building secure permissionless systems other protocols especially compound rely on the devsgovernance knowing which markets can be safely activated or not if they dont study the tokens properly then bad things happen hence why a majority of compound forks are now rekt the reentrant tokens always found a way to confound the devs in charge our thinking was that if you build a protocol designed to handle longtail exotic assets by default then you dont need devs who know the insandouts in charge of listing if you assume that tokens will be listed that are hostile or that have weird balanceof functions and reentrancy and fee on transfer and so on then it increases composability of the protocol and security overall that was the philosophy,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"

371495,inb4 market days announcing seizure by fbi etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

371567,but using tornado with eth should never be a problem correct me if im wrong,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371604,i agree and disagree they chose sanctions to kill off a defi project low blow you cant fight that but imho they didnt do it because privacy bad its only for hackers etc they had a political reason that we could soon discover,"['decentralized finance', 'defi', 'ethereum classic', 'etc', 'agree', 'disagree', 'chose', 'sanctions', 'kill', 'defi', 'project', 'low', 'blow', 'nt', 'fight', 'imho', 'nt', 'privacy', 'bad', 'hackers', 'etc', 'political', 'reason', 'soon', 'discover']"

371933,im arguing that people with traces of stained eth are irrelevant for the police and youre equating it with a guy personally giving instructions to north korea on how to evade sanctions,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371934,im not saying opsec good practices respecting the law where you live at least in paper etc etc arent important things what im saying is that they like fear porn like 10 years ago bitcoin was to buy drugs and hire hitmen and if you bought bitcoin they would go after you and all the similar narratives dont use defi there is no kyc so we cant protect you from interacting with nk haxxorz,"['ethereum classic', 'etc', 'ethereum classic', 'etc', 'decentralized finance', 'defi', 'know your customer', 'kyc', 'm', 'saying', 'opsec', 'good', 'practices', 'respecting', 'law', 'live', 'paper', 'etc', 'etc', 'nt', 'important', 'things', 'm', 'saying', 'like', 'fear', 'porn', 'like', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'bitcoin', 'buy', 'drugs', 'hire', 'hitmen', 'bought', 'bitcoin', 'similar', 'narratives', 'nt', 'use', 'defi', 'kyc', 'nt', 'protect', 'interacting', 'nk', 'haxxorz']"

371948,yeah the code works othersame devs are free to copypaste with non sanctioned contracts they can even try to launder the sanctioned eth there,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
371952,so sure you could use it but now youll have a lot of pushback and increase unnecessary risks the likelihood of being affected frozen assets legal issues etc have significantly increased,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
371953,yeah 100 agree with your statement but what im also saying is that if someone usa in this case doesnt accept coins doesnt mean everyone has to dance around necessarily because maybe there will be people wanting to make a statement in the contrary as in you cant tell me what to code or not etc etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc', 'ethereum classic', 'etc', 'yeah', '100', 'agree', 'statement', 'm', 'saying', 'usa', 'case', 'nt', 'accept', 'coins', 'nt', 'mean', 'dance', 'necessarily', 'maybe', 'people', 'wanting', 'statement', 'contrary', 'nt', 'tell', 'code', 'etc', 'etc']"
371954,neither its the same pretending to substitute the financial system with a malfunctioning code that doesnt work and nobody develops in it than with the current state of things around crypto nowadays if you build a global non kyc system you cant stop it because you may interact with unbanked people or better said you should have known from the very beginning that it would happen,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"

372120,but that also wasnt my point my point is that it wasnt as easy as just blacklisting 1 address that only frax controls it is unlikely but it can happen yes but our structural holding of usdc is different than makers for example which is entirely in psm contracts,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
372121,i get your point but since addresses are not formally owned by entities like bank accounts are it really doesnt matter from the ofacs point of view if frax is sanctioned usdc may be compelled to blacklist a wide scope not narrow one we are in uncharted territory here but we knew this day would come its high time we prepare for the next one,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
372131,they dont have to blacklist the uniswap pool they can blacklist you depositing address then the usdc will stay there forever so what you said about having to blacklist others as well is not correct,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
372137,well not exactly ofac can blacklist anything true but that doesnt affect onchain usdc on the other hand does so saying its unlikely usdc blocks public pools is a bit of a stretch since its beyond their control were not in kansas anymore sadly,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'exactly', 'ofac', 'blacklist', 'true', 'nt', 'affect', 'onchain', 'usdc', 'hand', 'saying', 'unlikely', 'usdc', 'blocks', 'public', 'pools', 'bit', 'stretch', 'control', 'kansas', 'anymore', 'sadly']"
372146,sure but thats not a problem theres a timelock and dao upgrade policy to withdraw from a new address the only way to actually get the usdc frozen is either hit it permanently in a contract that frax dao has at the time of blacklisting or it wont be effective,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"

372213,lusd is just rekt,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
372282,k cool still doesnt change the fact that if lusd had a fake dao it would not be entirely rekt if chainlink updated their contracts to remove them but great point i guess,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
372296,not sure what youre talking about you can literally go to both appfraxfinance or daistatscom and get a real time transparent view of how much frax and dai are fiat wrapped but it took 20 minutes of arguing here for you to admit lusd is a chainlink pretendao so we should call it even i guess,"['conventional government-issued currency (e.g. us dollar, euro)', 'fiat']"
372318,might as well do that and also let usdc holders vote too right,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
372321,throw in eth too,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
372322,ive seen the presentation theyve given live at the oracle summit in berlin and the exact same questions where asked there their answer was they cant change anything and are beyond rekt if their oracles failchange its an active choice they made you still have them running around on twitter and pretending to be the more decentralised dai and retweeting shit of people that pretend that while being at the full mercy of a 49 multisig with no way to ever potentially overcome that hurdle,"['“wrecked” (meaning major losses)', 'rekt']"
372324,kek at that honestly anything using a glorified multisig and calling itself decentralised is a farce that kinda goes out to all of defi,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
372331,so would you say our biggest risk for decentralized stables may be oracles can we not create a purely on chain dataset for 1 all eth stable or eth wbtc swap values can allow us to derive the value of 1 from that rough draft of how system could work could cut out price feeds from off chain sources and create an immutable on chain unit of accounting where data sets can always derive values from,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth', 'biggest', 'risk', 'decentralized', 'stables', 'oracles', 'create', 'purely', 'chain', 'dataset', '1', 'eth', 'stable', 'eth', 'wbtc', 'swap', 'values', 'allow', 'derive', 'value', '1', 'rough', 'draft', 'system', 'work', 'cut', 'price', 'feeds', 'chain', 'sources', 'create', 'immutable', 'chain', 'unit', 'accounting', 'data', 'sets', 'derive', 'values']"
372335,its for many reasons not just the volatility of eth but all you need to know is that every stablecoin built only with the overcollateralized asset model is only a fraction of a fraction of either dai or fraxs mcap this is not a coincidence you should take this real world data to heart it is clearly illustrating a point lusdfeisusdrai all combined dont even reach 800m market cap although i love all of them each of their individual unique innovations is something to learn from and their teams are world class but they are all incredibly small were not trying to build a stablecoin for ants it simply is not going to grow past a certain size by using those models crypto does not have any evidence of a single overcollateralizedonly stablecoin that grows in size rather than shrinks over time,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
372354,overall i feel like contract approvals used to be a necessary evil for proper ux but these days more thought should be put into it for example an eip that would allow for data with token transfers,"['ethereum improvement proposal', 'eip']"
372368,most arent ignoring the issues associated with smaller stables we know theyre small and are difficult to scale theyre issues not projectending risks thoughchallenge with the usdc wrappers is that yes they can scale but at what costs to decentralization and censorshipresistance so i think asking those questions are good especially given the threat of centralization to the trust people have placed in these assets,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
372381,well yeah i mean its tokenbased governance where voters expect that tokens they used to vote for dao decisions appreciate in price or at least dont fall much if they dont comply with regulation they are taking risk of significant price drop delisting from centralized exchanges being cut from centralized stablecoins etc or simply cut off from most popular wallets and rpc providers daos in fact arent made for rebels against the state,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

373151,i can guarantee you that the other devs will remember this anyway tornado is ofc a special snowflake and every other defi protocol literally cannot be used for money laundering but this sets a very poor precedent for inevitable attempts at a generalized crackdown later,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
373153,the message is simple compliance will be rewarded defiance will be tolerated but for a time defi is dead long live comfi hyperbole maybe hopefully,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
373157,i think defi will turn from regulatory arbitrage wild west to a boring fintech backend,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
373168,metacoin is right on this one banningarresting creators of a mixer is still different than arresting the founder of an a16z backed startup its one step further than banning actual operators of mixers but no reason to say theres suddenly open season on defi devs,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
373178,the narrative of banks bad is one that has seeped very aggressively into western culture for the past decade or two so painting defi at the fulcrum of a populist coalition of antiestablishment right and left wingers wont be a hard sell,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
373191,can i buy a lobster with eth pow,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
373202,so poweth is a chance to rebuild a fully decentralized ecosystem that rids itself of the poison pill of usdc,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
373252,btw collar ratio went up 10 and wbtc part changed from 37 to 41 was it just price flucation or makers is starting to implement usdc hedge to wbtc,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc']"
373260,i assume etherscan will soon start sending this data for direct contract calls and then what at this point defi and nfts become too difficult for an average bayc bullish,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
373264,for quite a while actually for newcomers guni tokens are liquidity pools that are connected to usdc by common liquidity pairs so circle co have quite a lot of power to render dai useless in an instant counterintuitively so if you have lets say 10k usdc on your wallet the probability that your particular wallet out of millions of other wallets will be frozen might be perceived as lesser than the probability of freezing single collateral of makerdao but thats merely a current state of dai not a design limit so they can change it in theory,"['usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'usd coin (stablecoin)', 'usdc', 'actually', 'newcomers', 'guni', 'tokens', 'liquidity', 'pools', 'connected', 'usdc', 'common', 'liquidity', 'pairs', 'circle', 'co', 'lot', 'power', 'render', 'dai', 'useless', 'instant', 'counterintuitively', 'lets', '10k', 'usdc', 'wallet', 'probability', 'particular', 'wallet', 'millions', 'wallets', 'frozen', 'perceived', 'lesser', 'probability', 'freezing', 'single', 'collateral', 'makerdao', 's', 'merely', 'current', 'state', 'dai', 'design', 'limit', 'change', 'theory']"
373269,probably shouldve taken a hint when they introduced kyc after cozying with institutions but onwards,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
373277,youre saying everyone who touched tornado are currently blacklisted by virtually all of major defi seems like a stretch,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
373285,anyway gotta tornado some and check for myself ig,"['technical analysis or trend analysis', 'ta']"
373296,yeah we gotta see how it works in practice ie if anyones addresses on here are actually blacklisted for merely using tc or not,"['technical analysis or trend analysis', 'ta']"
373325,then metamask will implement kyc verification unfortunately it was predictable 1year ago after uniswap banned some derivatives tokens,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"
373332,unfortunarely this doesnt work that way use smartcontract as we tell you blockchain is either censorship resistant or there are some entitiespeople who can censor usage of it same with blochcain primitives such as dexes oracles infra like rpc ipfs gateways etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
373347,target individual dao members that run the oracle unit pretty public proposal after all imagine that price oracles works as dao members can commit price and result calcs as their stake consensus focal point with reward etc the concern that bad actors can come after the dao members who commit the prices and compromise enough of them to render oracle useless i argue that internet access via tor and wallet owenershipfunding via tornado should mitigate this issue a few year ago i had some thought on that page 9 wp is long deprecated dont use it shouldnt be still true today,"['ethereum classic', 'etc', 'the onion router (one who sends anonymous data)', 'tor', 'target', 'individual', 'dao', 'members', 'run', 'oracle', 'unit', 'pretty', 'public', 'proposal', 'imagine', 'price', 'oracles', 'works', 'dao', 'members', 'commit', 'price', 'result', 'calcs', 'stake', 'consensus', 'focal', 'point', 'reward', 'etc', 'concern', 'bad', 'actors', 'come', 'dao', 'members', 'commit', 'prices', 'compromise', 'render', 'oracle', 'useless', 'argue', 'internet', 'access', 'tor', 'wallet', 'owenershipfunding', 'tornado', 'mitigate', 'issue', 'year', 'ago', 'thought', 'page', '9', 'wp', 'long', 'deprecated', 'nt', 'use', 'nt', 'true', 'today']"

373401,ahh those 01 eth addresses,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
373429,not sure if this is a long shot or a stupid question but are you guys aware where websites like dove metrics before acquired crunchbase crypto weekly etc get their information regarding vc funding some say theyre all hand pickedi assume theyre getting information from certain news sources that cover crypto funding whom have connections to the vcs and then run scripts on said news source that automatically can add that to their site and have an employee review it this is my guess does anyone else have a better one or know the answer,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
373430,but probably there is something wrong because doesnt sound rational to block cases like the dust transfers ofc i dont really know first hand about that as i have no big access to the aave ui repo or any api,"['application programming interface', 'api']"
373441,send them 01 eth and find out,"['ether (also known as ethereum)', 'eth']"
373442,not a rollup but railgun is building privacy infra that uses zksnarks to allow private txs by way of 0zk addresses in onchain dark pools this means arbitrary smart contract calls against a private balance without the need of rollups l2 etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"

373824,well practically without tornado and without pow mining all defi will be kycd,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
373909,vcs fund projects with one hand and fund kyc startups with another one massively diluting the value proposition with their shitty advice they dont give a shit about decentralization never look at what vcpoisoned projects say look at their actionsthe excess profits from double dipping in both equity and dumping on retail go to bribe the regulators so they can become the new incumbents the regulatory moat the are building behind closed doors would never allow a hobbyist dev to participatethe exact same play has unfolded so many times before with gambling and social media for example,"['know your customer', 'kyc']"

373968,etherscan api has it for erc20 and erc721 pro endpoint,"['application programming interface', 'api']"
373983,maybe we need like an audit transparency google sheet like the one about compensation transparency that was floating about it would have lines of code cost time etc,"['ethereum classic', 'etc']"
374010,well its fluid in the sense that lines of code are not the only parameter we used to estimate the effort needed to produce a meaningful audit report loc is a really basic rule of thumb here usually defi projects are much more complex than nft projects and it does not necessarily reflected in the number of lines,"['decentralized finance', 'defi']"
