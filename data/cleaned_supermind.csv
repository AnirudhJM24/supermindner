id,content
321712,hey we re using our botand also filtering such recommendations to select only topics worth attention5 people are in duty every day
321713,good stuff i am surprised i took so long to find this community lol
321717,you are using a nonofficial one
321718,use the one that uniswap uses
321719,keep in mind this is a hot subgraph so it can change anytime without notice
321720,
321721,voting with money is beyond dumb the fact someone has 100x money doesnt mean they have 100x better judgement on the contrary after some point they are probably checked out and too busy chilling
321722,nan
321723,
321724,r u adjusting the gov model then
321725,we are just not voting often and delegating to people who know their shit
321726,quadratic voting solves this but needs somehow verify identity of holder
321727,hope
321728,you guys never have to deal with any of this
321729,
321730,and never submit your vision your project all the best
321731,ouch
321732,id argue reality is a downwards diagonal even too kind with the bell curve
321733,idk do you think small traders sit on governance forums i think its accurate if you think of it as a mental model
321734,i dont wanna pay 400 gas fee to vote
321735,imo most active users doing couch governance on rocket back in the day yes forums is a mix not sure these days tbh
321736,most of votes are on snapshot sir no gas fees at all
321737,im kinda exagerating tho agree its a good mental model
321738,thanks
321739,thanks i guess i could also deploy the contract to the chains i want
321740,
321741,ricburtons you invested in me 20
321742,is the token srsly called lfg jfc
321743,why

321762,good one
321763,anyone uses svelte for web3 stuff how is the experience should i just give up svelte and learn react
321764,yea ive exclusively been using svelte and esp sveltekit for dapps the past couple years and cant even think about using something else you can ship sooo fast once you get the hang of it
321765,also if anyone has any balance qs u can hit me up im a core contrib there
321766,yeah i am a fan of svelte just everything in web3 seems to revolve around react so was a bit concerned if svelte is supported at all
321767,but glad to know it is
321768,nan
321769,anyone know where to stake this
321770,for additional yield that is
321771,svelte is so fantastic we do everything in it
321772,i never even learned react was that easyevery react dev i show it to falls in love
321773,i have converted my entire team to it
321774,it makes frontend fun for sure
321775,i usually hate frontend work like even css turns me off
321776,i used to do react but havent looked back since 2019ish
321777,same more than frontend work i hate the ceremony around most frontend stuff
321779,so happy to hear it made me love front end i only know of like 3 other teams that use svelte
321780,yea just use the svelteweb3 library
321781,theres a web3 library
321782,this is news
321783,several but all the others are broken or outdated
321784,weve been doing it with just javascript and walletconnect
321785,will have to check that out
321786,you invested in icons
321787,something bernie madoff would say
321788,ric also said in the latest investor update please if you are considering suing me you can go fuck yourself
321789,honestly people like this just reflect so badly on all the real builders out there
321790,you backed me learning to surf not balance
321791,what hes gonna do cliffs on both sides hes not gonna paddle to new zealand
321792,be safe out there lobsters though most here have sense to keep your assets safe
321793,is it sarcasm cant tell
321794,surfing picture incoming
321795,is joke sir im giga code retard
321796,
321797,personally im loving svelte capfinance is also written in svelte its pretty smooth responsive and lite you can check the source here
321800,i saw everyone tweeting this but im missing origin of the meme lol
321801,maybe this one
321802,hmm
321808,how can they actually sell this
321809,otc only
321810,yeah but who wants btc that nobody will take
321811,
321812,he could do this
321816,
321817,any known gotchas using vue2 and web3 stuff
321818,i wonder if they can wrap it
321819,renbtc is usually a culprit
321820,ivangbi pls check dm
321821,
321822,can they just make a token already please
321823,i am joking ik there is zrx
321824,jurys still out for traderxyz thothey might do smth later on esp as they got a big grant from 0x dao around 1m
321827,hi admin ivangbi pls dont ban me sir
321828,there is so people like you can post without fear of getting banned
321829,it was a joke i had shared with him already but agree
321830,nice update in the gearbox announcements thank you ser ivangbi
321831,
321832,
321833,tornado
321834,any guess what hes next handle will be
321836,btw is tornado cash really that safe in term of privacy fund really cant be tracked
321837,8k in eth withdrawal should be noticeable even if split across a few wallets
321838,splitting in hundred wallets around half a year nobody will notice i think
321839,reasonably safe if done correctly if you are impatient or pull out as much as you put in its obvioustheres some deniability which is nice but its nothing like privacy first tech aztec secret etc
321840,you can do some probability stuff but its all guess work the protocol itself ensures 100 privacy
321841,insane that this guys built generational wealth by scamming people like that
321842,on which testnet can i get like a thousand eth easy
321843,one you start locally
321844,haha except that should have added that i want it to be publicly available
321845,what can u do with tainted coins dont get it
321846,check decommasio multisender
321847,good question
321848,in case of an investigation by the irs i am just hypothesizing and condone anyone who does this and i am not even sure this method would work dont do this no sarcasm1 you supposedly anonymously create a shitcoin call it time and buy it from your actual clean wallet worth 10k usd only at the start2 you proceed buy it then from the dirty wallets create volumes make a community do bribes etc that all creates legitimacy around the coin3 along the way people buy and sell so you might be buying someone elses bags and as such you should consider it as an expense like 10 for washing and ofc you can stop buying at any pointthis is much harder to do than you think you need more legitimacy around the project but this is the tldr option you might end up losing too much in this case but this is one of the options in the growing market you can even make more this way than the notional you had
321849,isnt it easier with some lowquality bluecryptoshark nft project
321850,yes but if you 100x an nft with no market except for your bots there is no chance in hell a competent bank will accept those funds
321851,and also opensea takes 25 default so washing is not cheap at all and if you do it on some ownself created marketplace and 0 opensea colume its clearly fake
321852,instructions unclear launching an looksrare fork nft project
321853,this is just a continuation of cex world pre 2017 all the chinese exchanges had billions of fake volume when coinbase had 20 mm
321854,volumes advertising eyeballs
321855,chinese exchanges still have billions in volumes
321857,thanks mate have you used it
321858,if used any feedback would be awesome
321859,i might be too naive but are banks that competent ie to raise a flag of hey that nft project looks like bought only by bots on os
321860,banks will just ask you for a proof of funds and if they dont like it reject you the irs might become a bigger issue with those kind of things once they take an actual interest in you they are very capable of finding out everything same goes for law enforcement if they determine you are worth it they will get you in general those tricks get harder to pull of the more money is at play
321861,agree you are signing a sentence if you present that record and pretend its gonna be okay your call but i personally and many here do not condone crimes we do not committ them or endorse them in any way no sarcasm do not do fraud and make sure to pay your taxes
321862,anyway legal couch advice again lets end it we are just speculating on what sifu could be doing but thats not a safe discussion to be having
321863,i do not endorse it at all neither im just curious to know to what extend those actors banks irs linkedin recruiters have adapted because well its just another side of adoption i pay my tax ser and everyone should fraud is ev on the long run
321864,for all we know sifu could be raising funds to search for the next dragon warrior
321865,in the same multisig with raiden
321866,what of tornado is now sifus
321868,its not a sifu discussion one might say
321869,total now is around 150k eth so prob around 5
321870,and this is why your kids hate you
321871,jesus sifu lol
321872,tornadoing the money now
321873,thanks idk the math curious at what point x major depositors become a statistical worry but i assume its close to impossible to dissect it all
321875,500 unique users per week46k eth withdrawals per month 115 per weekso withdrawals above 45 eth 2x avg per week might trigger some pointers i presume
321876,who is raiden
321877,sifu tornado 150k eth
321878,150k
321879,total in tornado
321880,
321882,nothing happens in crypto though
321883,some say his life is in danger
321884,when the whole sisyphus0x thing happened they said beerus life was in danger as well
321885,nothing happened
321886,crypto is scammers paradise
321887,
321893,i wonder if someone is even following what happened after the formal complaint was said to be registered
321899,couch legal advice again redacted all some of you need counsel and it shows all of it legal tax and a psychiatrist
321900,if anyone knows a generalist whos good at counselling all 3 at once lmk
321901,yes i tried to deposit funds from the sale of an ape i minted into a crypto native bank and they rejected it citing a lack of kyc on opensea now imagine showing them a project where you are the only one profiting maybe a bank less familiar with crypto wouldnt think about these things who knows
321902,ivangbi blz delete if too armchair
321903,nah this is relevant cause u r not larp u r loaded so it counts as fine feedback
321904,try depositing dsd and claim its 1 and blame the bank if they say is not true
321905,ill tell them to use my oracle it reads rock solid at 1
321906,also im definitely a larp how dare you
321907,if solana ok than everything working smoothly anyway you can ask all the questions in their tg chat
321908,nan

321912,daniele introducing the 1 person multisig
321913,shifting toward cdo centralized dependent organisation did he explain what he meant no more voteultimo leader style hes the only allowed to create proposal nothing change really in the gov process thats just some bluff
321914,some people just want to follow a leader like those people who voted no on the liquidation
321915,cool thanks a lot
321916,meanwhile ondo dreams of sushi from ondos discord
321922,daniele associates oligarchy
321925,more respectable title
321926,
321927,
321928,is he trying to say that he is paying his partner in crime privately
321929,comeon he needs some privacy
321931,
321932,sounds complex
321933,didnt they slash ppls vesting for not checking their forums for a few weeks too long or something
321934,sifu replied to me lol
321935,hey guys i am having an open discussion with adtiya from derivadex right now on zoom feel free to hop on if interested about derivatives and hardware innovations in defi
321936,why not twitter space
321937,lmao did you see the reply
321938,testing smething
321939,hardware in defi
321940,lol ill explain shortly
321941,ivangbi pls check dm ser
321942,
321943,
321944,new market review by glassnode released
321945,weird to see matthew effect causing centralization in an inherently and intentionally decentralized spacebut then its to be expected
321947,so this triple felon takes all these funds from the time treasury sells washes them onchain from his ens wallet still is active on twitter and no one is doing shit
321948,what do you want people to do
321949,wanted to keep a small close knit group to avoid pleb talk with random generic crowd
321950,but think twitter spaces is the way to go going forward
321952,another big twitch streamer scammed 700k with a bsc doge fork not looking good
321954,source
321955,i remember it differently so maybe admins will delete both of ours posts to not start unnecessary drama
321956,
321957,thankswondering whats the scale of such scams apart from crypto
321958,if anyone has boosts for discord servers could you please boost the freeassangedao server we are in need of 3 more to get an immutable link discord 7 day expirary links are dumb af
321959,also feel free to join we are in the process of setting up a juicebox to donate eth in exchange for the justice token which will govern the dao and be eligible for fractionaliztion for the jullian assange x pak nft collaboration all proceeds raised will be used to fund legal fees for julian assange in his us extradition case
321960,avalanche ethereum bridge
321961,what is the best voting protocol best tech currently
321962,love this im a juicebox contributor feel free to ping me or anyone in our discord i think youre already in there right
321963,
321964,yeah love snapshot but i mean something like votium
321965,he didnt have a problem with it when he wasnt doxxed lol put a name to it and now transparency is an issue
321966,votium is not a voting protocol please be more specific then
321967,how would you call a protocol like votium
321968,excellent
321969,also interested in this and if any exists offering more complex features such as proof of token ownership on a time interval say you want to prove to someone you were holding the tokens for the 1000 consecutive blocks
321970,bribing for voting power i mean voting is a broad term
321971,check out from me aragon
321972,
321973,
321974,not that much competition yet
321975,this the one with aave grant
321976,you can use graph queries for snapshots tally not yet shipped iirc and zodiac looks pretty cool too
321977,do graph queries work onchain
321978,i have tried and failed to understand the graph more times than i care to admit to
321979,you mean bribe havent looked into it but there is only votium and votemak left besides that we will see if this is a winner takes it all sector
321981,
321982,so basically i want to not only query for the balances at blocka and balances at blockb edge points of the interval and for this i could use merkle trees to have a provable balances accepted by the smart contractsbut i want the whole interval in between to also meet the condition of wallet x having token y balance always zofcourse i could build the merkle tree for every block inbetween but that seems like a hugely inefficient and maybe even impossible solution if this range gets too big and then smart contract cant iterate when verifying since its limited by gas
321983,snapshot and its not even close
321984,and for vote bribing
321985,votium has pmf on convex anything else doesnt work votemak did once for core events
321986,pmf
321987,voter extractable value sounds interesting no idea if this concept has a chance though
321988,muditg what is your connection to bribe
321989,becomes increasingly decentralized and trustless is that going to be possible
321990,i am an honest man i dont take bribes
321991,
321992,re bribexyz i did a peer review of their codebase
321993,already done
321994,yea did it a couple of weeks ago
321995,ok thx then its not updated in the docs
321996,well im not doing an audit just a peer review of the code guess they need to update their wording a little
321997,maybe a query excluding address existing in transfer events in the interval i by no mean am a graph expert but should be doable with an appropriate subgraph no
321998,code quality good or bad ser
321999,it was good
322000,good to know
322001,anyway i hope the mm wont suck eventually
322002,in 20 min at the top of the hour scbuergel is going take a break from shitposting in lobster chat to come talk about metadata collection and leakage in defi weve collected all of your ips paired them to your eth addresses and are forwarding them to the irs if you dont come and join
322003,hi gang
322004,im new here but ive been working on a smart contract recently for an nft project and i have a weird opensea bug where one nft per tx isnt showing on my testnet opensea seems to be the only issue with contract was wondering if theres anyone who could maybe help me out or point me in the right direction
322005,im probably the worst person to ask im their competitor and we have 20x their tvl
322006,pmf product market fit
322007,20x tvl of convex
322008,bribe vev is their thing
322009,convex has the monopoly on curve lping up to you to decide whether or not its a good thing
322010,but not currently aave vs curve
322012,am i seeing this correctly
322014,what
322016,the block reward for the miner
322017,hes paid that
322018,static reward tx fees
322019,i guess theyre just choosing the right txes
322020,yeah seems like theres an nft sale so lots of people are paying 12 eth in tips for priority
322021,
322022,you can see lots of these are way overpaying
322023,yea was the gucci nft drop
322024,gucci is expensive
322025,did he just get lucky to mine that block
322026,sorry i know nothing about mining
322027,yes
322028,well its not an individual its a mining pool but yeah they were lucky to create that exact block
322038,not sure how they counted it looks like an amount of cardtocard transfers or so meaningless they recently less then 3 weeks ago tmecp0xrss4375 bought a crystallblockchain soft for the ministry of internal affairs btw impossible to get all data even with using for such short period of time
322040,so basically anyone who used vpn via russian proxy counted chinese pakistan or even iran usersor they know everyone who used binance now
322041,if you havent leaked the data to them then everything is fine
322042,i have a hard time imagining why someone would use such proxy
322044,redacted the majority yellow press horse shit kept some good replies
322046,youtube defi rug anything finance youtube run redacted the message but if you wanna learn the basics finematics and whiteboard crypto make decent videos wo inherent shilling
322047,
322078,
322079,top is near
322080,or is it dare i say mass adoption
322081,the ticketing makes sense as an nft the other stuff is obvious cash grab
322082,can move this to nft avenue if it gets too nft focusedi guess it depends on what you think mass adoption looks like each one of these nft collections has around 10k items so if you assume around the same audience for each one its not that many people playing around
322083,does anyone have analytics on how much overlap in ownership there is among high volume nft projects
322084,in terms of reaching public consciousness though definitely seems undeniable
322085,this is actually useful
322086,
322087,
322088,thx ill try to attend

322095,149 is not cheap is it worth this price
322096,
322097,pretty cool stuff and simple
322098,i feel like the discrete rebase was def not ideal bc it could get gamed via strays like the above
322099,i g ohm v1 as the first mover had a lot of forks off the original codebasewhich is very gross btw ohm v2 is significantly cleanera bit of a pity we didnt get continuous reward vesting stuff from the get go
322102,gn lobs fam i have a pretty dumb question i guesswhy do nft projects utilize arweave rather than filecoinipfs what are the pros except for that permanent storage narrative and problems with zero incentivization for data retrievement in filecoin may be toolingusability pls help dumb seafood to become smarter
322109,hard to find stuff on ipfs
322110,i have seen more projects utilising ipfs than i have seen arweave tbh
322111,
322112,
322113,methinks someone is going to find themselves in need of a license or two with those plans
322114,i love how the sushirelaymanifold crowd is always trying to get validation in sushi posts calls and updates i seriously wonder if theyre gmi
322116,stablecoins growth potential and impact on bankingarticle comments
322117,dumb question but how would i figure out what types of collateral have been liquidated during a market downturn for example were most liquidated loans backed by eth or some other asset or a basket of assets on makercompoundaave
322118,is there a dune dash for this
322119,from3adefialertssrctyped_queryflive
322120,that will get you started
322121,looked a bit into this on aave
322122,woah this is dope kudos
322123,i ask because im wondering if there is a way to build a portfolio of assets to borrow against that is resistant to huge market downturns in eth and btc but also still has some upside
322124,some combination of var and asset correlation that could help ppl lever up more responsibly lol
322125,i believe on both compoud and aave you can borrow against multiple assets
322126,but maybe ppl already do this and im just behind what do i know
322127,wasnt their problem leadership and hr seems odd to not address the core issue
322128,
322129,
322130,really chad simple
322131,the whole point of wonderland was his fatness lord dani le frog was better than a dao that turned out to be a lie throw it in the trash
322132,oh look its nour trying to profit from another protocol again
322133,check parsec it has decent dashboards for liquidations
322134,yeah parsec really fkin good
322135,can second this parsec is the best
322136,awesome thanks guys
322137,any thoughts on my idea though id rather not pursue it if its dumb lol
322138,i will take silence as a that is a dumb idea
322139,lf you are interested in var have a look at some of nassim talebs reasoning why it sucks i know that he is a nocoiner but he has been proven right many times on tail risks
322140,especially this part
322141,i see
322142,imo frogs are still happy with dani managing wonderland despite everything id be surprised if your proposal went anywhere
322143,i dont think hes trying to profit at all i would argue hes actually calling for sensible action considering the suspicious circumstances around the entire situation this can and will be used against the entire sector
322144,yeah the guy who uses every single popular defi drama for his own self promotion is not trying to be opportunistic here once again he just cares for the poor frogs
322145,sweet summer child
322146,putting aside the writer of the proposal its not a bad idea at least that way funds are sifu
322147,go gearbox
322148,a welloiled machine gearbox has proven itself to be one of todays leaders in process quality with a score of 88 having entrusted complete smart contract ownership to its dao the protocol clearly demonstrates a will to establish deep foundations of trust within its community paired with indepth testing suites software documentation and rigorous audits gearbox leaves almost no room for improvementin the future we recommend that gearbox look into getting a formal verification and also expanding on their testing documentation with code coverage full score 88
322149,is it youll still need ppl to run things he calls them elected delegates whales a la dani can vote himself a delegate so how does this proposal solve anything a fully community run project would die a horrible flaming death
322150,honestly prob just best to dissolve the treasury and disperse to holders pro rata at this point dont really see how this resolves itself equitably
322152,when did we discuss with him was searching for his comments but didnt find any was it about the sniping of the initial time lp or something else
322153,it was hereabouts
322154,
322155,if someone was on bsc toofarm it got rugged 2h ago
322156,owen just wanted to point out that utility for sudoswap can be greatly enhanced with emblem vaults native btc can be traded and native coins from numerous other chains are supported as well plus their nfts with emblem vaults the wallet itself is traded the assets inside the wallet never move a good way to keep trades private
322157,can you link some documentation emblem vaults sound likenft keyed smart contract wallets
322158,
322160,whales can move huge sums privately this way nothing shows up on the blockchain for the assets held within the vault
322161,since sudoswap supports private otc trades it is perfect for large scale otc trading of native bitcoin and other native coins using ethereum as the network
322162,how are assets stored cross chain tried to look at medium and the site but i couldnt find infodo we need to add anything to support the vaults or are they alrdy erc721 or 1155 compliant
322163,u need to do nothing really
322164,check dm
322167,elected delegates still have to go through days of onchain voting proposal execution timelock all of their actions need to be passed as transparent onchain proposals that they can be held accountable to instead of an obscure multisig weve been doing this for a year in inverse projects such as maker as well and id say theyre not exactly dying a horrible flaming death
322168,this didnt last very long
322169,never been part of any defi dramas not to mention profited this particular situation matters to me a lot because practices of the frog nation go against everything i believe in honesty
322170,i mentioned lack of governance and transparency in danieles projects months ago i always criticized multisigrun daos in general this is not exactly a new opinion
322171,then let it die and let those that supported it learn a hard lesson
322172,even from a purely selfish stance i dont think thats a good idea wonderland story will be remembered for a long time imo at least some serious attempt of selfregulation by the end of that story would be doing all of us a great favor imo
322173,remembered for a long timesurely you must be joking
322174,nan
322175,not referring to crypto memory but rather to regulators politicians media
322177,i reckon they have more interesting things to remember
322178,i agree 6 months from now a new wonderland will pop up and another bunch of crypto newcomers will get rekt for good and never come back we can do better than just leave it
322179,plenty of people were sounding the alarm on danishit the last several months even before the sifu reveal there were serious problems with treasury raiding for salary and the public twitter spats which were basically blackmail attempts no one said shit most of cryptotwitter praised him
322180,kind of silly everyone all of a sudden cares now
322181,no one cares when numba go up fundamentals quickly change when numba go down
322182,agree i think nour is right decentralisation does not mean no self regulation if we do not self regulate and fail to regulate ourselves and exercise stadnards state actors will chew us up
322183,memory of a goldfish is correct nourharidy youre wasting your time when we got rugged on anubis by sisyphus and co everyone cared for a week then some new drama happened and everyone moved on the guys didnt even take a hit to their reputations
322184,all youve done since the news came out is shit on abracadabra while promoting your shitty stable coin here people can make their own opinions its a free market
322185,no need to be rude like that
322186,i know my bad but it was really obvious for the past few days a lot of passive shilling with aggressive vibes vs other projects
322187,and he even made a new project keeek
322188,not other projects only frog nation which now clearly deserve it never been aggressive against any other project be fair
322189,frax fei maker alchemix and many others are honest hard working stablecoin projects and deserve respect
322190,mim is a pretty good idea tho
322191,its a stable coin all that matters is the peg personal issues are irrelevant if they restore the peg and faith that proves the system works at least until another sifu
322192,what matters is transparent onchain governance otherwise weve learned nothing from the wonderland incident
322193,
322194,whos we im not involved with any of their projects are you if not maybe step back and let them solve or do whatever they want sjw in defi is not needed anyway this is not the chat for such things many can argue against governance and many for one opinion is no better than the other
322195,not really no one ever said that crypto was about onchain governance or selfregulating system its the exact opposite its an open system for ppl to build ppls choice where they want to vote with their capital
322197,defi wont ever evolve from the wildwildwest with this mentality itll stay a fun casino and thats it
322199,its either we selfregulate or they regulate us its that simple
322200,us telegram degens will just move from wild west to wilder westthats where the action is
322201,if you get tired i just heard theres 179 yield on ten year us treasury bonds
322202,not bad
322203,profit is profit
322204,how do you think darkfi will be regulatedselfregulated exactly
322205,id start by drawing a clear line between what is and what isnt a dao dao members expect ownership and protection and must be aware when those do not exist
322206,time mim hardly viewed as darkfi imo a charlatan and fraudster permeated the space many fell for it many still want to believe in it if that doesnt encourage community to self regualte then we are on the road to dire straits
322207,how is concave any better than wonderland tho i would argue that wonderland treausury is more transparent than concave yet you support them
322208,concave is not yet launched they resorted to advertising the project as a coop rather than a dao for this reason
322209,
322210,sers blz start fights on concave away from now lowkey muh shilling not bueno
322211,this so true
322212,defi is not a single organism and we do not control it or need to direct it into the right direction devs build users invest into whatever they want freedom
322213,this is probably the most underrated aspect of defi
322214,and wonderlands bad rap is going to be paid by all of us
322215,indeed already crypto is getting bad rep
322216,
322217,understand and appreciate the princple but liberty freedom does not need to come at the expense and exploitation of others true decntralisation dosent need regulation because the communites have the means to govern themselves hence good governance zachs work is perfect example plus many others imo nour and others are on point time is making a mockery of all the good work they are doxxed and conitnue to carry on like rogue wildlings pilfering the young deers in their headlights if they were anon i dont think we would care as much lines are now blurred and longer this goes on the more attention it will bring
322218,i think were all in agreement there selfregulation does not mean control imo its about encouraging disclosure and transparency establishing frameworks for selfcompliance
322219,
322220,yes but we can chose not to work with bad actors
322221,the whole point of regulation is to exclude bad actors from participating in certain economic activities
322222,im speaking in general not about mim
322223,other industries have adopted voluntary selfcompliance in the past in order to successfully avoid excessive regulation
322224,
322225,thats where dapps like sismo are going to change everything zk profiles
322227,we could guarantee compliance without revealing anything
322228,nan
322229,rug rating
322230,this was good
322231,indeed watched that a few days agosomewhat related if anyones looking for a more technical but still farily accessible explanation of the concepts i highly suggest this 2part blog post 2nd part linked at the end somewhere
322232,nice
322233,thanks for sharing
322234,thanks for sharing it really helps the nondev people to understand more about the concept i still dont understand how its efficient though
322238,part of the efficiency is in saving in storage spaceeg right now an eth transaction means youre storing the full call params of what youre doing on chain thats how you prove that youre really sending those tokenswith zk proofs in theory you can just store a proof that those tokens were transfered without ever having the need to store the transaction details themselves
322239,thats also very roughly why zkrollups work
322240,he provided zero knowledge proof to that 10 year old girl alright
322246,do a lot of people use aztec now i found the tech really interesting in early days and i would guess if its got high liquidity now its most likely better designed than tornadopractically tho it might be hard to compete with tornado anonymity set
322247,the higher up a hierarchy a lobster climbs this brain mechanism helps make more serotonin available
322248,fyi gnosis safe gas votethe guys from gnosis make the first version of paying the fee from safe funds if you have any wishes andor thoughts you could write them at the end
322249,interesting points by emin about why l2s arent the solution his points are also relevant for l1s that act like many distinct blockchains for scale eg kadena
322250,are subnets any different regarding liquidity and composability
322251,think subnets communicate better than l2s but as far as im aware it lacks atomicity which may lead to funky behavioractually interesting he argued against l2s but didnt talk about avax in that context
322252,every criticism stated for l2s can be attributed to altl1s also he definetly watches iguanas fuck
322253,whats the best why to play in test mode with uniswap v3
322254,yep most l1s suffer from the same issue at least those going the multichain sharding approach but havent seen any leaders in this space properly talk about this issuevitalik keeps dusting the issues under the couch strongly relying on l2s as he cant seem to find an immediate solutionin the long run these are important questions short term not so much and users wont care
322255,long term l1s are to become used by l2s only so you wont have fragmentation
322256,fwiw im glad we have at least l1 project eth thats more idealistic than the rest which are justifiably cutting some corners
322257,glad to see that spectrum play out
322258,btc maxis would disagree with you p
322259,its all perspective
322260,and tradeoffs
322261,why wont l2s suffer from fragmentation they too have scalability limitations as they are essentially blockchains so multiple l2s means liquidity and usage is fragmented across ledgers
322262,all l1s are cutting corners except eth
322263,i believe in a winner take all most scenario
322264,does anyone know why arbitrum went down twice btw did they write a report on the reason
322265,sure i do too especially in finance where people follow yield and arent married to the ledger they are currently inbut again l2s have scalability limitations if they get congested you will split over to another l2
322266,some follow yield some follow utility
322267,most follow yield
322268,arbitrum is estimated at 40 tps max think solana including fake tps does more than that atmany l2 with impressive scalability
322270,all follow yield
322271,most follow the money
322272,no most privacy chains are underutilised its the conundrum about privacy tech its always too late when you realise you need it as for privacy you need volume for it to work one person wearing a mask in public doesnt help them much if everyone is wearing them then its much harder to figure out whos who at the end which is why tornado is much further ahead
322273,is there a source with comparative analysis of how l2s actually perform i was under an impression that arbitrum was doing better than that
322274,eh maxis very much do exist
322275,how i can understand method name
322276,make it human readable
322277,try
322278,thanks not found
322279,trying to google this stuff terrible resources out there cant even find a simple tps comparison smart contract tps is usually much lower
322280,maybe therea re other registries
322281,dune maybe
322282,most of these layer 2s are just a race to 0 gas and throttling up tps anyways sorta like judging wet paint here
322283,blabla redacting
322284,convo stops the usual couch stuff feel free to share unbiased as much as possible data and thats it
322286,couch stuff 3
322287,not ur kinky stuff no
322288,lol admins these days alex dick
322289,make sure to gib tokens to seafood u skemmer yic_alex
322291,send me 10 lobs and i will consider it
322292,ya but the benefit of aztec is u can maybe be airdroooper
322293,10 lobs for 10 of supply deal
322294,okok comtinue in lobsterdap this token extortion blz
322295,we had not made a single slide or excel sheet they simply came to us had extreme conviction in what we were doing and had done a lot of outsidein research and gave us an offer we couldnt refuse he said
322299,hi andre i saw that fantom is giving each dapp its own blockchain is this relatively new it seems to be using the horizontal scaling as its solutionfantom solved the scalability issue by giving each application its own blockchain similarly to running each application on different computers that are part of the same networkeach blockchain is independent from one another and can have custom tokens tokenomics and governance rules
322300,hey its not new we at chromia has a similar design where each dapp has its own sidechain and everything is settled on the mainchain on top of that all of the sideschains in chromia have their own ibc similar to cosmos but can trade nfts data and tokens between one and other
322301,nan
322302,hi sorry i meant whether it was new to fantom as i dont remember them having this scaling direction would love to see more details also great to see more blockchains exploring horizontal scaling vs the vertical l2 scaling on eth
322303,all good
322304,does anyone knows why fantom is listed on the solana ecosystem web andrecronje
322305,its new at least on the homepage up until last month there was no mention of that
322306,sorry i dont own any ftm just think this was done stealthily
322307,meant the chromia thing
322309,actually its been there for quite a while best kept secret
322310,would appreciate if anyone has links to more details thanks
322313,
322314,solana now has shards
322315,yes 1
322316,nan
322317,looks like flashbots became good marketing label
322321,
322322,very good now help me find my keys satoshi craig wright
322323,when did chr mainnet go live
322325,why is he a scammer was wazirx a skem
322326,he legit said this on twitter spaces i met omar a few months ago he is a great guy very passionate about solving the blockchain trilemma problem i met him a few weeks ago again and he had solved it by then now we can run 10k txs per second with 10k nodes now we go to 100k txs per sec
322327,ok this is just blatant bs if thats the case he should dial ian and have an orgy
322328,check out the website
322329,removed the website to not give them publicity but ye moronic
322330,mods pls forgive me and delete if this is not acceptable
322331,
322332,excellent focus on macro theses almost as good as your halloween analysis of fantom ecosystem last yearvery cogent analysis ser
322336,thx i try my best to deliver insightful stuff
322337,only 1 threadoor per quarter
322338,tad early to write off prime brokers in tradfi have faced and solved silo liquidity for multi country multi asset multi exchange one solution is interchain tokens like tether tokens on available on multiple chains are easy to crystalize at very low cost the fragmentation of assets and chains will be solved example u can book a multi leg flight using a front end expedia and choose fastest or lowest fee or arrival time for it to choose intermediate legs macha 1inch others are on way
322339,
322341,haha 1 big common investor and wormhole type interchange
322342,yes ser would be interested if u do find
322343,i only know of a nice l1 comparison website that should launch relatively soon cant find anything about l2s though
322344,only resources i know comparing l2s are l2beatcom and l2feesinfo theres no tps comparison though
322345,got this mega list of vcs from some dude i met at a hostel last night if anyone wants it
322346,damn was this hostel in the metaverse nice
322347,looks like most bridging activity came for the snapshot and is now heading back
322350,looks like most came from avax to ftm on jan 2224 and is now returning to avax and arbitrum as far as the flows show
322351,nan
322352,centrifuge doing that with mkr and recently introduced aave pools with real world assets if im not mistaken though size of these seems to be quite nascent to date
322353,ah replying to deleted message
322354,it was a scripted shill
322355,its been nuked
322356,yeah but question was kind of interesting nevertheless beyond centrifuge have you seen much options for bringing real world assets eg nfted claims on real estate property to crypto
322357,source of this data
322358,we are working on that at however it is not about single identifiable assets like realestate but pools of realworld sme loans
322359,
322360,going to hav to just buy premium there
322361,was just looking at that as well
322362,so binance of india wazirx announced their own blockchain i literally puked looking at their docs 0 talks about architecture just buzz words blah blah
322363,when you say you puked pls explain why you puked
322364,maybe they dont have a reason to release architecture yet and wil do it in due time doesnt warrant that kind of hatei get it its pr rn but that founder built a business in an emerging market when the asset was barely regulated so why hate for no reasonwould have puked with you if it was random corp web2 business saying here chain go build but thats not the case herei have no skin in this game just saying warrant your puke with reasoning
322365,shardeum is an evm compatible sharded blockchain with infinite scalability true decentralization and solid security this is tag line they said they are working on shading since 2019 but dont have a whitepaper yet forget about tech architecture
322366,shardeum
322367,this is their one of the core documents released all i see is michael saylor
322368,see this is fair criticism thats how you put it
322370,likely just a joke
322371,now you feel me ser cant expect such shit from billion dollar project
322372,by smart contract platform do they mean the evm
322373,details not out so just wait till it is like you are waiting for solidly tokens pointless talk till then
322374,one from the doc folder released
322375,nan
322377,looking for a connect to anyone at coinhippoio for some custom dashboard needs if anyone can connect it would be awesome
322378,what platorm do you use if want to have 510 different burners number that could actual validate code for platformx burner ios app cant validate code im tempted to just go with twilio
322379,5 wrench attacks appear to be on the rise in the crypto communitybe careful sometimes when you mention that you work in crypto peoples impression of you immediately switches to millionaire or billionaire making you far more susceptible to extortionrelated crimes writes security expert dr anon
322380,
322381,oh fuck
322382,
322383,oh shit fuck
322384,jfc
322385,how much of that is alameda
322386,fck 200m
322387,nurses be waking up
322388,i represent a conglomerate of affected nurses
322389,is that just weth thats been exploited
322390,just wormhole eth exploited
322391,twilio number might get flagged as a2p look at
322392,offering him like 03 of the money as a whitehat bounty
322393,u taking the 10mil fellas
322394,fuckin all of it but this is pennies to alameda
322395,soeth seems ok tho
322396,counter w 15m
322397,yeah shouldnt soeth be practically worthlesstake a huge haircut
322400,why
322401,but thatll be behind closed doors anyway
322403,because it doesnt exist anymore lol
322404,or whatever the synthetic wormhole eth deriv is called
322405,soeth is sollet eth
322406,play now is to borrow soeth and sell it
322407,in any case id still expect contagion
322408,wat how is soeth related to wormhole eth
322409,if anything it pumps because people dump wormhole eth for soeth
322410,isnt that what you get on the other side
322411,no
322412,wormhole eth soeth
322413,afaik
322414,whats the ticker for wormhole eth
322415,im guessing nobody in solana rn wants to be holding any synth eth
322416,nan
322417,wheth
322418,wormhole eth on solana is just eth lol
322419,ticker is eth
322420,mms getting picked off holy shit
322421,muh orderbook dex
322422,thats raydium i think
322423,anyways you want to borrow wormhole eth and sell it
322424,yes
322425,can do this on solend
322426,nfa
322427,no war room around this time or ami missin somethin
322428,holly shit
322429,honestly if price is crashing better play is probably to buy it and believe in a full backstop from the corporate overlords
322431,
322432,potential
322433,wait this was exploited for real eth
322434,maintenance
322435,the need to give at least 10 discussion was had countless times not allowing it again its pointless
322436,potentially
322437,another day another 9 figure exploit
322438,yes the backing of wormhole eth has been wiped out
322439,nan
322440,the hacker receive initial eth from tornado
322441,if wormhole eth falls there might be a play to buy it hoping alameda drops their lunch money to cover hackif it doesnt fall the play is to borrow it on solend and sell it hoping to pay back loan cheaper
322442,and portals web down
322444,does this mean no more backing for wheth
322445,what could be the effects on solana defi i imagine
322446,yes
322447,it seems like jump crypto might suffer the largest loss in this theyre the ones who reached out to hacker
322448,there seems to be quite some time between contract deployment and funding from tornado and the actual drainage so a tool we spoke of before could have detected this but my issue is what would be the playbook you cant stop contracts every time such shit happens what if somebody is just messing with you so how would you even pause or unpause given you dont even know if there is an issue and if yes what it is bantegnvm this was an eoa on eth side
322449,solend mkt rn wormhole eth at the top correct
322450,probably wrapped eth on other chains backed by eth on eth are exploited trying to figure out the exploit rn looks bad tho
322452,some ppl are wondering if they even did an audit is there info about that
322453,
322454,i am noob does this effectively mean double spend for all that wrapped eth if protocols dont react in time
322455,
322456,
322457,ahhhhhhh
322458,waiiiiit the audit was only commited 2 hours ago
322459,here we test in production sir
322460,didnt get much reply yesterday is there anybody using vue 2x and web3 is it a good combo in your opinion
322461,how much wheth is out there
322462,they just added the pdf 2 hours ago pdf says its from 10th jan 2021
322463,ouch
322464,this doesnt seem like the right contract
322466,lets not drag devs into the mud either this happens to everyone they are having a hard time as is these are not forking larp devs those are real builders lets support or at least not add oil to fire
322467,solana bridge hacked
322468,
322469,maybe thats how it wenthacker must have created a signature for the function wrapandtransfereth without actually sending the tokens to the token bridge and directly published message to the core bridge contract on one of the supported chains then the message gets signed and a vaa is generated by the guardians he used that signedvaa to call completetransfer function of the bridge contract
322470,use ethersjs
322471,the tool wouldnt catch it the attacker didnt deploy any contracts
322472,hackers completetransfer transaction
322473,yup added this at the end of the message but the same question would stand even if it were the case
322474,regarding vue ive used it for some nfts and it works fine no problems that i ran into
322475,
322476,
322477,did you use ethersjs or something vue specific
322479,
322480,ethersjs maybe only disadvantage is that there are fewer codebases to look at compared to react
322481,checkout raydium ui its for solana tho
322482,
322483,solend borrow limit on eth is capped and not allowing borrows now
322484,
322485,
322486,wow
322487,wormhole eth ftx withdrawals still working
322488,so ftx is effectively backstopping this right now
322489,liquidity prob wont last though
322490,wow this vitalik tweet is straight up prophetic given the wormhole stuff he basically just wrote out exactly what happened
322491,yes
322492,vitalic is my daddy now
322493,the brains on that guy
322494,he probably thinks aboyt crypto 247
322495,what could be the plan now for that person thst found the loophole within worm
322496,
322498,unless they are a whitehat which is what we all wish for there are countless way to wash this out hard timeconsuming but possible we dont condone crimes
322501,i wonder if someone will ever take one of these exploits to a high court for ruling most project happy to sweep them under the rug
322504,
322506,
322507,whoever makes a mistake with his head pays with his pocket in italian is a rhyme
322508,solana contracts arent open source o
322509,anything coming out i hope
322512,if only there was a bridge that had been running for years with nearly 10bn volume 500m continuously custodied 0 downtime and 0 hacked
322513,are you shilling some ico ser
322514,no one knows exactly what is happening what kind of exploit peoples funds are at risk not the time to speculate or shill alternatives
322515,
322516,cue ren plug
322517,annnnd got it
322518,name 1 one unhacked bridge kek
322519,haha yeah ur welcome
322520,never a good idea to piss on a dying body agree thats true indeed
322521,im an idiot and didnt claim my 2 lobster nfts in time and ivangbi didnt even help a friend out i need all the sats i can scrounge up
322522,i disagree actually i think its unethical not to shit on hastily constructed more risky alternatives with less uptime and worse track records but yeah ill chill gl to all affected i cant imagine hacker wont return most funds with bounty
322523,i think thats a result of their toolchain
322524,i definitely wouldnt want the piss off jump ftx and alamoeba they have the resources and can extort the pressure to find this guy for sure he should just counter with 20 mil and take the money
322525,nan
322526,nan
322527,whereas on eth contracts are written in solidity on solana you write them in another language and compile them to bytecode
322528,well i know theyre rust wasm but i never explored further i kind of assumed that the eth model of verifying contracts via etherscan or similar would still stand
322529,wormholes code is on github
322530,so far hes still skipped his court date tried searching local news but nothing yet time will tell
322532,looks like theres no code on explorersolanacom
322533,
322534,you can find their code here
322535,holy shit that guys stupid
322536,could have come after the hack tho
322537,didnt check
322538,but would be weird lol
322539,can the same hack or similar be duplicated for the other chains wormhole supports
322540,he couldve bought a binance kyc for 30 in telegram groups tho
322541,yep true
322542,i am quick to underestimate
322543,which group is that lol x
322544,i dont think anybody knows yet
322545,theres bunch they sell kycd accounts for every exchange also allocations to sales
322546,were all waiting for info to come out easy on the speculation
322547,
322548,those transactions came after the hack looks like randos
322549,
322550,a bunch of people are sending him tx askimg for money
322551,
322555,
322556,dropped 20 on earning after market close
322557,dumb question but can tornado blacklist addresses
322558,so how much is he worth now
322559,no not without a protocol upgrade
322560,gotcha if they did they could be very helpful in these situations
322562,no
322564,its not designed to be helpful for cases of hacking its focused on privacy
322565,true facts
322566,the idea that you somehow can prevent those things consistently by some sort of reactive monitoring is silly imho the attackers will just figured out the conditions youre watching and work around it it may work once or twice then everyone celebrates it and it will cease to work
322567,nan
322568,nan
322569,wormhole hacker just gonna give it all away to randos
322570,what could be the risk as a user to have assets in solana ecosystem which were bridged by wormhole not weth
322571,imagine being an unsuspecting shitcoin trader when the fbi blows your door in because the hacker decided to taint your wallet with proceeds from a 320m hack
322572,he probably got inspired by sam about charity
322573,
322574,nice theory false lead
322575,he will buy tarantino nfts
322576,
322577,why deposit from tornado and directly after doxx yourself
322578,transaction in question this is only like 1 dollar lol
322579,no
322580,tornado cash 1eth transaction
322581,seems like this function has been exploited
322582,thats the one
322583,ah thats the one link to binance i see
322584,thats just noise
322585,btw isnt an issue of this hack also that the attacker coud drain all wormhole eth paired trading pairs across the solana protocols if i understand correctly the vulnerability is based on being able to mint the wormhole eth
322586,i havent read the entire conversation but this is a dumb take having privacy for the sake of privacy is all we need to justify tornado
322588,is the weth on oasis protocol going to fine these weth seems to be bridged by wormhole as well
322589,if you want privacy for the sake of privacy then it needs to be a default otherwise the only thing its good for is hacking and getting blacklisted by cexes when you try to offramp
322590,maybe they have an earlier sql dump of the chain theyre loading
322591,i think sol is down
322592,horrible take also in my opinion and also dangerous
322593,it sucks but its true
322594,you ever try depositing to coinbase from a tornado funded wallet
322595,if someone wants to have privacy as they dont end up a target they shouldnt end pigeon holed as a hackerscammer
322596,yeah and the only way to avoid that is privacy by default
322597,
322598,free money for those brave enough
322599,i practice privacy as a default but its not always easy tornado and its counterparts make a more user friendly way of protecting yourself
322600,i should have been more specific by privacy by default i mean something like zcash all the transactions on the layer need to be private if people have to choose privacy then centralized entities are going to discriminate
322601,like imagine a zcash rollup that had smart contracts
322602,so in that case the rollup acting as a tumbler i would be interested another great innovation would be private bridging
322603,
322604,no one says youre required to use cexs a b and c after using tornado though
322605,people can also use bucc not only tornado
322606,i mean if you want to offramp youre going to have to touch a regulated participant eventually
322607,not really for those willing to pay the fee there are things like local monero
322608,this is pretty funny
322609,lol holy shit
322610,solana safest l1
322611,sbf singlehandedly saving solana once again
322612,everything is safe until its not
322613,the attackers are asking for a 5 whitehat bounty to return the money too hope wormhole takes the deal much better precedent for handling future hacks
322614,where did you see this
322615,source
322616,
322617,wait shit maybe i read it the wrong way
322618,nan
322620,rekt
322621,i believe thats wormhole trying to bribe them to return the funds
322622,its certus offering herhim
322623,thats my bad the wormhole deployer is offering the bounty sorry
322624,was wormhole a well established product ive been away a while
322625,its back down
322626,eth will be added over the next hours to ensure weth is backed 11
322627,damn someone can just pull 120k eth outta their wallets in an hour
322628,tis but a scratch lol
322629,right thats wormhole making the offersomeone is backing them in a seriously big way to make that claim heres hoping it comes through
322630,pocket change for some people that have billions
322631,jumpftx why not
322632,1 charity less to donate tothey going to donate it to the wormhole foundation
322633,yes its was the only native bridge used by everyone bridging to solana
322634,actually worked pretty good specially the stable coins chain swaps just from sollet itself using wormhole
322635,shit maybe ive used it i typically use anyswap
322636,anyswap wasnt existent i mean its first early bridge
322637,ah ok thank you
322638,also i think ftx itself using it for their exchange swaps but not sure
322639,shush voncent
322640,where the fuck would that come from
322641,that got hacked too
322642,when
322643,idk it happened like 3 times
322644,hold up lemme get a source tp make sure
322645,zdnetcomarticlemultichaintokenhacklossesreach3millionreport
322646,the nasty thing about this one is that it affected approvals
322647,basically anyone who ever approved bnb and a bunch of other tokens was vulnerable to get their accounts drained
322648,best prefix that this multichain hack was old news dont want more freaking out
322651,yea lol
322652,i think people should be freaking out tbh
322653,too much money in an unsecured copy and paste code platform
322654,not talking about wormhole necessarily
322655,but thorchain got hacked to a while ago
322656,10 days old
322659,jesus thats exactly why i revoke permissions
322661,dev news highly recommended
322662,just to be safe i dont see anyswap or multichain in debank to revoke permissions but i know ive used the protocol is there another way to do this manually
322664,permanent exploit against anyone who gave approval to the old multichain contracts for weth peri omg wbnb matic avax you can check here whether youre affected
322665,more details here
322666,jump
322667,governance maybe i not sure
322668,the day that happens is the day the project dies an incredibly quick death
322669,have to say i gave solana a chance but everytime i have used it i have had painful issues or network was downoverloaded the whole better ux and even the high tps narrative for solana is utter bullshit its no better than any other l1 and certainly far worse than many
322672,i think the problem is the entire eth scaling model everything needs to be bridged long term this will have more security issues like this one
322680,which site is this
322681,i heard ftx is footing the bill
322682,it doesnt seem like it should be that hard to make an open secure bridge at least secure from this kind of hack
322683,
322684,note that solana is not part of the eth scaling model it is an l1 trying to be relevant by bridging assets ultimately homed on eth
322685,it doesnt derive any of its security from eth but it depends on it
322686,im not saying that eth l2s wont experience similar pains but at least those wont have the centralization risks that youre taking on to ease one of the other trilemma legs
322687,note this was a sc bug not a problem with the bridge model couldve happened with any bridge like it did with anyswap
322688,yep although a standard open bridge contract for evm would be usable by any evm based chain wouldnt have to rewrite it every time
322689,anyswap is os still ran into bug
322690,sure but now we fixed that bug in the contract right
322691,so future l2s can use the fixed contract and hopefully not make the same mistakes or any new ones
322692,yes everyone uses anyswap anyways but in case of solana cant use it since not in rust
322693,open source isnt a magic bullet that means all bugs will be fixed before anything bad happens what it does do is prevent bugs from reoccurring you just use the current best version anyone can think of and that will contain all the collective knowledge from people white and black hatting over time
322695,s_law
322696,huge
322697,
322698,
322699,i think its not cheap to revoke every approve it costs the same gas amount as approving
322700,i guess its just about whether you want to save a couple of dollars and risk having your balances wiped out
322701,you could always approve as much spend as you think youll need instead of doing infinite approvals
322702,wow ur everywhere
322703,seen u on bao finance and gmx
322704,sure thing it is tx with the same amount of gas as for approval
322705,
322706,were building citadaoio to bring real world asset onchain
322707,a youtuber did a feature on us recently
322708,wow incredible if true
322709,so the team knew about the exploit for weeks
322710,does anybody understand why borrowing against a synth would increases the capital efficiency of the lending protocol by not requiring each asset that is lent to be present in the protocol
322711,a is a search method nice injoke there
322712,if its not in the protocol its elswhere being potential useful i guess
322713,wonder how recourse will work
322714,it doesnt really it just means the liquidity is in a different place the concentrated amm between synth and its target
322715,its isomorphic
322716,hey guys if i wanna check whore the owner of mutisig address where i can check it thanks
322718,why wheth price doesnt dumped its same 11 on solana blockchain
322719,i think thats 2 very different topics 1 bridge comparisons2 stable coin multichain policies
322720,yes but this is probably a problem that will get solved in practical terms for example subways are bridges connecting skyscrapers chains in the city metaphor of chains and may fail or get delayed but are usefull most timesee alexnear tweet
322721,yup 2 diff topics if any resource on either thatd be great tks
322722,does a normal lending protoool even have liquidityim just trying to figure out why do this instead of the old boring stuff borrow against eth directly
322723,normal lending protocols do have liquidity
322724,its the protocol reserves the dai in compound or aave that isnt being lent out
322725,functionally in compound you could think of it as borrowing cdai and then immediately trading it for dai with the compound protocols builtin cdaidai amm and lenders are actually forced to split their lent dai between lending and providing dai to this amm with the latter not earning interest and thats one of the reasons theres a spread between the lending and borrow rates on compound
322726,interesting didnt know there was an intermediate token in compoundthat does leave me with two questions though why is there this token why not lend out dai directly how is asteria different from compound
322727,im sorta speaking schematically here dunno if compound actually has the cdai step but functionally its the same
322731,one reason to have a separate intermediate token is that it transforms our problem from determining an optimal amount of reserves to hold into designing an amm between a synthetic and its target and the latter is something we may be better at
322732,i wonder how eth originates since its unclear from the diagram depending on how exactly this works they could have etheth 9010 in the amm which sounds dangerously close to reserve banking tbh
322733,that does make sense thanks for your answers
322734,interesting mechanics
322735,the implicit compound amm is basically between cdai and dai at the current redemption rate plus a tiny fee iirc
322736,just a constant sum curve
322737,if instead you have a curve with some curvature then you may have it trading a little off target but you can use that to set your interest rate
322738,which is how rai works
322739,or dai for that matter
322740,compound maker builtin constantsum amm
322741,i guess maker sorta has the latter too now that it has the psm
322742,psm is just constant sum tho right and flat fee i personally prefer stableswap for that functionality
322743,so basically their bonding curve would be smth like that with greenred bars being the fees rate differences when borrowing xy
322744,the reserve factor is built into the interest accrued not the redemption rate at the point of swapping cdai to dai there is no fee
322745,ya i like stableswap or concentrated liquidity too price discovery is nice
322746,i thought there was a hilariously small fee
322747,it hopefully will can share my experience building out router protocol as some of you in the group know the issue is as a builder you have to proceed very very cautiously even if you have what you think is a cool product and there is a huge latent demand you continuously want to get one more audit one more pen testing process done before opening up out of alpha and letting loose and the likes of samczsun tob etc the platinum names are all booked for the foreseeable future by big wellfunded projects and the large funds and have zero bandwidth to look at the small guys like us who think we might have a slightly differentiated approach in the meantime the investors and the community want the product updates immediately like yesterday also on the matter of audits the current big vendor model is completely flawed in terms of incentive alignment even the largest names and we have worked with almost all of them are basically maximising billing and have no real skin in the game the most critical bugs for router have been discovered by independent white hat hackers or by daos like immunifi and these are also struggling for talent to service demand
322748,
322749,
322750,what would give the hacker any edge in that mev race
322752,had the exact same q yes maybe the hope that nobody else is looking into it or just some messed up bad code w no proper testing that will give a time edge before others figure out
322753,would need to be some farm fork
322754,not any real defi protocol
322755,why
322756,maybe they could do it at a weird time and hope nobody else has the necessary liquidity available on short notice
322757,seems risky
322758,and then for what any investigator is definitely gonna suspect the liquidator
322759,cause if its a familiar protocol with liquidators already connected to it easy to connect youd just love in mev cause u r then in an even playing field
322760,permissionless middleman
322761,several liquidator bots use flashloans
322762,yeah but then they need somewhere to arb it
322763,as we saw recently they sometimes fail in surprising ways during extreme circumstances
322766,do these investigation concerns even matter if the hacker is a north korean state sponsored actor
322767,agree totally re the audit companies maximizing billables and often not doing a great job anyway tbh we used to do audits at gemz for this exact reason just to fill a gap no profit was taken on our stuff but then my auditors got sniped by the big boys too
322768,if you work wish such auditors thats on you dont generalize that way ser
322769,oh we didnt just to be clear wed just do independent free audits and find exploits and vulns on alreadyaudited contracts then report those to the projectsbut yes i didnt wanna call out names so i generalized my bad ser p some are indeed good
322770,ah i c thank u for clarifying ser
322771,i dont remember any major auditing company that ever refunded a project that was audited and hacked in examples
322772,me neither
322773,_should they_ eh its hard to say i guess they dont usually guarantee safety its a check to their best ability hence why getting several is probably the best choice though at todays rates thats not possible for many projects
322774,also not too farfetched that an insider there could be exploiting the vulns if theyre not fixed quick enough not sure why this isnt high up on the suspect list along with inside job
322775,because such conspiracy theories lead to absolutely nothing they are fruitless
322776,this is correct yes just try to do your best is not about logos but about how much you care about security end of the day no one can predict and see through it all especially new experimental stuff
322777,ya true absolutely crazy thought that would never happen
322778,you do not gain much insight by being on the audit team code is open anyway you can ask same questions in discord any dev team yes you understand a teams security policy better but its not a huge edge anyway that is a dumb conspiracy which really pisses me off because it leads to nothing and proposes nothing what if all dev teams rug you actually ye whatever have a good day ffs
322779,if flashbots are considered having an edge do you really not gain an edge here
322780,that is true but apparently this vuln was found during the audit no not about a conspiracy its just a possibility
322781,i mean its one thing for code to be open the significance of which is more inflated than otherwise s_law its another to give someone the idea there are no issues when you have information it actually isnt
322782,you are not wrong coine_r its just not something you can make a discussion about cause its a dead end
322783,whats the point here is there proof any information was omitted by the auditor if you want to discuss possibilities you can do so all day in all directions
322784,ye there is no point indeed u right
322785,case closed
322787,fin
322788,well it does beg the question of the timing of a github commit to fix the vuln and soon after havent checked exact timing yet was it minutes hours but still soon after the exploit occurred it is interesting timing not making up a conspiracy theory just thinking about the timing is it possible the timing is coincidental or was the attacker rushed into executing due to seeing the commit it certainly raises questions again not pointing fingers at any party if the exploit was brought forward or born out of the witnessing of that commit then openness could be an issue in this case
322789,openness could be an issuedont open security stuff vulnerabilities which you know is an issue before actually fixing it thats not an issue of openness thats just common sense idk the details in this case though i doubt that was the real reason as its too dull
322795,all the security convos are over now use ctrlf to read bantegs ideas immunefi guys ideas samczsun and others fin
322797,
322803,closing thought on this ivangbi if you will indulge me maybe it is time for more audit daos such as spearbit where teams can come together and continuously go after bug bounties with some form of loose decentralised governance
322804,how do you go about bridging to native network token for fees without using an exchange for eg i have 1 eth on eth network and want to bridge it to ftm network in ftm but my ftm wallet side is new and has no ftm for feesi am mostly using anyswap stable pools but you still need to use exchange their to get some native token for fees yesthanks
322805,some bridges add a bit of native token for gas some times there are faucets sometimes you would have to buy ftm on eth mainnet and bridge that first
322806,perhaps you can buy some ftm on ethereum and bridge thatidk if that is treated as native ftm on fantom
322807,sometimes buy token from cex and withdraw to blockchain you can buy ftm from binance for example
322808,you can use elk finance to bridge they just convert some elk to the native token and deduct it from the amount you bridge
322809,multichainorg doesnt suport ftm avax asfaik or most times have no swap liquidity on other side so only stables work best there but gets stuck if you have no native on other side i can use exchange but the whole point is not to ive bumped into this problem several times with new networks and wallets elk finance looks like it can solve this and supports different chains thanks all
322810,we do support both avax and ftm
322811,can confirm it is though its not very clear from the ui because wftm is a thing in fantom too
322812,i meant for example if i want to go from polygon to avax theres only option to do so via usdc pool and not native tokens itll get stuck and has no point if my avax wallet is new and has no avax for fees to withdraw usdc from pool on the other end
322813,yeah this is one of the biggest issues for people trying to start a fresh wallet on other chains without a cex you have very limited possibilities of getting enough of the native token to get started you may be able to bridge 100k usdc but then can not use it because you cant pay for gas
322814,i have done so with elk finance but the bridge is of elk token native and then swap
322815,yes not much liqidity but i think combination of elk for fees and multichain stable pools may work well will be great if multichain just includes some form of swap and bridge kind of thing theres an opportunity here or im sure its there and im not aware of it
322818,you can bridge the avax token or the matic token from several chains for example you can buy matic in binance withdraw to bsc and from bsc bridge directly to polygon
322819,multiple bridge airdrop you some gas token avax bnb matic to pay for your first transaction nowadays synapse and celer have that feature
322820,
322821,it is a design aspect to be considered for router we estimate destination fee and bake that into the fee you pay at origination source you could also do this through meta transactions biconomy instance though they are not there yet for many chains including bsc
322822,you could also swap for what you have in source chain with whatever you want in the destination chain
322825,hmm so they panicked and secured funding from investors the 120k eth are still in the attackers wallet will be interesting to see their technical writeup
322826,guessing sbf backed it up
322827,why do people think that
322828,wormhole is jump same company
322829,jump paid it
322830,because it would have rekt tf out of solana
322831,pyth wormhole etc are all jump
322832,they are literally working groups from the same team inside of jump
322833,obv jump backstopped it
322834,yeah but people looking for excuses to attack solana rn and they were getting the brunt of public blame deserved or not
322835,because they print and have infinite exposure to solana ecosystem
322836,idk who saved it but somebody had to put up over 200mm
322838,jump did
322839,im telling you
322841,im fairly certain thats public
322842,not giving hackersan a lot of incentive to return it with that genie in the bottle save
322843,wormhole is from certus one which got acquired by jump
322844,so how does one reach out to coingecko their interface has been displaying market tracking coming soon for a week for our wrapper
322845,small bonus tip if you dont have a coingecko price feed curves interface will not work
322846,sir sorry i doubt it lets look at the funds raised by jump capitallatest fund is usd 350 mm typically in vc funds you see 45 years investment period and 45 years harvesting periodfunds are used to pay mgmt fees 225 commonly and to make investments portfolio should be diverse enough 304050 deals or more so that if 50 fail 2030 give you back what you invested other bets can generate those 10x or above to make sure your return rates are totaling 34x or moretherefore vc funds are not sitting on piles of cash to plug gaps from hacks they also typically have carried interest as a major part of their compensation so spending usd 200 mm or more on plugging an exploit would hardly be an optionalso there are lp agreements with each investor in a fund which restrict how funds could be spent so i cant imagine an lpa which allows to spend money like that
322847,works for me there are other ways but afaik this is prefered
322848,you are 100 right except stats for series a are way worst than what you assumed anyway there is no way jump had 200m in cash from a fund they raised 2 years ago
322849,send me pm
322850,lololol
322851,you guys do you not know who jump is p
322852,anyways
322853,ohh hi fren
322854,great to see you here lots of interoperability discussion happening here layerzero can help in alot of use cases
322855,hello good sir
322856,yea this is definitely the case they only started their crypto division in 2017 so plenty of capital to bail out their subsidiary now all eyes on that wallet to see where the eth moves
322858,cannot agree still but dmed to stop this disc here
322859,are there any dexes supporting crosschain swaps
322860,im not talking about bridges ofc
322861,rango
322862,can it use liquidity on other chains
322863,so another dumb questionjump is backing the 300m hack of the wormwhole with ethwhere did they buy those eth and did anyone already found the tx of jump buying these eths
322864,eg even if i swap fantom fantom itd be great to use liquidity on ethereum
322865,its jump probably had 300m eth sitting around
322866,fair enough but where do we see that tx
322867,thanks ill ask on their tg
322868,nan
322869,
322870,binance
322871,cool thanks clemensotto
322872,nice idea btw
322873,hi guys how can i have the same price on two different chains for my token
322874,sorry for my ignorance guys but what is the best place to get some ust on ethereum looking for busd and usdc ust so i can send it over terra bridge
322875,curvefi has best liquidity
322876,technically true but doesnt mean its best place to swap less price impact on uni v3
322877,thank you have you guys already discussed ust peg anywhere what are the main concerns or how can ust lose its peg to usd
322878,use search this has been discussed ad nauseam
322879,
322880,oof
322882,primordialaa was right again lol
322885,
322886,multi or cross though
322887,lmfao its all sunk costs at this point
322888,as long as my sol stays at 100
322889,apparently crypto has got to a point where its too big to fail
322890,we print our own money out of our own collateral it cant fail anymore
322891,go ask wonderland holders about that
322893,mad haters caused vice news to write tan article about us go tell those haters whats good
322894,incredible chad energy
322895,reading twitter reduces my empathy levels every time i guess i will ultimately fall into solipsism humanity in me will die
322896,basically reading from a script
322897,1 say something controversial2 get reaction grow audience3 4 profit
322898,it is sad but thats what a lot of accounts do
322899,anyone seen good write ups threads on dao treasury management and its pitfalls strategies
322901,not sure what you wanna read really id say the topic is quite simple 1 you mean managing usdc inside your treasury it will always be directional unless you just farm in compoundaaveyearn safe old pools which is low risk and decentralized as much as it can be and if it is instead directional even if delta neutral strategies and you have to do it offchain via some mm or at risk of liquidations you are then taking a subjective risk and causing potential issues to the longevity of the treasury you pretty much get your own sifu lmao2 if you mean token side well you cant do much with it but beg lending protocols to accept it as collateral you can diversify treasury into usdc but dont go too fanatic or you might sell too much too early what is the balance also subjective
322902,just one link but i think this articel by hasu is a great place to start
322903,another good write up is from the creator of cabin dao here
322905,i think maybe it is a bit simpler than that basically i started a multisig for a dao we fundraised from the community a bit and now realizing like if we make revenue do i allocate it out to investors in the multisig if someone invests more than someone else do they have like more ownership what if someone leaves the dao and has invested in the multisig etc
322908,it depends on the arrangements made so far what you promised etc if you are calling it a dao i assume it should all be proportional
322909,tbh i think we are using the dao term loosely more of like a gathering of nft holders who own the same rare trait in an nft collection lol
322910,right now we have done 05 eth contributions without being able to invest more so havent cross that bridge yet
322911,there is big difference in managing dao treasury that is under certain treshold and lets say over 8 figures worth
322912,so far i didnt find any relatively good details on how other projects operates big treasuries few podcasts here and there few articles mostly projects just sitting on their own token treasuries and its sad
322913,maker down bad
322914,i think it was predictable long ago when rune said that maker wants to see real world assets as as a collateral
322915,do you ever get tired of rejecting the system that brought you up fatf is bullshit wef are cunts and everything is broken but constantly arguing against it as opposed to spending peanuts 15k mo on looking at something as basic as a feasibility study surely must get tiring
322916,at some point defi has to intersect with tradfi
322917,everyday we stray further from god
322918,any opinions on what is the most performant way or package in react for a component to update rapidly imagine an orderbook that is refreshing in the milliseconds
322919,if only there was a purple pill
322920,simpler times
322922,patrizia also holds a certificate in advanced studies in blockchain from the university of zurich
322928,i feel like the us is wielding its power over defi in the worst possible way banks have to comply to fatca yet here we have a decentralized protocol that isnt subject to any legislation that must now comply with us issued regulations and for what reason exactly what penalty of noncompliance is the us going to block defi by sanction i wonder if the us govt needs to grant itself a research program to research the feasibility of such nonsense in the first place instead of demanding that everyone comply to their demands which are based in its pipe dream of wanting total taxation of its citizens no matter where they live
322929,could some clever person please explain me whats wrong with lusd seems liquity cant implement any kyc
322930,wouter says its just research but every research has some purpose imo its indicative of further plans
322931,notice that you cannot change dai contract without shutting down the whole system
322932,i call this we got pressured and are now taking public action to show compliance
322933,dai pro
322934,the daos teams want to make sure they wont go to jail for launching it
322935,the purpose is usually how to comply not avoid compliance as well
322936,i wonder if they can prove they cant comply that would be the best possible outcome
322937,makerdao is one of the best decentralized projects
322938,i mean doesnt it make sense to be curious what would have to be done to become compliant with the current system if its not compliant and its not going to be easy to become compliant then maker may want to start funding llcs for contributors to shield them from liability
322939,how can a car become compliant with rules written for horses
322940,i do truly hope its outside the scope of the core protocol and esm is super scary to think about in any case but i share your discomfort
322941,you never wondered why its power is measured in horsepower ser
322942,there are still humans who engineered the car
322943,writing code is not a crime ser
322944,those humans get targetted
322945,amen to that
322946,if you find out exactly whyhow the horse law wont apply to cars you can figure out how to reconcile the two systems and push for change
322947,is that how we ended up calling engine force horse power
322948,well at the latest fixed income leaders summit defi was a key topic of discussion
322949,in a positive way for once
322950,still scary og protocols are contemplating building stuff like that
322951,i totally agree eventually defi is going to come to a fork either its completely sovereign from meat space and cannot be governed by nation states or nation states are going to figure out how to impose their will and everyones gonna have to figure out how to cope with thatwe still dont know which way things are going to end up so its important to build an understanding of how we would have to cope if things take a turn towards the worst
322952,governance was always a bug
322953,well we know how the last time 33 turned out this time its not for number goes up but for the spine of defi
322954,people will always capitulate for family
322955,imo there is no second path otherwise we contributed to building an orwellian dystopian state
322956,you either abide by no laws or by all laws and the second one is impossible
322957,shit that makes sense too
322958,fixed income leaders are already strategising and planning how to integrate defi
322959,is that insider info or can you reveal who
322960,check the attendees to the last fixed income leaders summit in london
322961,ty
322962,kinda a prisoners dillema with each project making their own compliance moves
322963,also check speakers lol
322964,nan
322965,defi has always been an alternative an escape route if you wish we can only make sure its universally loved so it cant be easily attacked
322966,ser yess ser
322967,yes boss lead me to the wonderland
322969,govts can always impose their will through regulations that banks will comply with and since we live in a world that requires large companies to have real money then theyll be that bottle neck
322970,okok getting legally couchy here
322971,not quoting anything legalese just think the choke point is the onoff ramp for fiat for a company or more so can a defi project like aave level exist without needing an off ramp
322972,look into transient updates jotaivaltio are good state libs for that you can find some demos looking for 60fps reactthreefiber
322973,considering their kycd pro thing i dont think they have any particular issues with that
322975,ok this is just boring end convo we all understand the differences and that there is always the golden middle and its different for everyone blabla fin
322976,agreed
322977,what of equitytokens can an early engineer expect from a crypto startup a friend is being offered 025 as a backend lead and there are about 5 other engineers in the company wondering if thats too low
322978,already 5 other engineers and more personnel alongside those doesnt seem too improbable of a number then not as early then already but can try to negotiate higher of course to 05 i dont think they are getting 1 in this case
322979,thats pretty low
322980,the company is about 2 months old and other engineers are just a month or two into it
322981,ye then can try for 05 for sure but i dont think 1 is probable here
322983,thanks
322984,also consider what of tokens is for the team maybe 5 of 5 total is a good part of team equity for the 6th engineer
322985,is this really where defi is headed i had such admiration for dai
322986,
322987,
322988,wen veamzn
322989,one size fits all is going to end badly
322990,so theyre still keeping the liquidity committee i see which is like 2 guys that usually decide and everyone else just vote with them from what ive seen in discord channel hope that gets voted out would like it to a 100 bribe system instead of some weird hybrid
322991,incredible lower low instead of working on removing centralized coins from the collateral they are going further down the rabbit hole if makerdao delegates vote for kycaml they will put a nail in its coffin and ethereum would lose what was supposed to be the backbone of its economy users should warn their delegates against it in advance and threaten undelegation rn 200m is delegated 10 of mkr i guess this proposal could be expected in marchapril depending on the findings
322992,yall flipping your wig over research easy now
322993,banteg good looking out bruh
322994,all the current defi dapps will eventually split into two parallel markets cedefi vs defi regulatory pressures will become a litmus paper guess we might get quite surprised as to who ends up in which team
322995,if the crypto space united in standing against fatf and regulators there would be nothing they could do
322996,i remember i was trying to get frax to go the exact opposite direction months ago by getting us integrated in tornado cash but i think they still opted to do dai instead of us unfortunately im personally super excited about zkps that would allow stablecoins to be used as fully private cash like aztec protocol and tornado if they ever add us
322997,wouter has explained in this thread but imo this context shouldve been a part of the forum post the post makes it look like maker has compliance obligations and is working on changing the protocol and not just research
322998,srsly whats the point of defi if its not pushing boundaries the whole reason behind the decentralized aspect of it is so that it can
322999,we should be united when it comes to lobbying but founders or operators of those dapps that are not decentralized enough by the time the regulator knocks at the door might have to chose between cedefi and jail regulations will be a litmus paper of decentralization
323000,i hope they will
323001,when it comes to makerdao i understand the pros of having so called recognized delegates but wouldnt it be safer if all were turned into shadow ones
323002,i dont really get how those statements reconcile with the selection of aml tools for makerdao with a demo conducted for the community to review from the forum post
323003,okay he explained even futher in the post to my question
323004,still not sure if this whole thing makes sense but if the intention is indeed to not use them but just study aml tools i guess we are still not at danger territory but yeah not sure why they would even do this kind of research if there was not an intention to actually do amlkyc at some point feel a bit like gaslighting
323005,if a new ruling is enacted someone will have to conduct the legal research
323006,whether its funded by maker dao or not
323007,here is what will likely be the end result of makerdaos research on complianceaccording to fatf recommendation jurisdictions should recognize main developers or founders or operators as those that control influence activities within a dapp recommend that they get identified as virtual asset service providers vasps which means imposing aml compliance on themthe fatf advises a riskbased approach to deal with unhosted wallets with compliant vasps either limiting transactions and their volumes or entirely banning interactions blockchain analysis software programs are however important tools for assistance in the case that vasps do not intend to apply an outright bancompliance officer will suggest the implementation of a travel rule solution like notabene or some other vasps can use the notabene solution to embed proofofnoncustodialwallet ownership into their product discover send and receive fully compliant blockchain transactions to any vasp through their vasp directory and proprietary multiprotocol switch set riskbased rules in the rules engine to automate compliance at scale manage travel rule data transfers from their compliance platformalso implementation of amlcft complianceanalysis tool with blacklisting capabilities realtime protection against malicious actors and ability to block suspicious users and funds from transacting
323008,not sure about the new stablecoin rules though
323013,isnt the goal of defi to bring in as much capital as possibleif institutions banks etc require amlkyc cant we have bothcant have a permissionless path for whom ever doesnt want compliance this is ethereum right its decentralized and permissionless at its core but dapps can opt as they already do to provide a compliant pathmore money in circulation better for everyone and the future of defi
323014,if we bring in trillions of liquidity at the cost of the majority of capital being locked behind kycaml where legacy institutions will comfortably nest and extract rent then the point of the exercise weve been doing for the last 5 years is unclearthis capital should come to us playing by our rules not the other way around
323017,in a scenario where there did end up being two sets of liquidity where kyc liq on one side and defi liq on the other wouldnt defi slowly gain dominance on a long enough time scalei ask this because of the race to the bottom we see in regards to feerent extraction from protocols where they only end up being able to capture the value they add and kyc would have added costs that would put them at a disadvantagei wonder if there were a partypool that was able to exist in both the kyc side and the defi side would they end up migrating to defi as it is essentially defecting on those who stay in the kyc realmi hope this makes sense
323018,if you are making a kyc pool like aave and as an institutional party you subjectively believe you cant touch other defi money cause of ur vague understanding of aml you cant go to the dex really then anymore so you pay more in the kyc pool however you will probably have semikyc parties and mms who will arb the two and make their money
323019,i believe that 3rd parties arbing the permissioned and the permissionless pool is the correct answer eventually the market will be determined by the more liquid one same of what happened with cex and dex in the past 2 years
323020,arbs themselves depend on how regulations develop govs might not be able to shut pure defi or even make a ground to imprison foundersteams cos the protocol is decentralized but they can very well ensure that fiat offramps cant accept crypto deposits from any address that has interacted with pure defi or tornado that itself will prevent any legit mm from participating in the system
323021,well amms are very compatible with the vetoken model tbh others not so much
323024,i am sorry this is couch legal stuff which will prompt a wave of bullshit discussions redacted
323025,there was no legal suggestion there genuine questions to understand where the opinions above are coming from
323026,there is evidence aml does not work at all more spent than protected and it only takes rights away from people and all the accreditation stuff is total horseshit you also infringe on privacy and if you say why need privacy if you are not doing something illegal this is a dead end but we dont have to argue ethics on law stance in lobsters it makes for useless conversations
323027,less opinions more alpha please we dont need to debate the basics of human interactions here cause it would flood bring eth merge news
323028,indeed
323029,kyced defi will actually make implementation challenges listed there easier better tracking lower compliance costs global cooardination on a shared ledger
323030,in b4 kycd defi leads to enforcing accreditation bullshit preventing anyone from actually doing anythingedit im not prokyc at all
323031,the problem with aml is that regulators cannot envision a world where they dont have tangible control over things crypto enables zk checks and balances and it scares them
323032,totally agree nobody has a problem with a sensible kyc regime problem is none of the gov fucks has any incentive to open up the money playground
323033,yes now lets please end this you see this convo is just dumb couch stuff right no need for it send hentai fin
323035,banteg you have been summoned
323036,love hentai
323037,nan
323038,i genuinely dont understand hentai but this pic is a special enjoyment
323039,dont give him ideas he may go more hardcore now
323040,you might like a similar style character
323041,i get your point but it would only if if they had revenue when was the last time you did a swap on an aggregator and it routed through balancer introducing a feature to reduce the tokens float is not enough to give it utility it will still spend millions on emissions and getting close to nothing back unfortunately
323042,ok enough hentai you guys are going ot and messing with the vibe
323043,are there any attempts to make a selfsustaining immutable nogovernance algostable samkazemian has pointed out earlier that people should always prefer a stablecoin with higher collateral ratio however the collateral supply side is always looking for more capital efficiency what if the collateral were fully owned by the protocol then there is no pressure to make the capital efficient just set a safe collateral ratio like 400 issue new stablecoins only when above the safe threshold where does the collateral come then collect fees from usage and add all fees to the collateral the build up would be slow because the fees from usage are slow to accumulate the collateral however the demand should be strong high collateral no surprises from human intervention and transparent data on critical price point when collatetal ratio goes under 100 peg will always hold above that critical point might break above peg in external markets though over time more and more truly decentralized stablecoins would enter in circulationthe only obstacle for the protocol selfsustainability is the price feed an oracle imposes external point of failure auctioning sales and purchases of the stablecoin would internalize the risks however i have not come up with a sufficiently good system to avoid exploitation
323044,take a look at fei protocol its pretty much what theyre doing they are 210 collateralized with 692m protocol controllved value
323045,they have governance
323046,yessir governance decides what to allocate the pcv to most is in eth however theyve diversified to lusd dai rai and earn from liqudiity providing lending markets they actually recently merged with rari protocol as one of the first dao mergers etc
323047,then its not what i am suggesting
323048,ah gotcha youre after a no gov stablecoin
323049,rai liquity
323050,liquity needs people to add collateral need to check rai
323051,both have only eth collateral afaik
323052,the issue with governance minimized stablecoins is that price performance is the actual product of the protocol so unless youve devised a god mechanism that somehow never can break under 99 of market conditions it wont actually perform well in the most important thing stable price
323053,protocols that are agnostic about price stability like eth or amms like uniswap or whatever can be much more immutable and completely devoid of any form of human input for monthsyears without needing hard forks or protocol upgrades their product is not price stability its entirely something else
323054,why would the mechanism that i suggest break only way would be if the collateral price crashes hard this is an issue for every algostable but with transparency and high collateral no one needs to panic also if the crash is not immediate then people will start exiting as the collateral ratio nears 100 this will pump the collateral for remaining circulating supplyany system relying on arbitrage mechanisms and close to 100 collateral ratio are making up for the lack of collateral with a narrative that makes it unclear where the breaking point is which in itself invites bank run
323055,hey banteg by any chance do you know if a q4 h2 financial report for yearn will be published
323056,transparency nogovernance and high collateral ratio is the source of price stability which others dont have
323057,your mechanism wouldnt break if its 400 cr but where is the collateral located where is it deployed is it 400 cr inside of protocol controlled amm pairs what about when token holders want to deploy new collateral types what if they want to deploy the 400 collateral to some other smart contracts thats not where it was originally stored what do you do then no governance right now what
323058,hi i notice that for most staking contracts the balance of staked token sent back to the sender address is different that the amount deposited why is that example
323059,exactly they cant change no room for governance failure less riskthe collateral is in the bank contract where stablecoins can be redeemed for eth
323060,well thats nice i think your protocol would serve a very narrow but useful purpose for a stablecoin it would not be able to grow fast enough given such capital inefficiency and no ability to upgrade anything but that sounds like a feature than a bug it could become a niche favorite of groups that want the most possible decentralized option while sacrificing liquidity and use cases
323061,probably because the token value is not equal to the staked token value like a share of the staking pool
323062,yeah extreme stability and risk minimization very slow to grow without donations though i was expecting such long term banks to be accumulating somewhere already do you have suggestion what might be the most resilient price feedmechanism
323063,but its not a long term bank if it doesnt make any profit nor has any ability to it just sounds like an overcollateralized amm it basically sounds like fei but without dao governance i like fei because its the right mix of governance and overcollateralization
323064,it is a public good it might even have competitive edge in price because it does not have to pay out profits
323065,i agree that governance is good for profits but i think it contradicts stability financial markets overextend risk taking since forever
323066,the governance is not for the profits its for decentralized decision making on input parameters you should make your stablecoin protocol its a cool idea
323068,just interested in hearing thoughts at this point usually someone has already done something similar also i am an economist not a dev
323069,anyone heard of a team not verifying a contract for security reasons
323070,no that doesnt work
323071,sounds like horse shit who s behind
323072,if anything not verifying the code makes it more likely that someone who finds a bug also exploits it because otherwise whyd they put in the effort to reverse engineer it
323073,anons but has some decent fund backing not3lau in there 88m cra in that contract
323074,daryllautk darrenlautf sers blz fix that bs and save them
323076,guys talking about liquity did you see our latest product idea
323078,how you define how much tokens should be reserved for swaps and what happens if y need more assets to trade than have in swap reserve
323079,future of defi is an algorithmic governance we cant build systems without flexibility and adaptability to the market which is constantly shaping what we can do is reduce human participation in the protocols evolution
323080,1 we are working on it right now basically the methodology is follows take on chain trading volumes data from curvefi vs tvl or the pool to calculate of tvl utilised and after that take this value as an initial one and add little surplus 5 after that we plan to continuously monitor the pool operation and increase or decrease this value if necessary our on chain automation network can handle it i researching now the exact mechanics of adjustment2 if lusd order lusd token_in stabal token_out is bigger than available lusd amount the remaining amount will be unstaked from the stability pool of liquity ofc it will cost an additional gas
323081,apparently its unverified due to ipfork preventionnot really sure how i feel about this tbh
323082,immutability and the lack of human interaction is a feature not a bugimmutability must be somehow redefined here
323083,that is one way to do it and it surely has its use change via governance is much more user and dev friendly however you will never be truly resilient due to the human factorunchangeable protocol may be redeployed if needed such trial and error produces truly resilient protocols it is not most profitable or easy but such public goods can benefit everyonethis is emphasized in the decentralized algorithmic stablecoin design highest stability is achieved by huge collateral ratio but no one wants to tie in so much capital the fees from providing the service of stability are not enough to compete with other opportunities however if the capital belongs to the protocol which does not care about opportunity cost then it can solve the incentive problem that human backers would havealso governance is by definition less stable than an immutable contract which is great for a stablecoin that needs to be as predictable as possiblei am surprised how people repeat the mistakes of tradfi at the very first step
323084,central banks used to have a clear backing for dollar with goldthen they wanted to keep the inflation of dollar as stable as possible modified version of taylor rule was proposed to make it as predictable as possibleat every turn the stable predetermined predictable rules were turned down with the argument that discretion is needed i see the same pattern hereusefulness of governance depends on the application when it comes to monetary stability then unchangeable rules simplicity and transparency trump discretion
323085,but its probably a bad example to back your point since with retirement of gold standard the us economy actually grew a lot so getting rid of those strict rules turned out benificial
323086,you dont know the counterfactual so this is debatable also they have not achieved long term stability the unwinding will show the costs also i am suggesting a system for stability fed has a bunch of other mandates too
323087,not sure whats redefined its pretty straightforward one simply needs to look at makerdao vs liquity one can be neutered by going after a handful of dudes that are very generous with their information on twitter and not even that look at when it willingly voted to become a glorified usdc and friends wrapping service the other is actually impervious to that storytelling
323088,sup anyone got a link to the forbes or bloomberg article comparing turkish monetary policy to the ohms cant find it anywhere found thx
323089,interested send pls
323090,
323091,if you are talking about stability only then sure but opportuniy costs here are immense getting back to your previous message you said however if the capital belongs to the protocol which does not care about opportunity cost hen it can solve the incentive problem but someone has to provide liquidity to the protocol and they are seeking higher returns and less risks immutability leads to inability to adapt in case of attacks so here people have to trust the code entirely lock their money for less yield with no opportunity for the protocol to adapt to market conditions doesnt sound tempting
323092,this is an endless loop discussion with vastly different opinions with arguments better presented in long form so full context is not lost pls spare the group chat or take it to dms
323093,maybe i didnt explain clear enough people dont put money in for yield they can only use it to buy and sell stablecoin fees are collected into the protocol hence there are no people who should care about the opportunity cost of the collateral
323094,
323095,wait is that 100m usd
323096,yea
323097,gamestop more like game over
323098,who is from their team here explain blz why scam 1 week after launch lol
323099,have you seen the chart i was like why is it behaving like this with such news
323100,nan
323101,daily completely engulfed today to downside lel
323102,gamestopped
323103,it may have been gamestop dumping not immutable i think they didnt set any vesting terms in the deal
323105,i thought they raised enough it had its run so they defo sold at it running after listings
323106,kinda big sus
323107,looks like it
323108,hah now it all makes sense
323109,gamestop knows how to play crypto pleb has much to learn
323111,what a scam
323112,27104925 1000000 1 28104926token grant was 28104925 so 1 token off from the milestone 1 figure7 hours ago they received an additional 9368608 which is the milestone 2 figure
323113,you can verify yourself yes they all transferred coins to binance and other exchanges
323114,nan
323116,leaving a whoping 260k worth of coins
323119,but ser corporate suits did not believ in the future platform why ser
323120,this grant is more to be seen as a marketing deal imho
323121,i dont want to call names but immutable doing complete newb shit out here they could hire market maker pay him 10 and impact would be far less than its now on the chart
323122,difficult to find resources on l2 tps here is some info on starkplonks it would be interesting to see analysis with tps at which each of the scaling solutions would have optimal tx cost
323123,22m remaining balance ser
323124,nan
323125,i just went through first few transactions didnt fully check but most coins already gone to exchanges
323126,the dumping grant
323127,tax optimisation
323130,when lobsters get this grant i wait and wait
323131,another day no grant
323132,ivan mad somebody pay ivan
323133,so they received another 9mln just 7 hours ago the recent tranch of dumping grant
323134,got confused with this and the dao kingdom
323136,gme dumping free crypto tokens they got kek
323137,now they will defo think about straight dumping on open market after twitter drama
323138,yes milestone 2 reached they did the pr stunt
323139,plebs lmao why not pay few millions to quants to distribute
323140,is this how institution adoption looks like
323141,is this even legal if they are doxxed
323142,its insane they sold it right after the announcement
323143,where can i find the milestones
323144,this is why regulators want to regulate crypto
323145,theres the pic on the tweet
323146,somewhere on their website i guess
323147,this is the tweet just scroll up ppl
323148,ah i blocked photos autodownload thx to farm42 suggestion on security
323149,suspect a ton of us didnt click into the pic
323150,peak of hft
323151,why is it illegal the deal should have written everything probably but we couldnt find that out
323152,it works only with files and only with owning a very expensive 01day which will allow to escape tg sandbox this way attack will be in 0click if attacker does not have a 01day exploit then attack in 2 clicks dont worry about photos thats why it is always good to keep media autodownload off meaning files not photos especially
323153,so they can make a deal and dump it to 0
323154,a deal with imx ceo cousin
323155,
323156,for friday we got a nice small bug and hack that is easy to understand
323157,how does yearn finance calculate apy for vaults it displays 155 apy for dai on fantom while the actual apy is less than 1 lol
323158,trying to attract tvl via fake apy
323162,
323163,mars stealer can be spread through various channels such as filehosting websites torrent clients and any other shady downloaders after infecting a system the first thing the malware does is check the device language if it matches the language id of kazakhstan uzbekistan azerbaijan belarus or russia the software leaves the system without any malicious action lol is this you ivanfor the rest of the world the malware targets a file that holds sensitive information such as crypto wallets address info and private keys it then leaves the system by deleting any presence once the theft is complete
323164,relevant
323165,tldr for some reason many a malware nopes out when it finds you have russian as a language
323166,neat tcr team managed to fuck up with _allowances params order in burnfrom so anyone could burn coins from any address by allowing that address to spend your coins firstso the exploit is fairly easy you set up a contract that buys a bit of tcr approves uniswap pair to spend tcr burns almost all tcr supply in uniswap pair syncs uniswap pair reserves thus inflating the tcr price sells back tcr to drain almost all usdt from the pairlps are rekt gg
323167,of course this is the deregulated space everyone wants double edged sword traditional world uses magic internet money to raise funds reminds me of beeple immediately converting his eth to cash because they dont care about crypto just usd ironically if he waited a few months he would have made extra 70 mil
323169,people need to eat they also need private jet charters during bear market to launch next scam in next bull
323170,i dont think immutable is scam i also think immutable might benefit from this deal still in the long term horizon its just we dont know all details and such a profanity move from gamestop while they are long enough in the markets to know that liquidity is very thin for such sums
323172,they show last month apy which is inflated because of xdao farming their tg is full of ppl complaining
323173,so anyone could burn coins from any address by allowing that address to spend your coins firstam i missing something or isnt this how ozs burnfrom works too
323174,the correct impl is the other way around you can only burn coins from address if that address gave you permission to spend their coins
323175,ie if you can call burnfrom if and only if you can call transferfrom for the same amount
323176,ah yeah thats right
323179,how to calc 10 billions in solidity without decimals
323180,10 109
323181,aside from network effect why does the graph seemingly have a moat around querying the blockchain i can see the value and efficiency in a standardized service to add to the dev stack but i guess what i am really asking is thisis it that much more painful or difficult for a project to have their own api
323182,if its a daoprotocol who is paying aws to host that api
323183,often quite painful yes indexing solutions at that scale are non trivial but also not yet convinced they have a moat and once the free hosted service is deprecated well see how things goes imo
323184,agreedthey have no defensibility tho if it is a big business even if it is hard to replicate competitors will emerge
323185,but they didnt find their productmarket fit until they dont have customers
323186,developing inhouse indexers often starts with a happy path the first big rock is chain reorgs
323187,not that easy but subgraph models are public so you could build something very similar to understand data at the protocol level
323188,if one was wanting a way for users to read interact with their dapp via api and wanted to write their own solution is this even a good use of time resources reading data from a node makes sense but calling smart contract functions via api seems dangerous one could use a web3ethers script but then they would be exposing their pks at some level right this clearly doesnt seem like a scalable idea for users of said dapp
323189,there are some graph competitors like covalent but at this point in time they are less decentralised or not focused on custom data subgraphs and indexes or are focused on offering more of an api to query basic things like token balances like moralis with ivan von techs ugly mug all over it or unmarshal
323190,i tried covalent and it is way worse than thegraph in fact i didnt find any thegraph competitors except streamingfast but streamingfast is even less reliable
323191,anyone from the helium team here or anyone have an intro im putting together a partnership deal with a company that owns cell phone towers in latam looking to deploy 5000 helium miners on their infrastrucutre but having a tough time getting in contact with someone at helium
323192,reading data doesnt expose anything via ethers
323193,it is really hard to be less decentralized than the graph
323194,fo sho im trying to think of this from an end users perspective running some custom script vs being able to hit a subgraph seems like thegraph is a much more sleek offering
323195,i suppose it depends on the type of end user youre referring to if its clicking buttons you dont need thegraph nor do you need to pay aws anything
323196,have you tried their discord usually helpful
323197,the irsnews hiring consultants to develop exploitation techniques against cryptowallets tldr the irs wants to see inside crypto wallets so they can tax whats inside your crypto wallet
323198,yeah but havent had any luck there lots of community members but havent been able to connect with someone from the org
323199,how do you calculate actual apy
323200,yearnwatch
323201,
323202,they front ran the announcement
323203,gme is a publicly listed company thats for sure going to churn up problems
323204,nothing ever happens
323205,nothing
323206,
323207,should bump up their stock they just added a bunch of capital stock holders dont care about 3rd party tokens
323209,thats really awesome and interesting what do you think about this though there will likely be ways to not just borrow against gov tokens on euler but just straight up get paid to vote a certain way
323210,people think the bribes are just for vetokens but technically thats not true someone like these guys just need to build the bribing system for the normal nonvetokens
323211,rules for a horsesomething somethinggasoline vehicles
323212,ordinary lending protocols kind of are bribing protocols for governance tokens vitalik had a good post about this a while ago protected collateral on euler is the only real option governance token holders have if they want to borrow against their tokens
323213,ya i like eulers protected lending feature the most out of all the different ways people are helping unlock liquidity for governance participants i guess moreso i am talking about the philosophical implications of selling votesbribing this is a topic always in tradfi too but less so since it is almost impossible to separate the voting rights of shares
323214,i think there is a camp of people in defi that very much despiseshates governance bribingvote selling and they have legitimate points but unless theres some new tokenomics or innovations i think the current status quo will converge to people selling their gov votes for cash flow once these bribing platforms mature i take a neutral stance on whether its good or not the direction this stuff is going tho seems to be clear
323215,funny how it went from making fun of eos for bribing to going all in lol
323216,larimer should go for number 5
323217,i think the difference is that eos is on the consensus level which is quite bad dapps are different in that they live within a credibly neutral virtual machine
323218,bribing to invalidate general computation is a dangerous and different issue than bribing to increase your collateral factor on a lending market or rewards to an lp pair imo
323219,thoughts bout concave guys
323220,timerug of the year
323221,aped
323223,bribes are a terrible idea on anything other than gauges
323224,the governance premium is based on the actual option to impact a vote if you make it purely pay2win you kill the value of governance
323225,which is funny because as a bribe protocol it means you just killed your money machine
323226,governance lending is all about reducing frictions to enter the game and make the process more conflictual
323227,for anyone interested in defi option vaults we recently did a research piece showcasing the backtested pnl of these strategies
323228,is there any protocol that allows for 247 equity trading
323229,i feel like its such an obvious thing that would get tons of volume from institutional investors
323230,mirror protocol on terra had some stocks
323231,unlike plebs institutional investors value their sleep
323232,but theres lots of after hours stock movement thats only available for certain big institutional investors right now
323233,imagine democratizing thats
323234,that
323235,you use an oracle when markets are open and let free trade set prices when markets are closed
323236,ez
323237,if someone creates that give me a cut
323238,does robin hood and shit like that trade paper while market is closed i imagine they do
323239,of course they do
323240,thats all they trade my bad
323241,idk only to hedge i think they dont trade to profit
323242,theyre an exchange not a fund
323243,they try to be position neutral
323244,
323245,i feel like im missing a lot of context here
323246,also do 13 year old zoomers really follow nft micro trends like that sounds kinda made up tbh
323247,its not
323248,you think some of the biggest rappers and athletes in the world sport bayc but microtrends revolving around it dont make it to zoomers eyes k there are articles all over the internet talking about this conspiracy
323249,whats the conspiracy
323250,you can read figure it out
323251,i dont know what you are referring to either are you sure conspiracy is the word you were looking for
323252,if you dont know what im referring to how can you question my word choice
323254,im not flooding this channel wrt this just posting my tweet and fucking off thanks
323255,huh
323256,conspiracy theory better choice of words
323257,something about nazis im really confused
323258,i think we can all agree nazis bad
323259,what else is there to it
323260,i read the whole thing a bit of a stretch to say some random french philosopher having the same name as a monkey means that theyre nazis
323261,ah trading is available to anyone with a brokerage account eg through ib main reason preventing protocols from creating a 247 stock market is obv regulation cos derivatives on securities fall under cftc remit 100 and spot under sec
323262,polygon liquidity mining 20 gamefi
323263,not sure what you mean through ib i work at an investment bank and i definitely cant trade after hours lol
323264,and defi fixes all that regulation stuff
323265,100
323266,very nice read retweet by benn eifert confirms the quality of research
323296,ib as in interactive brokers
323297,really digging for that as well still my point re reasons for lack of widespread securities trading protocols stands
323298,muh governance
323299,the defi options piece is dont sell covered calls in a bull market
323302,this is just a snapshot vote and not an onchain gov proposal tho rite
323303,sure but now theres gonna have to be a whole debate on whether or not to recognize it and what kind of precedence will this set
323305,
323306,new amm fork by influencers
323307,im very intrigued anyone know the team
323308,would assume guthl does
323309,i do indeed
323310,do we ape
323311,it is not live
323312,could i get an intro
323313,will do later im on vacation
323314,ryder is just crazy
323315,
323316,interesting so the patch everyone found was coincidental it also fixed this problem but it came from a toolchain upgrade
323317,also 10m bounty for arrest of the hacker
323323,redacting stuff that is not interesting sorry
323327,good analysiis from mikko
323328,
323329,added listing fees costs 05 of circulating supply to add a gauge fees are distributed to venft holders
323330,hm its a totally diff project now
323331,the venfts are basically more valuable now w this
323332,anyone has a good alternative to thegraph to create api my dream scenario would be something similar to dune but having a json api
323333,hey guys i worked on a free crypto hub without any subscription or private group models to aggregate information and make it publicly available i am doing it all by myself right now during my spare time but it might be useful for the few here who are not 247 on ct to get information at a single place please check it out and im open for any feedback suggestions and also correctionscontent1 weekly news highlights2 collection of important articles threads of 100 projects3 treasury overview of guilds4 token unlock schedules5 yield farmingamm lists6 collection of useful data stats7 airdrop tables8 helpful resources tools9 event calendar10 governance votingsdeadlines11 and more
323336,something happening in ethereum net cant make a transaction fantom working tho weird
323337,gas war from karafuru mint
323338,not likely gas price is about 38 gwei on eth
323339,yea infura rpc seems to be down
323340,oh ok can i just use another rpc if so is there a list somewhere
323343,looking for it too if not gotta lookup quiknode or alchemy
323346,polygon also doesnt seem to work
323347,use pocket rpc
323348,
323349,great thanks
323350,is this a camouflagedshill
323351,no is not rly sometimes u an use pokt rpc cause it just works
323352,never had any issues with poky so really recommended
323353,is there a simple tool i can use to send a onchain message via a tx to someone all tutorials i can find are outdated and metamasks ui is a royal pain in the ass
323354,im this short of writing my own tool just for this purpose and to make it public so others dont have to go through this bullshit process but if there is a oneclick ui somewhere ill use that
323355,have u checked this mailchainxyz tool already mailchainmediumcomsendingmessagesonethereumtestnets642d10a3d530repo githubcommailchain
323356,i might be wrong but is that not what etherscans blockscan chat feature is for
323358,or perhaps
323359,just send a normal tx with 0 eth and your message as hex data
323360,nan
323361,and a tool like
323362,nan
323363,ja but the tools that i had found dont convert to the right format this definitely doesnt do the trick as tx gets rejected
323364,ok thanks seems like onbrn is the thing i want
323365,merci
323366,is eth network unusable right now or am i stupid
323367,nan
323368,infura rpc problems
323369,ah its not just me then thx metamask is also broken
323370,metamask uses infura
323371,sigh
323372,gas estimations are all wrong cant even cancel pending txs
323373,use this rpc if u r observing problems in ethereum
323374,
323377,ive tried a few of those including pokt and still cannot send a tx i keep getting inherent gas too low
323378,lol at current gas at 53 gwei tells a long story of how decentralized we are effectively
323379,alchemy works
323380,lemme try that
323381,if you use frame instead of metamask you can change with one click i recommend you use this opportunity to give it a try
323382,even w pokt metamask calculates ur gas spending wrong manually input like 5 for priority and 200 or whatever it is currently for the base fee worked
323383,
323384,
323385,do u meed pokt to use this rpc
323386,no its similar to setting up matic or arbitrum
323387,thank you
323390,ctrld 1 message above redacted
323392,you guys think looksrare will survive after the halving
323393,im not totally sure if it will be able to get volume and users in the long run but im not selling so yes i think it will do okay
323394,why not opensea is often down regardless of looks emission right
323395,agreed i think its possible and i personally have been listing stuff there and looking there every time its just the entrenched habits opensea will need to start offering more though
323396,if youre too inexperienced to navigate barely advanced metamask functionality dont make general infrastructure comments here which do require broad nuanced knowledge there are enough serious decentralization bottlenecks in this space atm no need to throw in invalidmisleading ones
323397,yes but most of the hype right now comes from the apr
323398,and if the apr drops too much the price will drop a lot which will also make all the normies leave
323399,i mean most nft owners arent experts in crypto
323400,maybe better opinions here
323401,for me im hyped about owning part of the revenue from the marketplace so i have been using it to list stuff and look every time i buy and sell but there is a network effect obviously im not going to buy a worse nft just because its on looksrare collections still have bigger selection on opensea in pretty much all cases
323402,that wasnt my intention dont you think there is at least some correlation
323404,will check
323405,my whole point was merely that lots of retail uses metamask and its rpc being down reflected in network usage
323406,infuras dominance indeed is a concern that you dont manage to send a transaction when metamasks gas estimation is flawed due to it using infura is not
323407,i agree with that still learning new things every day
323408,i believe its actually rather the opposite when things stop working people start digging why its not working in the process they may well end up discovering what infura is and why things like pokt are a potential improvement to it due to decentralization
323409,problem is the metamask ui imo no quick way to switch rpcs
323410,something like frame has would be ideal
323411,as always its reflexive on the way up and its reflexive on the way down the temporary ponzinomics of looksrare served the purpose of people trying out their app unfortunately they kicked it off before they had a better product than opensea
323412,just wondering so if you send a transaction when the network is down it will automatically be dropped after a while
323413,the network is not down just the rpc
323414,beware that there are whales which harvest the looksrare apr whilst being hedged against the token price via perps on ftx some more spiritus to add into the reflexivity on the way down it might well be some more profitable weeks ahead though who knows
323415,how can be profitable with the funding rates
323416,1 issue is like with infura opensea is a single point of failure since nfts draw data from their api i believe but gives them a big monopoly right now all looksrare volume is wash trading for rewards
323417,indeed today i dug down that rabbit hole and thanks to all you i figured it out invaluable
323418,any instance of erc 721 tokens drawing data from opensea not sure if thats the case
323419,yeah nfts usually dont use opensea as their metadata uri unless they were minted on opensea
323420,i saw the experiment of that guy making a nft being shown as different different metadata i assume depending on what youd yes to look at it it was looking different from os form rarible and from a wallet in one of his latest blog post cant find the link back sorry he was saying that os blocked the api calls and delisted for that specific nft and doing so the nft was blocked everywhere
323421,it was the moxie one talked a bit about that here
323422,jepsen radix dlt 10beta351article comments
323423,in our testing with five to tennode clusters of m5large instances we saw transactions start timing out with as little as one request per second andgoodputgenerally peaked at 16 transactions per second1 million tps will yet be a while away
323424,oh my
323425,werent radix doing like million tps sync demos like 3 years ago
323426,they were
323427,and then came the pivot to eos but worse the jepsen stuff is pretty thorough
323428,ha oh dear
323429,damn seeing the eos name after a while
323430,btw is there any guide or template on how to set up a local dev environment for erc20 i want to play with the ohm contract without deploying to testnet and simulate bonding to understand the mechanics a bit better
323431,did you actually do the math
323432,good question
323433,
323434,thanks lol weird coincidence just searching brownie after hearing about it in the bankless podcasts curve war episode
323435,imho if we talk about retail no frame would be ideal client cycles rpcs under the hood until it finds a working one and uses it pro mode or whatever lets you add custom ones
323437,rdx works asserts that as of january 27 2022 all identified safety issues have been fixed liveness issues with individual transactions have been fixed and one issue relating to performance in networks with nonparticipating validators remains they also report that with multiple test passes running hundreds of thousands of transactions across multiple test networks rdx works is no longer able to reproduce the resolved issues jepsen congratulates rdx works on these advances jepsen has verified none of rdx workss claims since the end of our testing on november 5 2021
323438,not sure whats the point of your post we both know youre fully aware that the current network is 1 shard advertised as 50 tps and higher tps is in the sharded version 2 years down the roadmap or live in dans rnd network legitimate question which i did ask is why did jepsen limit out at 16 and not higher and i expect them to do public stress tests to verify this in the future
323447,the point is the thing youre replying to
323448,which is quoted from the jepsen analysis radix paid for much to their apparent chagrin it was more scathing that they would have liked
323449,lets please end radix convo thx
323451,buidlorrrrs
323452,hi there
323453,hello ser great to meet you can i dm even though i dont dm first i promise not a scammer lol
323454,
323455,of course ill report back here if you are
323457,so they are using pool assets amounts to determine exchange ratio pretty much just like uni router but i guess without the curve because checking daieth exchange ratio would differ depending on the amount you check against but then if you wanted to borrow x eth against your dai at lower x youd get more eth per dai than at higher which makes no sense on a lendingborrowing service i hope they time average these pool readouts or it will be flashloaned into oblivion quite surprised they already provide it as a public service api
323459,unrelated topic any other builders here going thru hard times sometimes it gets lonely as fck if u feel like sharing dm me
323460,yeah i try my hardest to stay off telegram on weekends but here i am
323461,gotta be more disciplined and stay grounded in reality at times
323462,i was asked if i wanted to live in a crypto hacker house could you imagine anything worse than not being able to unplug id go insane being surrounded by endless defi nft chatter
323463,and shit the people who hear that i work in crypto are like haha what do you think about dogecoin and elon musk
323464,jfc leave me alone i really value the ones who are sceptical of it all and only give a shit about the new cafe opening up in town
323465,the ones who see a pastry go up in price by like 25c and say damn the worlds changing or whatever im completely desensitized to these amounts look at how wormwhole just got patched up in like an hour with more money that some people may see in their lives
323466,cobie was talking about how ppl in his life were talking about not meeting rent and ppl in his phone not being sure if they needed a waterfall in their coming space houses to keep the o2 pure from plants
323467,shit i cant say i relate precisely the same way but i sure do feel something similar sometimes
323468,not just builders ser i think all of us who spend most our days behind a screen go through this just like sunny said there is little to talk about when you spend 90 of your time in something that others dont want to understand
323469,why do you guys ignore kashibentobox when discussing sushi is nobody using kashi is kashi the actual infamous 13 users protocol instead of synthetix
323473,check out flipside crypto exactly what youre looking for
323474,i dmd you
323476,wasabi
323478,anyone know the best stable coin pool im heading away for a little remote work and just wanna cook some stables
323484,i think this actually makes a lot of sense since it organically includes collateral slippage into computing position healthsuppose that the user makes a 10m deposit in some lowliquidity coin and borrows against that if you allow them to borrow 65m but the liquidators can only actually sell the collateral for 5m then you have a position in the protocol that is only solvent on paper but if you just directly take dy from uniswap this risk is accounted for
323485,
323486,um thats a little above my pay grade
323487,its an inactive pair if im not mistaken
323488,their headline apys are also before fees unlike with ribbonyearn which is pretty dishonest tbh
323489,yeah some dovs today are too riskyproper dov design brings apy a little more than the market with less correlation
323490,talking to people who do same in crypto helps to stay motivated large difference with online text communication for mealso irl cowork with team members
323491,hmmmm doesnt ribbon do the same marketing trick as friktion
323492,the website at least claims to take the fees are taken into account
323493,and we show historical pnl not hiding any information
323494,if you feel we are hiding any info lmk i will fixtry to surface it on the ui
323495,the formula they posted doesnt account for the fees but they do account them kinda weird to include the formula that doesnt include the fees tbh
323496,i guess the fees are baked into curr weeks performance
323497,current week performance doesnt account for fees only the projected yield does
323499,juliankoh maybe have the annualised mngmt fees and performance fees included more explicitly in the equation
323500,based julian
323501,not hiding anything here appfriktionfiincome
323503,we do that for projected yield and yes that should also be in current week perf
323504,can u clarify something re sismo are generated proofs constantly updating or they are snapshot taken at certain point in time id assume its former but want to be clear
323507,nvm removed wrong link
323508,here it was
323509,deensomally
323510,even better find any working node from list and use it automatically
323511,ps our analyst made backtests on eth covered call strat for the previous year tried to explan nuances of proper strike selection
323513,
323514,web2 angel w web3 angel investing
323515,most of web3 projects are speculative pd unrealistic valuations
323516,thank you appreciate this
323518,next bridge exploit it seems from the hundred finance discord
323519,yes
323521,
323523,
323524,dunno what and how true just defi stuff which is rare these days
323525,volatility decay
323526,making smart choices in web2 angel investing vs just be early in web3 and put as many bets as you can
323527,
323528,finally rereading this
323529,nan
323530,why does every discussion have to end with taxes no need to respond just memeing
323531,i cant really argue with what is said there tbh it feels like monet makes total sense but somehow reality doesnt show those things to be an issue in his scenarios
323532,staking derivatives centralization blablalooks at any other governance no big difference whales exist everywhere
323533,funding rates are approx 05day
323534,short term incentives bribeswhere locked token holders can increase the net present value of their stake by favoring short term focused payout increases either through risky protocol changes or accepting bribes at the expense of long term value creationwell what is longterm anyway so far it encourgaes other daos and communities to pile up and vote for themselves so it works in favour of vecrv instead
323535,idk not seeing any of those concerns actually be real
323536,in order to get holders to lock up you need to incentivize them with an additional reward this would be a concern at the start that the flywheel could have never worked but it does and treasuries big lps daos pile it up and not sell so does it work yes so far and so far is a long time already
323537,did any of the criticism make sense to u michwill
323538,
323539,well it works because holders are incentivized with revenues not inflation
323540,how much is a long time a year
323541,it has been great for 15 years so far
323542,not very long if wed consider financial marketseven crypto history wiped successes that ran for longer than thatmodel is cool but think we need more time to really evaluate itand mainly need bad economic times not just when markets are easy and money is free
323543,if i wanna use foundry whats the easiest way for me to setup a simple front end to interact with my test contract
323544,or i guess i can download the simple frontend from hardhat right
323545,
323546,also check out
323547,today is the day i stop playing aoe and learn this shit
323548,its worth it
323549,depending on how badly you need an actual frontend cast a part of foundry might be enough for you
323550,basically it allows you to interact with a contract that you have an abi for from the command line
323551,id personally like to see more research around the impact venomics could have on maker specifically rather can conclude that it will work because it works elsewhere for 1 year already mkr has that last resort backstopping and the esm which are not common elsewhere even generalizing venomics have yet to prove itself in more varied market conditions and longer timeframes and the maker token dynamics arguably needed a level of scale to show its strengths
323552,not to say im against it it would be bad or it would be great etcwhat do i know but this should at least go thru months of research and discussions and not be something decided on and changed abruptly its not the first time ppl suggest to change that system based on latest trends
323553,right after this campaign
323554,ah ser for sure for maker ye it needs to he tested more adrianleb and take months indeed i was referring to the fact that in curve context these concerns didnt actually seem like they manifested in what monet is calling for yet
323555,maybe not but yeah all in all different systems different governance cultures mechanisms etc
323556,my take on monet is simple
323557,he represents the view of vcs more or less
323558,the main objective of vecrv is to create a longterm alignment of interests
323560,it is in fact so longterm that vcs cannot commit to it
323561,a typical 10year vc fund would
323562,need 1 week vesting so they can dump on plebs recent case ptp platypussay
323563,well you can clearly see which funds do that and which not if its up
323564,ofc
323565,the irony here is that the gbmkr proposal was originally posted by a vc
323566,lets not make this a war on vcs thing again also doesnt answer the many concerns expressed
323567,im an experimental physicist if we have unanswered concerns lets observe the ongoing experiment and we will find the answer
323568,agree lets proceed to observe the current experimental model rather than pivot to another even more experimental model because it seems to work elsewhere
323569,i was having a very respectful and insightful discussion with hasu yesterday in another group about vecrvvefxs tokenomics we didnt get to conclude it because there were too many topics to bring up but one thing that i brought up which could be food for thought for other vetoken critics is that vetokens create pos dynamics on the dapp layer i think this is an underexplored advantage my opinion is one cant be pro eth lido steth and other derivatives but then claim vetokens become captured and tokenized by convexlike protocols and cvxcrvcvxfxs are bad
323570,in any case hasu and i didnt get to finish our discussion but would love to expand on these views soon when i have time
323571,can we read it back somewhere
323572,thats bc of funding rate that went from longs to shorts just as with any perpetual
323573,i think it was a private group unfortunately i think its just easier for me to either write out my views or if hasuothers wants to discuss on a podcast probably easier in a conversational manner
323574,rough explanation with leveraged derivatives you either pay for the leverage with money funding rate or risk risk of liquidation
323575,1 4 pod
323576,pod
323577,i know hasu has his own podcast but happy to lend you a platform for it if youd like ethereum cat herders podcast
323578,vbuterin proposal for new transaction format much cheaper but not evmexecutable
323579,assangedao changed plan to have 2 cycles at last minute
323580,volume still coming in almost 125k eth
323581,sers anyone can help with hardhat testing on forked network i used it quite a few times with solidity written contracts but now i thought if i can use it to test a ts file that uses abi to call already deployed contracts addliquidity in my case on uni v3
323582,
323583,complexity does not scale
323584,can you expand on what you mean by that
323585,would be awesome to hear you on uncommon core
323586,haha thanks but not up to me up to hasu
323588,so cancel culture is going to rekt my ens holdings rip
323589,the hypocrisy here lmaofireeyesdaoeth cooopahtroopa co is proposing to remove brantly from its position
323590,wen gubernance vote to revoke certain ens names
323591,not at all just speed up the process
323592,can we cancel domains
323593,sure would be funny if they seriously considered that because too many bad names were being made
323594,get canceled one week and cancel someone else the next week smh
323595,cancel it forward
323596,havent felt this space so down bad in a long while
323597,please cancel mass adoption if it comes with this bullshit
323598,it is inevitable ser society is coming at us
323599,next cancel officerciaeth after ciagov takedown whats going on worries me
323600,we will shape the future of web3 together
323601,hey guys heard of some saft otc groups or dealers anyone know where to join any of these groups
323602,cant tell if i disliked this particular cancel period or dog coins season last year before the bearish market
323603,it all went downhill starting from simp daos
323604,yearn the og andre simp dao
323605,wen will people start protecting web3 values the space is experiencing an abhorrent takeover
323606,unfortunately its just gonna become more web2 as we go wait till data farming and advanced fingerprinting kicks into full gear
323607,we just started shaping the web3 values
323608,irine nft artist joined jan 2022
323609,next phase theyll start doxxing dao voters to disqualify them from voting by airing their dirty laundry
323610,it is what it is
323611,its a double edged sword theres more data than ever before and lots of it can be useful and add value and at the same time is gonna create even more perverse tracking
323613,oh no some squanches are best kept secret
323614,web3 was always about tolerance and inclusion stacy in web3 since spring 2021
323615,its not
323616,honestly it all went downhill from the moment people started to implicitly believe that it is a protocol as long as there is snapshot voting
323617,youre missing the point
323618,right
323619,progressivist concern trolling will be a death spiral for ethdaos
323620,mewny posted a nice meme on twitter a few months back but i cannot find it when an outcast minority builds a nice community then the majority wants in and force them out again
323621,for many people its what is happening right now imagine being a cryptonative as yourself for years only to see nft memers join in late 2021 early 2022 to cancel you
323622,new reality i guess not judging btw it is what it is
323623,imagine they discover luke dash jr kek
323624,
323625,someone needs to tell normies that btc maxis drink raw blood and eat uncooked eggs
323626,shift the attention away
323627,the only thing to really protect subcultures is to make it inaccessibleheavily gatekept and not judge the success based on a metric like size monetary value etc
323630,bandwagonerslatercomers always try to ruin the very foundation of what makes crypto valuable such as privacy anonymity soon these cancel culture types in ethereum will be calling for more regulations
323631,so many grifters in eth space now
323632,meh the wonderland drama did more damage than this current ens issue
323633,from a financial perspective sure but who got cancelled no one
323634,0xsifu will just delete twitter and be fine a doxxed person cannot do that
323635,no one and thats the problem
323636,sifu gave a lot of ammo to anticrypto and antianon people but the woke crowd is what would actually destroy it unless we do something
323637,noooo we need to keep posting underage girls nooooo
323638,cancel them
323639,has anything like this happened before perhaps behind closed doorsbut not in the public right
323640,maybe we stop glorifying devs and their hot takes
323642,crazy thought
323643,4channers cannot hold themselves ik
323644,this
323645,freedom of association
323646,freedom of association encompasses both an individuals right to join or leave groups voluntarily the right of the group to take collective action to pursue the interests of its members and the right of an association to accept or decline membership based on certain criteria
323647,i think the real solution is more about educating the newcomers about the culture of our space and less about getting angry at cancel attempts
323648,or you can not care about some literally who trying to conflict farm on twitter
323649,
323650,its not like vitalik said it
323651,i have been meditating on this thought a lot ofc i agree and partially it will happen naturally but at the same time newcomers will affect the ethos themselves as the numbers grow big we will eventually become web2 wont we
323652,brantly didnt even apologize cooopahtroopa was 15 or so when he went through his gangsta phase and still got cancelled after all his contribution wild
323653,at 15 hormones control you this isnt fair
323654,web2 ethos is like paypal where they can rekt your financial livelihood for political wrongthink decentralized finance should be where it is impossible to cancel your financial existence
323655,yeah i dont think brantly has handled this wellhis defense atleast
323656,i dont think anyone is trying to cancel his financial existence
323657,brantly handled it correctly fyi
323658,i am hoping someone on here can help me regarding transaction history on lobstr
323659,you can only have this naive view if you havent seen the same happening to open source devs linux scala etc the reasons for engineered outrage are always superficial and irrelevant
323660,suppose that due to some weird shift in normie political discourse you would have to apologize for your deeplyheld beliefs that you carried from your childhood how would you feel
323661,i literally dont care about some literally who catholic posting if crypto were actually under assault from woke activists youd be one of the first people cancelled for posting borderline child porn its obviously not a huge problem
323662,this is coming btw its not a hypothetical scenario
323663,it has started it is whats happening right now
323664,two people have been ejected from the space using the same playbook and you are still oblivious
323665,how were brantlys olds tweets found suddenly
323666,prolly some advancedsearch bot found them looking for keywords
323667,twitter has easy search
323668,so what is this a cleansing attempt
323669,they arent that old and he clearly still believes these things its nothing like coopah
323670,the reason is always superficial you can see just above how someone tries to paint anime art as something its not
323671,attempt to control and latch onto successful projects
323672,how does a technology class have values i think thats more ppls personal ideals youre talking about
323673,how does a technology post takes on twitter
323674,i think one of the first and best examples of web 30 tech is siri no one attaches ideals to it
323675,cypherpunk values really
323676,
323677,check the comments pure hate
323678,i mean how do u reconcile that with this
323679,nan
323682,dude digged up a 6 year old tweet of brantly being xphobicpeople trying to remove him from ensyadayadayada
323684,in web3 you wont make it unless you exile 10 dao contributors
323685,this is the real pvp market
323686,if you looked at anyones life in such detail youd find similar contradictions this is just dumb crypto is the ultimate meritocracy stop trying to bring politics into it
323694,the police is here pack it up boys it was fun while it lasted
323696,thats it isnt it someone can find something that for whatever reason sets them off and it will also set a group off if it sticks together it rolls and gets bigger i dont see how this is avoidable it happens in every space and has been happening for ages
323697,all the discussions are seen above where sers already chatted on it just scroll up done convodeleting every comment
323699,sometimes i think as adoption happens it has to be more about a core group of participants who are dedicated to the ethos even if much of the space succumbs to the abhorrent as long as there is still a safe refuge for those who still believe in openness and decentralization the cancelled and marginalized will still have somewhere to go an indestructible haven that permissionlessly protects any who would gather under its banner
323700,i was in discussion view feel free to delete if its a comment too many ivan
323701,the sage continues
323702,all old tx from dec2021
323704,whats this fund
323705,oh and no dont comment we cant care for your stance on social topics go code
323707,the dark truth is dao does have org to back it up irl and its board of directors can ignore dao at its own whim
323708,so in this case they didnt even follow through with their own dao procedures instead cancelling in web2 way
323709,0x712d0f306956a6a4b4f9319ad9b9de48c5345996 is sbf supposedly
323712,they doing an otc trade or what
323713,this is the third taylor tweet linking sushi issues to wonderland anyone know why
323714,ya im kind of curious about this too anyone have more info
323715,i mean he only lost a position on the underlying company he can potentially keep working for the dao he only lost like 10 of its delegation power so he still has support within the dao
323716,dani got voted in for sushi leadership right
323717,ofc he is probably currently on a sour position with its previous work partners due to the nature of the termination
323718,but this also means is that dao is not truly in control of ens assets and goodwill theres at least one other entity which is ruled by private individuals
323719,im not going to say that ens dao is a scam just yet but certainly starting to feel like it
323720,yes but that was after joseph quit and a few proposals were submitted by interested parties
323721,yeah the legal entity organizes the legal stuff for ens like the cloudflare deal and all other stuff with the nigeria i think it was nigeria government for the eth
323722,yeah but he was still daos to be hanged or exonerated not nick johnsons
323723,ethiopia
323724,wait but he wasnt released from its duty on the foundation just yet
323725,neither as a steward of the dao
323726,legally you are correct
323727,but practically this undermines the credibility of the whole dao governance concept
323728,because suddenly we have fine print that theres ensrelated entity which is outside dao control
323729,idk i feel that was always clear since the beginning that tnl was the core software developer company behind ens of course the protocol isnt resilient at all against this kind of attacks right now as its quite new and it was never thought before the token that it should be decentralizedafter they launched the token they started to think about how to decentralize it and it will be a long process imho
323730,not making rash decisions and voluntarily letting dao vote on this is not rocket science
323731,even sifu was only removed with an official dao vote
323732,but its something like for example if some controversy arises around lido and p2p decides to let go that particular engineer they can afterwards vote on it for lidos dao but p2p has all the power over whom they employ
323733,but you dont need a legal entity for a 33 ponzi
323734,sorry but dumb comparison
323735,thats fine though treat it as one of the companies on top of ethereum the reason why you are mixing it up with the dao is because ens is a recent community they just removed the person from the web2 entity uniswap labs uniswap dao for example
323736,cause then u should follow procedures
323737,but they didnt remove him from the dao p
323738,even still he has a ton of support 90 delegation retention
323739,exactly edited my post so i am not sure what you are onto vorot93
323740,if theres a web2 entity left behind which is not controlled by dao then the whole thing is decentralization in name only
323741,a scam basically
323742,true names limited tnl the nonprofit that funds and organises development
323743,is that the core ens entity for the dao or no i am under impression its not that
323744,as i said ivangbi vpepo you are both legally correct
323745,i understand artems point tho its quite shady provide a negative community signal just based on a twitter controversy without allowing for people that actually put stake into the dao to vote and weight in if brantly provides more value vs this controversy
323746,but this does not inspire public confidence
323747,100
323754,no social blabla
323755,sorry pepo 3
323756,all gucci ser 3
323757,i cant really agree here becausehe wasnt removed from the dao nor was his ens tokens were taken away imagine lmao he was just removed from the web 2 entitybut the public is dumb as always so they will mix the two ens should probably communicate better that it was not a dao move hence does not concern the dao the non profit just decided this thats all
323759,which kinda means that the whole dao thing is a scam
323760,it only means that the majority are idiots which is true it doesnt mean that the concept and what is done is a scam 1 only do the work yes 1 are richest yes thats fine moreequal opportunities and moreopen systems i dont see scam
323761,democratic voting will always be messy daos will devolve into people try to siphon funds away from the dao im listening to the ens community call and many were unironically asking for token reperations from ens because their feelings were hurt by brantly whats to stop concern trolling and corporate style raiding for dao funds seems like a serious attack vector the achilles heel of daos
323762,i wonder how many of those people asking for reparations actually have the token though would they be able to actually push the proposals through or are they just bluffing
323763,organizations are criticized by an opposing section for both taking action or not taking action upon pressure from a subset of the public ubergoogle on women empowerment the question is whether the foundations move was a kneejerk reaction to public opinion which you assume here or its own call to stand by certain values and taking a call when evidence of a member violating those values came to light by its own accord its already clear that the foundation and dao are 2 different entities and the foundation can have its own values and decision making process
323764,nice reply yes the only public wyes differentiator would be imho 1 shitcoin go up nobody care values and 2 a lot of education around the issue on the separation between dao and web2 entity to help people understand this was not a dao decision
323765,no one made a proposal for reparations i doubt if anyone did it would go anywhere
323766,seizing his wealth is against what decentralisation stands for that is digging a deeper hole than what already exists he talked hate got put in his place no reason to revoke his non vesting assets
323767,it is a valuable lesson about limitations of daos and of ens dao specifically
323768,is there autolooping platforms
323769,impermax is closer to that probably
323770,i wasnt arguing for taking duh lmao wtf joel i was saying this was not dao
323771,whats that
323772,borrowing and lending from yourself in a loop for bigger apy
323773,this is where the question of legitimacy becomes problematic though suppose that tomorrow the dao decides that it doesnt want to do anything with tnl or a part of it forks the code to continue development under a separate org what ens deployment remains legitimate then even if the market happens to choose one over the other the reputation of the project at large is tarnishedthis could happen even if tnl decided otherwise it seems this would always be a problem if there is a dao and a web2 entity that is de facto not under the daos control
323774,the conclusion seems to be not to make arbitrary nonprofits that exist concurrently to the dao
323775,ens dao yes as for daos in general you cant say pepsico us not having control over some affairs in pepsico turkey is a limitation of llcs or companies daos like companiesfoundationsnatural persons will have control over a subset of a protocols functions treasury and contributors the general takeaway is to recognize what is under the control of the dao and what is not which will vary on a casebycase basis for every protocol
323776,some wise fren said put everything you can onchain cause unless you do it from day 0 it would be hard to do processes externally later on but a wiser fren said fuck daos pick ur poison
323777,gulps both
323778,you reconcile it by not excluding anyone from your productsprotocols because of what you think which is what he honored dont mix it with excluding people from your productsprotocols because of what you think which is what some are now trying to do to himdoing to him
323779,seems like awaiting on true colors to emerge after contentious or non politically correct views of influential members of daos is now the best method to determine whether a project is truly decentralized new definition of a dao when a shadow centralized decision maker does not emerge
323780,the litmus test for free speech is what happens to hated speech not to approved speech
323781,also remember that deplatforming started with nazis but now anyone can get banned from web2 for going against party line on covidsame will happen to web3
323782,im sure the timing of this is pure coincidence and the actors being hurt by what crypto upholds wont leverage these situations in their favor at allnever give them one inch of ground
323783,okok this is degrading again
323784,stop right here thanks
323786,seems like the dao web2 differences were touched upon everything above is clear now back to work
323787,just have to say i love the censorship of censorship discussion the benevolent dictator
323790,nan
323792,lobster llc is the company that provides support to lobsterdao know the difference
323793,theres a separate holding corp that manages the nfts too its a subsidiary of ivans steakhouse
323797,enough dumb comments we are moving on
323798,stop right here thanks
323799,yes yes
323800,could you recommend some resources to read up on in what sense you think hentai is anime art and not porn ive got my gf starting to worry with all that hentai popping up on my twitter time line ser genuinely curious
323802,
323803,hi all has anyone used stater before
323804,this is the story of every l1 some of us in 2018 who didnt grasp it all and believed it was me moved on and stopped w the narrative while moving goalposts others continue to larp into the normie world watch out for esg posts to pump shitcoins ai and stuff like that
323805,crypt0moon remember ccr perlin convos
323806,wont making the networks token stableish solve the problem
323807,did you load up gnosis chain bags
323808,sexy code rip my bags
323809,heh youre already familiar my stance on that chain or at least its history but success is failure when the only thing people can pay fees in can x100
323810,yes tragedy of the commons we been over it and i dunno if anybody has a good solution to it yet so i am not sure what we can be discussing even
323811,fk why did i start this
323812,lol make the supply 100x instead and youve solved the tragedy
323813,maybe we need a lottery system to let x many transactions go through for cheap
323814,anyone knows of a resource to show liveuptodate breakdown of dai backing
323815,isnt that just makerdao collateral mix
323816,yes cant seem to open their dashboard thoughedit nevermind got there eventually
323817,its actually interestingmost of the txs is bots unless we believe there are users spamming txs for 1000s of tpsso in a permissionless ledger how could you prevent bots or make it harder for spamming rate limit prioritize txs addresses just ignore the spam if you can somehow classify it add proof of work as a computational effort to each tx to slow down individual senders somewhat similar to increasing costs so not clear would this even be useful tbh no idea but eventually i believe people will find a solution otherwise we fooked
323818,doesnt solve block space issue gas war will bid it up despite gas being denominated in stables
323820,i built one free web application for getting the best value cryptos in long term and i was wondering if someone could check it and give some opinion suggestions
323821,the price of the fee denominator only matters short term so if eth or sol moons the fees will only moon for some days before the market can readjust and then the miners will be willing to accept cheaper txn ethdenominated because their cost basis is ultimately in usd
323822,i do not want to make spam
323823,any defi og can spare few mins to discuss two products i am looking at i just want to understand few things about them and sustainability of the product
323825,one lane for captcha solvers another for the rest
323826,is oke throw in here
323829,well not sure its that bad of an ideacaptcha is too much effort even for normal people but something that requires minimal human interaction but cant be botted seems certainly reasonableheck i use a hardware wallet right each tx i send requires me clicking several physical buttons and increases my latency by 12 seconds making stuff nearinstant but 100x cheaper might be a compromise worth thinking aboutnot sure exacly how and will drop this topic before ivan gets angry d
323831,ok there you have it some of you might be happy in future if you check it
323832,if you have doubts let me know i look forward for suggestions
323833,htppsfastestgrowingcryptocom
323834,
323835,sorry
323836,1good times in ccr back then despite unrealistic outlooksthis was before greed took overthings moved from trying to make things better for the common man to muh apy now muh expensive ape jpeg as welland when the more brilliant ones from back then started throwing out flawed code just because they could the degen bandwagon really started rollingits rolling downhill and the brakes are kaputtpurpose anyone
323837,if you are interested on how it works i would be happy to explain robots run every 24 hours analyzing all cryptos in the market
323838,i want to build the bot that will notify you directly in telegram about incoming messages what do you think
323839,good thing to have if there isnt any
323840,isnt that epns
323841,ivangbi ban the guy
323842,i can see some of you are checking the tool this is what you have to search for
323843,it shows tvl change per protocol or wut
323844,nan
323845,nan
323846,progressive beautiful increase in rank organic
323847,the tools detects those fast moving coins that grow fast in time before they come to the first positions
323848,and everybody notice them
323849,when the graph has not data for one day it means it was not listed winner that day
323850,the counter for the days winner is to avoid the pumps and dumps the more time the coin is listed winner the more organic the grow is supposed to be
323851,it shows by rank
323852,therefore capitalization
323853,i dont care about the price of the coin only how much money is dropped on it
323854,if a coin grows consinstenly in time i suppose it is for a reason therefore i can check that coin and investigate the project further
323855,for me many times i see a coin and i wonder where did it came from and how got there if i could have catched when it was in lower ranks for example
323856,is good but i saw only in browser
323858,in phone it should load too
323861,all the info for the robots comes from coingecko
323862,and all days all cryptos are comparedagainst the fixed date of 31012020
323864,or if the coin is listed new and we have no data
323865,the first day the coin was imported
323866,gotcha thanks clear thanks for explaining those who want can look into it
323867,thanks ivan
323868,and please send me feedback or other metrics to add to help
323869,in looking forward to hear and improve it
323870,filters would be nice for example to exclude big mcap coins
323871,thanks jorge i will take that in thinks to improve some filter to limit the range of market cap
323872,i added also google trend will also add the link to the project of the coin
323873,
323874,stop fud plz
323875,the thing with the filter is that i measure the change in capitalization if you add a filter for capitalization you might limit a coin that grew till that capitalization
323876,lazarus is financed for years by powned the central banks i let you imagine what they could do via solarwinds
323877,
323878,wonder how far 150m gets you in the cruise missile business for scale usaf estimates building a new fleet of cruise missiles 15bn
323880,its worth noting that south korean exchanges security is notoriously bad and they love to blame the north when they get hacked instead of taking reponsibility
323881,back in 201718 there was an audit of south korean exchanges that found that something like 50 operated on unprotected wifi
323883,because the default settings for south koreas most popular router brand back then didnt set a password
323884,tally does not support snapshot gov right
323885,nope its just a ui for governor alpha and bravo voting afaik
323886,and they may also have added aave governance recently
323887,i see a bunch of stuff that i thought only has snapshots see here
323888,like which projects
323889,ens unlsashed inverse indexed
323890,indexed inverse definitely not snapshot based
323891,
323892,nvm i am dumb
323893,haha fair enough there are so many governance frameworks out there
323894,ok smth more fun this cosmos farms and airdrops de fuk are they where
323895,theres one that everyone will receive evmos
323896,based on how much eth you spent on ethereum
323897,and certain bridge usage hop synapse connext etc
323898,is there a way to transfer nfts in bulk from wallet to wallet
323899,i voted by selling all my ens tokens bearish such gullible dao which can be bullied into anything in under 24 hours
323900,be grateful these people cant code because i totally see the idea of taking tokens away vibe well with them
323901,you can use opensea go to this endpoint accountselecttransfer
323902,cancel culture hits the daoverse
323903,iv heard it only allows up to 19 do u know if it can do more
323905,you dont pay employer tax contributions for people employed under a dao in zug right
323906,employed or being contracted by anyway maybe scbuergel knows but in general all legal and tax questions you get answers to online are always scam
323907,these are pretty amazing actually usually for atom stakers osmosis lps and juno stakers i have received more in aidrops than i originally invested only in the last couple of months
323908,and you didnt share scammer ban
323909,it was pretty rough for a while before this happend like i was 70 on my positions at some point
323910,70 down
323915,stop convo on all ens stuff on all politics couch legal like honestly fuck offeven if andre posts smth about it will erase his message
323916,nan
323917,on this day 2 years ago we broke 1 bn tvl in defi
323919,any theories as to why defipulse got abandoned since it used to be good but since defillama has really destroyed it
323920,
323921,other than the fact defipulse still cannot even get large protocol tvl correctly
323922,they just took the stance that defi was only on ethereum
323923,the same reason why coingecko took over cmc the old team got too lazy and felt enitled to the laurels of success they havent even noticed a new hungry team zoom past them and couldnt adapt
323928,shifted focus to their paid model api coupled with some this isnt real defi judgment on projects stopped responding to listing requests paid model didnt work out well either
323930,450m is a big raise
323933,not only that im sure the pricing is off
323934,this is sequoia india though not us
323935,
323936,jfc i only noticed it now thanks rted
323937,same thing thats their singapore office
323938,oh missed that part
323939,any particular difference though regulatory or anything else
323940,scbuergel wrt the point about mm fetching the balance of all your accounts it goes through the rpc set for the currently active network which is infura for ethereum right
323941,nan
323942,is it legit
323943,did julian mention it anywhereif not and im 99 sure he didnt not legit
323944,can still be legit a dao to support someone can in principle form without that person acknowledging it not endorsing this better check whos behind it
323945,crypto_mckenna
323946,well their twitter has this website
323947,i saw vitalik contributed
323948,julian and pak colloborated on the nft
323949,and they raised over 40m on juicebox
323950,the dao is just a vechile to bid on it
323951,nan
323952,all proceeds go to wau holland foundation for his defence
323953,gabriel shipton julians brother is part of assangedao
323954,
323955,hes literally on twitter space rn
323956,and probably a token like people
323957,what
323958,
323959,thank for infor
323960,
323961,the economist is significantly owned by lord rothschildthis is them making their move into the crypto power vacuum left behind by the bogdanoffs
323962,wondering if there will be a token like constitution dao at some point airdrop for that was like 150k worth for 1 eth contributors
323963,yes
323964,called justice
323965,people donate eth to juicebox and get a proportional share of the justice governance token
323966,thats the reason why people are aping it so much lmfao
323967,theres a very good cause aswell you apes
323968,apes want gainz
323969,definitely love the cause
323970,awesome
323971,will freeassange moon there was the freeross token but it didnt really hold momentum after token sent out how would they pull off a constitutiondao type moon
323972,having fun james_waugh
323973,fuqqqqqqqq lmfao
323974,
323975,what the fuck is pawtocol
323976,great grandson of petscom from 199s
323977,the same question
323978,1999
323979,joel go back to work or we cancel you
323980,okbye
323981,depends on how you do it a dao is not a legal entity usually you have an llc in switzerland thats ag or gmbh and employ people there for which you have to pay pension and other social contributions iirc we pay about 20 in total on top of salary
323982,dentacoin for pets
323983,nan
323984,lol lol
323985,is this so they can target ads at my dog
323986,yes correct through currently connected provider by default infura can link all your accounts yes including my scbuergeleth and all my anon and shit token airdrop accounts and no i have no reason to believe they do not log all that and forward it to good ol uncle sam
323987,so in addition to the browser profile stuff you mentioned changing your rpc at least for ethereum from ethereum to some generic nonapikeyed provider would be useful
323988,ameen is the cameraman
323989,hes usually in the videos no
323990,ideally your own full node yes
323991,can be
323992,
323993,wat means ser i thought we were waiting for sec to give permission for etf not nasdaq or is this bitcoin miners etf kosher because its an index of stonksthe application thats been filed with the sec suggests its awaiting official notice of issuance
323994,any downsides if the node is fully synced
323995,well running an ethereum main net full node isnt suuuper cheap but if you can afford to pay for gas you can afford a hardware node p like 600 or so and you gotta keep it up and running just beware even that isnt perfect because mm is still querying opensea and etherscan and those also learn your ethereum address and your ip address aka where you live but its a lot better already
323996,hmm ok so saves from infura but not the others regarding running a full node i find it not very hard as most say although i already have a pc the cost was just 300 for a 2tb ssd
323997,musalbas dm
323998,
323999,this is a lot of voting damn wtf wow
324000,
324001,vesta stable something something
324002,something going on with magic eden right now
324003,some guy is apparently terrorizing them to prove a point apparently their launchpad hasnt been doing adequate kycaccount verifications and some dude is taking advatage of it to launch rugs
324004,yikes i think magiceden did something about the original rug refund iirc
324005,they did refund participants but the guy is saying he has stake in some way of other projects yet to be launched seems like a vendetta idk
324006,he also posted some offensive comments about the founders before rerugging the balloonville twitter i wont repost here because its just garbo bs not sure what his deal is
324007,someone used 30m gas to mint an nft called vanity blocks when was the last time an eth block had only 1 tx
324008,nan
324009,it is a vanityblock
324010,how poetic
324011,i wonder if this is a coming trend definitely got i am rich vibes
324012,ok thats one block nft project too many now lol
324014,lets move it to nft ave
324017,are there any reliable mixers for solana
324018,oxmaki are you helping develop vesta
324019,thanks i was trying to go for that u guys are welcome to visit us vanityblocks
324020,
324021,ivangbi has blocked me from visiting anyone until i send one longform out every few days so cant do but thanks
324022,so 0xmaki is in an advisory role
324023,correct
324024,thoughts as is a subject that resurface from time to time
324025,i dont help develop it but i am closely advising nick thread on twitter is accurate
324026,thanks for clarifying glad to have you back in some capacity youve been missed
324027,more coming extremely soon
324028,water tiger year is bullish fren
324029,
324031,indeed
324032,is there a tps limit imposed by the evm i am researching this new chain thundercore in their docs they state 2000 tps and on their website they claim 4000 tps orus claim 4000 so i am wondering how they can claim the same throughput as a sytem where computational resources are unbound by the blockchain
324033,i guess it would come down to block size since at the end of the day isnt that what gives the evm turing completeness if a blockchain has a huge blocsize then more computation could be included per block
324034,you can remove computation completely if you treat the blockchain as a data layer think zkrollup and then it depends on the time it would take blocks to reach majority and getting and aggregating their signatures
324035,do we have any idea what their burn rate is surprising theyd raise so huge unless they are burning 100s of millions edit answered my own question 100m for ecosystem fund the rest is 35 years of burn rate which seems like a long horizon to raise for
324036,someone here wanted to do this i wonder if they managed to eventually execute it
324037,they did it was monkeyontheloose
324039,id love to collab with lobs got tons of help here can mint one for the dao at gas cost open to ideas
324040,
324041,congratulations on making this happen
324042,and for figuring out how to get a block all to yourself
324044,might have to wait for block 151065739
324045,what is special about this block
324046,15lobster
324048,have any projects started offering ve token mechanic implementation as a service
324049,the gas price you pay for transactions is independent of the l1 gas token price we had that discussion here dozens of times or are you shitposting
324050,there are some correlations since chain being successful block space expensive chain being successful l1 coin going up but no causation
324051,hey guys is there a good internship platform for defidao except for web3 careers one
324052,get involved with any protocol maybe start as a chat mod
324053,following transactions for support tickets is a good start
324054,thanks for the tip will do
324055,pro tip what youre experiencing could possibly beill forward this to the dev team
324056,most of the time its a matter of the user needing to refresh the page youll get harder cases that will help you along the way
324058,cb keep doing shameless stuff
324059,are there any successful dexs which have issued their tokens through taker fee rebates most token distrobution is done through lps staking in for a fixed amount of tokens over a given period but this can result in overpaying for liquidity has anyone tried fee rebates where the taker is refunded a portion of the fees they paid in the form of the token
324060,
324061,dov users were doing a research and would love your input
324062,how would you incentivize the lps to stake the tokens that are swapped
324067,from the fees paid by traders or you use a mixture of lp incentives and trading rebatesim not saying that all tokens would need to be distributed by means of the fee rebate but you could use a mixture of the two and use governance to balance i guess what i was thinking was that taker fee rebates would only be paid out for economic activity rather than passive deployment of capital while it may work on a cex i would think there are issues with maintaining proper pricing for the fee rebate this type of variable distrobution is more open to attack vectors than just issuing tokens in a staking contract at a fixed rate
324068,well generally the fees are paid to the liquidity providers that staked their tokens on the dex this is their reward for parking the tokens on the dex the taker only acts when a swap is believed to be worthwhile so an additional incentive isnt needed per se if we play it out toward your idea and say a rebate was offered it would be necessarily small and would increase the cost of the gas for the transaction to manage this rebate and that added cost might be as high or higher than the swap smart contract itself but even if this was on an l2 or cheap l1 the rebate value would likely be tiny the cost of exchanging that rebate token wouldnt likely be worthwhile if someone conducts many such transactions on a low gas chain it could be possible for rebate tokens to have an aggregate value but it would still be less than anything that liquidity providers receive from swap fees its probably not going to be a good model and certainly not a sustainable one for all these reasons
324069,yes in almost all cases takers pay for their volumes i guess its just a matter of what you think is more important volume or liquidity volume can be inflated but the fees paid remain constant as a of tx size with lp the funds sit there until someone needs them
324070,web3 space probably took a wrong turn at some point
324071,
324072,lmao
324073,woke3 more like it
324074,quick we need to write a script to archive all potentially harmful words ct accounts used just to make sure noone escapes
324075,and people were laughing just yesterday when i said its an existential threat
324076,the person they are targeting
324077,decentrazlieed
324079,must mint nfts of all offensive ct tweets quick ensure that they are non transferrable as to avoid profiting from them
324084,
324085,the worst thing is its likely because she got caught up in the ens stuff supporting the cancellerssomeone likely combed through her history to check after this
324086,
324095,wokeism needs to stop contracts are not racist contracts dont care
324096,lets enjoy some forbidden music
324103,what did the person say
324104,any contect
324105,use of word retard i believe
324106,lmfaoooooooo
324107,the horror off with her head
324108,wokies eating themselves is funny tbh but obv feel bad her
324109,she self cancelled dont
324110,all she said was thiswoke people probably dont even know these are rap lyrics
324116,where is ivan to end this conversation
324121,there is a major celebritysocialite who was cancelled years ago for quoting kanyes nis in paris so its nothing new
324124,hey yall would anyone know a wallet browser plugin that acts like an injected wallet but is actually connected via walletconnect basically i want to connect to a dapp via walletconnect when they only support metamask
324125,id like to see some daos do the opposite and vote to onboard ashni and brantly despite not sharing their political and religious opinions best outcome
324138,how about we start here
324139,would like to know if this is actually a thing or a pipe dream
324140,ledger live desktop works using walletconnect if you use ledger from my memory
324141,doesnt seem like its what i am looking for but ill take a look thanks
324142,nan
324143,on desktop ledger live you paste the wallet connect url and it will connect
324144,i dont think it does it used to used usb2 which chromium blocked due to some crypto security issue in chromium 91 not sure how their current work around works but doubt its wallet connect
324145,it does allow it you have to manually do it
324146,metamask direct connection by default uses hid
324147,if you want walletconect though check the screenshot i just shared
324148,ok yes i see what you mean i am looking a wallet where u would import your wallet via walletconnect and then connect to daps via injection
324149,kind of like reversing the process
324150,i see you want extensionbrowser over injected and then extensionmobile using walletconnect
324151,yes where the seed phrase and all signing is done on the mobile
324152,try rabby
324153,
324154,oh the debank wallet sure i will check it out thanks
324155,yes that allows for your usecase
324156,you can read here
324157,as you can see many of the devs are poorly prepared for targeted attacks imo its on topic
324158,nice wallet and does have the walletconnect feature thanks again
324159,how do you advise them to get ready for it do you worry about it yourself
324162,there should be a dao for that
324163,someone fund me
324164,
324166,fuck this is the best
324167,duckdegen this u
324170,shes speaking
324173,redacted a bunch of shit gm
324178,and thats redacted not retarded
324181,ok now for the retarded ones stop typing go do your work you can read above and listen but this convo is over go cancel your moms kisses x
324184,nan
324186,man someone just exploited qi dao those guys are great builders been working hard across multiple chains and aave
324187,how much and how need tldr
324189,looks like 7 mil but think team is asleep maybe one of the aave guys can wake them up pinged the devs in dm
324190,whats super matic not that familiar with matic system is that from a third party
324191,superfluids been exploited
324192,20m mai i think
324193,you can track the adress of the dumper
324194,not sure if he has multiple accounts
324195,
324196,damnnnn
324198,dont look at the moca chart
324199,qi is quite popular on polygon right
324200,not only on polygon
324201,didnt exact to see it on this bot alert
324202,usually its all bsc rugs
324203,was it superfluid that got hacked
324204,looks like it yes
324205,superfluid vesting contract
324206,ouch
324207,confirmed
324208,is this a buy the dip situation
324209,not sure hacker still has 10m
324210,he has 94m more in his wallet looking for exit liquidity so id say no
324211,since qi if safe maybe but apparently hackers holds more
324212,and there could be a snapshot
324213,yeah not yet
324214,dont think jump is involved
324215,he holds 16 of the total supply now fdv doesnt seem healthy
324216,he cant really dump anymore id therefore expect a snapahot new token
324217,isnt qi based around a maker vault system tho
324218,how would they migrate the collateral to a new token
324219,its multiple chain and a lot of different protocols doubt they would do a snapshot after he sold most already maybe hes got 3 of the supply left
324220,it is
324221,have you seen any repos with or posts about e2e testing crosschain interactions with hardhat seems like i would need to fork multiple networks at the same time
324222,the collateral is fine the problem is with the governance token
324223,they just hacked all the team and i guess investors vesting
324224,as a founder of data indexing project i completely agree with this we pay huge infrastructure fees its quite difficult to directly access nodes data in real time as it needs more processing to make it granular hence you have to keep the data in centralized dbs which increases the cost as well as makes it more centralized if we try to decentralize it by having more people to host these centralized dbs and having validation on top of it the cost increases significantly but having said all this asking each dapp to develop their own indexers is too much of an ask it takes a quite a bit of learning curver to understand the internals of blockchain to implement a proper indexer and an army to maintain it especially if youre indexing a chain like bsc and solana kudos to graph that they took the subgraph approach but there is necessity of data even for people who are not smart contract developers thats where these balancers transactions etc will help and also subgraph requires people to write code even for trivial requirements unmarshal is currently testing a no code auto indexing tool for smart contracts with built in support for price token details notifications analytics and apis hopefully it solves many issues discussed here
324225,oh whoops got them confused ty
324226,if its really team investor tokens then it will get interesting to watch whos taking the loss in the end
324227,maybe they will create another gov token and distribute depending on the holders prev to hack
324228,hacker dumped all qi mabe time for apeing now
324229,yup why
324230,are deposit assets on maifinance at risk too
324231,no
324232,it was a hack to superfluid not to qi or mai
324233,is the hack only specific to those vesting contracts or is there a possibility for others to also be compromised
324234,if its a superfluid hack why arent more streams being compromised
324235,there are
324236,large oof
324237,see here
324238,holy shit ok thats big
324239,i ambulance chased on qi great team theyll build back
324241,im with you on that
324242,i am with you bro
324243,it appears it was the teams owned vested tokens that were stolen not users thats a twist
324244,was there any user token on superfluid at all
324245,i think someone said it was team and early investors i assume they had long term vesting
324246,got it weird early stage investors didnt get affected
324247,is the circulating supply of 61mm qi accurate or not anymore
324248,unless you deposited by hand no
324249,i think early investors probably got rekt too
324250,they prob had the same vesting
324251,
324252,i mean hes not wrong about them being effectively the same vs the more lofty claims but that it doesnt manage to hit that upper end in what would be ideal conditions is a tad impressive
324253,maybe those conditions arent that idealas per the team also in the document their tests did see over 50 and 50 is a lower boundtbh hot stuff can get to 150 or so which is the intrashard concensus
324254,as per the teamnot sure if you dont realize it but those claims dont count for much if anything they should spend more time getting the next audit done and hoping the result is favorable than making claims
324262,as we can see polygon hacker address just stopped performing any tx blacklist by polygon possible
324263,wait what
324264,
324265,this doesnt say anything
324266,etherscan gives warnings for suspected exploit addys as well
324267,oh yes i just saw its not suspended but suspected guess havent fully woke up yet anyway the address stopped performing any transactions
324268,that doesnt mean he cant do transactions because he was blocked by polygon from doing transactions he might be eating or went outside for groceries
324270,i am not sure how large the validator set is but it would be trivial to block transactions from that account
324271,a lot harder impossible to do with ethereum
324272,you might want to edit this i mean they could make the validators update their nodes and blacklist the address by making them not accept the txs from that account but im not sure how doable is that on a short notice but thats a horrible idea imo
324273,wow lol that sounds painful it would be probably cheaper for polygon to cover the hacked funds trashing the whole network to stop 10m from being spent could be literally the worse solution imaginable
324274,polygon should do nothing with the qi bribes starting up the market should eventually bid up the price exploits happen every daay b strengthening the overall ecosystem
324275,this is not a polygon problem and would set a dangerous precendent that you can ship buggy code massive generalisation i know it was likely an extremely complex edge case etc etc and offload responsibility for it to someone else who will make good
324276,now if it was a problem that was core to the chain itself absolutely they should step in
324279,theyve not done it again though after multiple multimillion exploits and that wasnt a bailout that was a full on ctrlz
324280,well then it exist with the recent wormhole bailout just saying that it would not be the first time something like that happens in the space not saying it shouldmy point is that those things are not to be seen as precedents either way since they are individual decisions they mainly occur if there is too much at stake for big parties
324281,hi guys can you please send me some guide how to create farm or dex
324282,u went from searching for a platform to sell a shitcoin to now needing a pool 2
324283,if youre asking for a guide for it you probably shouldnt build it
324284,lol why you so toxic guys
324285,its not toxic if you are a shitty dev you should not be handling others peoples money with your code
324286,goal of the audit isnt to be favorable and these audits dont need to be public its public as per request of the team and the goal wasnt to test performance claims but rather securitynow lets jump to my questionwhich protocols took an external audit and moreover which protocols did a public stress test to show their claimed performance meets the promisesas far as im aware none have done any form of open security audit and all have reached congestion at tps much lower than what they have publicly talked about but yeah lets ignore this lol
324287,this is a little blunt but largely correct please spend some time considering how you might feel if something goes terribly wrong smart contract development is not for everyone start with securethorg fork mainnet and play around with that instead
324288,jump trading plugging that eth hole has nothing to do w a hard fork of a blockchain
324292,hardfork and bailout are absolutely different things
324297,this convo is weird lets end pointless
324298,never said it was to be favorable so many words based on a misunderstanding ganbareits public per the request of the teamstop telling stories ser even in the chat you have this jepsen always make their reports public radix did know this from start
324299,aaaand end next time monthly mutes to both take radix stuff away love you
324300,legit enough is enough this is 7th time asking to take it away
324301,any efficient solution to follow a value change in a smart contract when the method doesnt trigger event
324304,have u tried using tenderlyco alerts i described it in article
324305,no i will check it thanks
324312,does curve has any plans to support zkwallet
324313,you mean zksync wallet why would it zksync 20 is around the corner and its an evm chain
324314,
324315,the fuck is this
324316,gotta say india does have a lot of potential
324317,the reason for not verifying is primarily to protect game ip and make it harder to clone verification for defi makes sense when user deposits liquid assets like usdceth our game contract only allows crab deposit in gamefi half the games do stuff offchain as is its same as not verifying the analogy here is whether anyone would play a game without having access to its source codeultimately not verifying is in the best interest of players who dont want to see their game get blatantly copied
324318,is there anywhere that accepts univ2 or univ3 tokens as collateral such that i could borrow dai against my lp tokens cream seems to have disabled these markets and everything else ive found warp impermax etc have very low or just zero tvl abracadabra which only has those two curve pools and hasnt added anything new in months am i the only one around here who wants to use lp tokens as collateral or is there another market that im missing out on
324319,the aave amm market supports some uni v2 lp and bpt tokens but there isnt much to borrow theres 700000 in dai avail there
324320,does anyone know if radial has ruggedi say rugged loosely cos i think the only thing they can rug is the dre nft
324321,they seem to be building nft still inside z wallet nothing new announced whatevs for now
324322,
324323,wtf is this
324324,
324325,0 info just fundraising
324326,house hearing on stablecoins among others now live
324327,
324328,to help daos with liquidityas in they a just give a part of the 18million to the daos or b help daos that have liquidity
324329,maybe justincbram knows seems like ondo narrative
324330,love me some give me money because i wrote a cumulative 2 pages and ripped off the other 4
324331,just the state
324332,oh spartan invested
324333,lemme ask for deck 1 min
324334,wild credit does afaik
324335,yeah it seems like an ondo soft fork possibly some tokemak elements thrown in
324336,warp finance has been working on this for over a year now should be out by the end of this month heard this before thoughtheir final audit with trail of bits has taken forever
324337,is openzeppelin defender any good or is it better to build a similar pipeline inhouse
324338,maker themselves have uni v2 markets to borrow dai
324339,tho might be empty
324340,anyone here gonna be at eth denver
324343,is that a thing again everythings been online for so long
324344,happening next week
324345,i had a lot of fun in 2018
324346,been doing research on the syndicate platform for forming investment daoswith syndicate daos members can have real ownership of noncrypto assets irl if they dox for crypto only no doxxing needed they use latham watkins a big law firm but in terms of doxxing for owning noncrypto assets dont forget an llc instead of individual could own a share in dao to preserve privacy signatory authorized person who signs documents on behalf of llc for that llc could be someone other than you like a lawyerin real life especially for commercial real estate transactions it is also quite common for one llc to act as the managing member of another llc signing documents and acting on behalf of itthus if you wish to participate in numerous investment daos you could invest via one or multiple llcs and you could use that llc to access both crypto and noncrypto opportunities without necessarily doxxing or disclosing your individual identitymany possibilities
324347,do you know any already existing investment daos
324349,please google i guess flamingo meta cartel and a bunch others daoa are not very good at investing though its either a gp style who are then lowkey like a traditional vc or people get lazy imho
324350,thanks and maybe you know how early protocol private deals happen is it usually through llc or some kind of promisesc to give of tokens
324351,i wonder what daos will look like when theyre actually functional
324352,i remember there was also something called a lao at one point limited access organization it was an investment dao that only accepted 100 total members with a large minimum contribution
324353,dont remember what it was called though
324354,it still exists and has a pretty large portfolio in addition it has birthed spin offs like flamingo that manage 1b aum
324355,whats it called
324356,good to hear it seemed to work out for em
324357,i remember looking at it in its infancy over a year ago seemed like quite an interesting concept
324358,there are many but most only invest in crypto assetsone important point is that if you have a dao that invests in crypto and say a physical store where people slip and fall and routinely injure themselves it might be better to break that into two separate daos this way any crypto assets are segregated and cannot be accessed if someone fell inside the physical store and sued the dao entity
324359,they have the lao flamingo dao reddao another dao for zed run etc
324360,
324362,this was the 120k btc correct
324363,
324364,ilya lichtenstein 34 and his wife heather morgan 31 both of manhattan
324365,what is the easiest way to create a bunch of cosmos addresses keplr doesnt allow generating extra addresses for one mnemonic
324366,looking at socials think this is the ilya lichtenstein
324367,pretty active up until a month ago
324368,nan
324369,lol he worked for some project that was intended to fight cybercrime too
324370,just goes to show never trust men named after entire countries
324371,sounds about right
324372,hope so you in comms with the team ivan their discord is dead would be nice for them to interact a little
324373,and the wife
324374,this is really loool they were pretty deep in the crypto mix
324375,what happens to leo now they buy it all back and return the funds
324376,scammers even got their own eth
324377,
324378,suspicious leo up quite significantly this week
324379,not going to say there was insire knowledge but someone started buying a ton of leo in the run up to this arrest announcement
324380,
324381,someone did hint at some onchain action suggesting the recovery tho exactly a week ago
324382,
324383,perfect meme
324385,
324386,lmao at her pinned tweet
324387,lost most of the gains already
324388,if you start tracing their eth ens through the accounts they used to fund the wallets youll find connections to other eth ens quite interesting
324389,one of those wallet cluster analysis would come in handy for this one
324390,
324391,according to court documents lichtenstein and morgan allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of 119754 bitcoin that were stolen from bitfinexs platform after a hacker breached bitfinexs systems and initiated more than 2000 unauthorized transactions those unauthorized transactions sent the stolen bitcoin to a digital wallet under lichtensteins control over the last five years approximately 25000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of lichtensteins wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by lichtenstein and morgan the remainder of the stolen funds comprising more than 94000 bitcoin remained in the wallet used to receive and store the illegal proceeds from the hack after the execution of courtauthorized search warrants of online accounts controlled by lichtenstein and morgan special agents obtained access to files within an online account controlled by lichtenstein those files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet that directly received the funds stolen from bitfinex and allowed special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94000 bitcoin that had been stolen from bitfinex the recovered bitcoin was valued at over 36 billion at the time of seizure
324392,
324393,the arrested couple is kinda known in startup ecosystem exyc etc
324394,
324395,
324396,those guys gotta have earned a one way ticket to jail there
324397,those files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet that directly received the funds stolen from bitfinex and allowed special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94000 bitcoin that had been stolen from bitfinexare you joking me these guys got ian balinad
324398,huge theft money laundering fraud
324399,hiding in plain sight
324400,thought bali was common knowlege
324401,the big question how did they decrypt the files
324402,
324403,in 2021 agents obtained a copy of the contents of the cloud storage account pursuant to a search warranton or about january 31 2022 law enforcement was able to decrypt several key files contained within the account
324404,asked google to do it im sure
324405,how so
324407,lol basically does this mean the feds can rug the market now
324408,no the funds will have to be returned to their owners
324409,its stolen property itll go back to bitfinex
324410,those coins belong to bitfinex yeah
324411,further an amount equal to at least 80 ofrecovered net funds from the bitfinex hack willbe used to repurchase and burn outstanding leotokens within 18 months from the date ofrecovery
324412,from leo whitepaper
324413,so they were going to sell their bag in the middle of the bear market what a paperhands move
324414,it was all fun and games music until 3 days ago
324415,so theyre gonna use it to pump leo
324418,all am looking for someone with deep familiarity with the namecoin blockchain i know that is random as hell i have a client that has requested an experts opinon on functionality of the protocol does anyone on here fit the bill
324419,amazing so feds are gonna pump a shitcoin to the moon
324422,buybacks dont work like people think they do besides leo mcap already increased todays by more than 35b and bitcoin will dumpfast in anticipation of this fire saleso no
324423,probably until 31jan and the last one was a programmed tweet
324424,i much prefer this drama to yesterdays drama ct is a real rollercoaster
324425,never a dull day in crypto this should be a reality show
324426,id start with blockstack team they were originally based on namecoin iirc
324427,thanks any suggestions on best ways to get in touchspecific person to contact
324428,lose 9 figures one week gain back 10 figures the next
324429,well if they stick to their word theyve got to be repurchased from somewhere and theyre all circulating and according to gecko the leo pairs have less than 100k 2 depth so market cap has moved that much on less than 10m volume
324430,
324431,good shillz
324432,lol shameless
324433,the criminal complaint alleges that lichtenstein and morgan employed numerous sophisticated laundering techniques including using fictitious identities to set up online accounts utilizing computer programs to automate transactions a laundering technique that allows for many transactions to take place in a short period of time depositing the stolen funds into accounts at a variety of virtual currency exchanges and darknet markets and then withdrawing the funds which obfuscates the trail of the transaction history by breaking up the fund flow converting bitcoin to other forms of virtual currency including anonymityenhanced virtual currency aec in a practice known as chain hopping and using usbased business accounts to legitimize their banking activity
324434,xaya is a fork of namecoin too if you cant reach out to namecoins devs you could try them i dont have a contact
324435,our tether is backed now
324436,
324437,bitfinexed is going to have a field day with this one
324438,nan
324439,you joke but i now sleep easier
324440,was there already a post mortem about superfluid exploit
324441,or did someone find out what made it possible
324442,the best place to hide a tree is in a forest only goes so far lol
324443,
324444,im sure itll start to get addressed with v3 but moloch is super hard to get running efficiently trustlessly if youre investing on the same terms as trad vcs still needs quite a big trust element and some clever accounting around vested tokens vs ragequit
324445,the darknet stuff sounds like they might get the ulbricht treatment
324446,here is the statement of facts about the caseand the complaint
324447,
324448,
324449,ivangbi dear lobster lord ive been asked by community to invite on my voice chat in telegram to spread the info about lovely gearbox if you wish we could discuss date and time in pm
324450,shilling yes ok lets
324451,let the memes beginis this bear market confirmed though
324452,i dont think so
324454,likewise
324455,no need for memes lol
324456,guys i have a complex question i want to protect my downside while still having crypto as collateral so i could unlock it if crypto rises singnificantly so im doing this
324457,i provide half btc half eth to aave then i borrow money to invest in tricrypto
324458,now the main question should i borrow dollars from aave or should i borrow 33btc33eth33usd
324459,hate to be that guy but putting part of your crypto on a cex and shorting a coinmargined futures would get you the desired outcome a lot cheaper
324460,
324461,nan
324462,i just dont understand how you are capable of hacking your way into a cex to steal 94k btc and then go ahead and store all the private keys in a single file on google drive
324464,i would bet us govt auctions btc to institutional types then asks bitfinex for full list of ppl affected then theyll pay them after they come forward and prove who they are via kyc
324465,tim draper in line already im guessing lol
324466,
324467,
324468,ded
324469,actually impressive that it took 6 years for them to get caught
324470,
324471,pls mint nft
324472,nan
324473,how is it possible its really these two this seems like a front
324474,it is not that unlikely 2016 everything was still kind of provisional and sometimes people just get an opportunity and run with it whatever happened here those people are clearly not mentally capable of handing the situation they got themselves into front or not
324475,she prob banged bitfinex guy and stole info needed looks like prostitute turned wife type to me
324476,if you listen to her rap backwards she spells out the private keys
324477,definitely not criminal mastermind
324478,their opsec is pretty fucking bad north korea would not have fucked this up
324479,lolol
324480,shes being used thats for sure but the guy might to be connected to vinnik
324481,easy tiger no need to go after her like that
324483,nan
324484,i wonder if one of them is in this group
324485,the thing is that them being a front of some sort does not make much sense either whats the point in sending two idiots to jail and losing all the hacked funds
324486,i think the biggest pitfall of public assesstment of hacks is the idea that hackers who pull of large hacks are autmatically geniuses
324487,this is true they found 1 exploit line and took it they might be tard otherwise
324488,nan
324489,too much money to clean burn it framing someone you hate and yolo
324490,or they are 300iq and this whole exposure of them being tards is a 3d chess move to make the world think theyre puppetstoo dumb
324491,what a terrible time to have ears
324493,and its a meticulously planned trail of tiktoks and digital footprints of them being retarded
324494,its really hard to live a normal life and maintain a clean opsec trail
324495,feel like that kind of depends on how much you want to offset your online persona from irl endeavours
324496,its not a gradient you either completely disconnect your laundering from your real life or you get caught there is no in between law enforcement only needs one thread usually to unravel the rest all it takes is one transaction or one slip up to lead them to the rest of the information that can allow them to connect and then prosecute
324497,oh yeah i agree with that i thought u were talking about general opsec also for lets say 0xanon devs
324498,im guessing ilya probably figured out how to hack bitfinex but then had zero idea how to launder the money his half hearted attempts to do so over the years left a long paper trail as seen in the fact docs
324500,
324501,ya
324502,could also have to do with the fact that a hack is much harder to prove than money laundering
324503,theres like 20k btc still out in the wild
324504,i know of a case where ordinary schoolboy hackers bought stealer logs worth 15 with thousands of bitcoins on it stolen from bitcoin cash core dev its a onceinalifetime thing but it happens everything is possible i cannot say anything for sure here
324506,oxngmi u forgot to log off from ur zachxbt alt jk why did you decide to point to that case imho i agree with this just didnt see you policing before luv it
324507,well because it directly affects defillama
324508,
324509,didnt the maple team come out and say they were watching deposits to safegaurd against this
324510,in september i was worried that their incentives and uncollateralized loans would lead to fake tvl since you can just borrow uncollateralized and deposit right back
324511,we discussed this whole maple situation recently basically it happened at least once however if done a little less obviously going through cex instead of just using the same wallet direcently there is no way to prove that it has not happened more often
324512,and they answered to me directly that this was not a big potential problem tweet i quoted was a direct reply to me i trusted them and listed with the full tvl to avoid giving them an disadvantage against other lending platforms well now i just found out that this had been happening they knew about it and just straight up told me that it was a potential problem
324514,wait you still in stables that would explain the recent pump xd
324515,
324516,
324519,brian explaining why they are listing dogshitwhy we list absolute dogshitits legal to list any asset whatever it isok this argumentation line works because they canwill list anything but why do you not list decent stuffbecause we are busy listing dogshit
324520,because its less risky to list dogshit
324521,dogshit 100 not security
324522,they want to list everythinglow risk to medium risk to high riskso first they will list all the dog shit before they get to decent coins that are medium risk
324523,public listed company needs to be super carefulkind of shows that being publicly listed stock and in crypto doesnt work
324524,it is just a matter of time until this becomes about more than the asset being a potential security even if those coins are not securities cb is a vital part in a scheme that has no other goal than extracting capital from retailers in a predatory way take shib for example it did nothing but taking money from retail in a blatant pump and dump likely orchestrated by the same parties who paid for the cb listing i am not in favor of regulation but if they want to look at something this should be it instead of harassing actual defi projects that are trying to build something
324525,fully agree with you they are feeding their users scams and putting them at risktheir policy already had serious impacts o their launch volumesome of their recent opening volumes were smaller then gateio
324526,problem with that line of reasoning is it insinuates the people socalled retail buying these things are blameless children that were misled when the reality isnt so generous
324527,i am just following the line of argument the regulators themselves have put in place not agreeing with it meaning that if they were serious about protecting retail this would be something to act onthe point is essentially that those blatant pumps and dumps on coinbase are way more easy to access for someone you might call retail than uniswap or any other defi protocol is during the shib pump the coinbase app was in the top 10 downloads of the appstore if i recall right people can buy into this stuff without ever seeing a chart the supplymarketcap or even having to understand those most basic concepts yet this is apparently regulatory safe enough for coinbase not having to worry about it
324528,yeah unfortunately it does follow
324529,nan
324530,
324531,
324532,
324533,
324534,lol
324535,is austin griffith the scaffoldeth guy here
324536,have his own tg group
324537,link
324538,
324539,
324540,what is the scammer up to
324541,where is the follow up
324542,when new promise larp
324543,accumulating mass
324544,where are anibus updates too i understand things have been filed was there anything new on that front
324545,true metaverse
324546,aave liquidates just as much as needed to return to normal health factor or they liquidate a huge chunk immediately
324547,last i checked only euler has soft liquidations but has been a while since i checked
324548,whats your oracle implementation do you account crosspool twaps aka if ethdai has 4 fee tier pools created do you weight in every pool
324549,maybe check tiktok
324550,up to 50 of debt
324551,and what happens in practice is there data on that
324552,hi i tried to dig the internet but couldnt get my hands on the new dusk testnet new launch date so im trying my luck here does anyone have an idea on when the dusk daybreak new testnet launch date will be the last set date was 122022 but they discovered a critical bug and post poned there must be a new set date but cannot find that when are they attempting it again so if anyone knows this i would appreciate it cheers
324553,even more bizarre part of the finex dramaheather wrote a 2014 btc fud post
324554,
324555,we use a single fee pool for the oracle adding extra pools adds very little additional security in practice but would lead to quite a bit of extra gas were open sourcing this tool soon tells you the cost of manipulating various uni v3 twap oracles over 1 or more blocks
324556,there is no reason to believe 50 of debt isnt taken whenever possiblesomeone taking only 25 is leaving the liquidation reward on the table for the other 25
324557,in contrast euler allows liquidations to bring a users health score back to 125 much softer in most cases reducing effective cost of borrowing on euler especially when coupled with our dutch auction liquidation bonus approach which limits fees paid to liquidatorsminers
324558,
324559,live right now sers
324560,it does add more accuracy on the pricing for longtail assets which increases the security of not having liquidations occur when they shouldnt
324561,the quote is being done on borrow right if so the gas cost is practically negligent more if you are performing a borrow on eth mainnet
324563,
324564,if an asset is so long tail that its pools are not being arbitraged immediately when pricing differences emerge then its probably not suitable yet for lending and borrowing volatility is the least of your worries
324565,not volatility rather the ability to manipulate the pool generally projects add fullrange positions on a certain pool but not on all the pools
324566,olympus is the only one who actually sell someone else bonded liquidity with olympus pro or they have a real competition somewhere im not talking about forks who bond and sell own tokens
324567,theres a bunch of ways to decrypt a volume without statelevel resources wrote a short thread on it here
324568,
324569,looks like they may get released on bond unbelievable
324570,loop does this on terra
324571,socean streams is about to launch on solana
324573,whats the circulating supply of qi after the exploit yesterday im aware 19mm qi is now on the market but is the circulating supply of 61mm accurate
324574,sharing for the lulz delete if inappropiate ivangbi
324575,dies aanyone know of a way to export eth transactions to pdf etc
324576,i did manage to do it before how can i help
324577,did you use a tool
324578,anyone saw tech reviews of evms on l1s aurora moonbeamevmos neon
324579,there is a javascript library for it
324580,works well with react
324581,
324582,can you provide an example use case for this
324583,you can always export etherscan tx as csvimport to google sheetsexcelsave as pdf
324584,
324585,you posted this tweet not because you hold a bag but because you like design right
324586,its not your first day in here so guess which one it is
324587,i do like liquity and lp a lot in there so multicoll liquity is ofc a natural idea
324588,my question would be does the model require a large stability pool before calling it kinda safe cause what happens if your liquidations in the stability pool are not enough you can still go into external markets right
324589,and no i didnt ask these questions before aping obviously
324590,
324591,i think they need to provide naratives right crypto illegal stuffisnt this what they want to push for mainstream
324592,
324593,it uses v2 manifest you will have to compile and load it manually
324594,what does that solana pay thingy actually do whats the innovation does it just send usdc to a qr code by using irl service provider or what does it do
324595,every weirdo on twitter seems to be excited no clue why
324596,i think it just transfers usdc from your wallet to merchant account
324597,oh and also drop some sorta nft in your wallet related to the purchase
324598,i think legitimateleverage ftx and future product of sam that might replace visa and connect more ppl into solana ecosystem
324599,good ux is valuable in itself though
324600,details here
324601,making a payment with scanning qr has worked in 2014
324602,what i dont understand is how they are settling it in merchants account
324603,banks are not fast at settling transactions
324604,ye it might be the innovation because apart from it nothingburger
324605,no way you can go and update banks infra lol
324606,and if you dont that it cannot be fixed
324607,upi is working seamlessly in india
324608,ye so i am was just saying not see the ux argument fiveboroughs made
324609,turns out solana was a bitcoin killer all along
324610,
324611,big news or just puff
324612,most likely nothing or bad for the industry lol
324613,no law yet
324614,countries change their stance daily they are tard larps ignore all these
324617,also dont think it will change anything
324618,in a month they change from baning crypto mining activities to recognize bitcoin as currencies 2 more weeks and we will buy russia bound with dogecoin
324619,not sure if off topic but my team did a list of current defiish projects in centraleastern europe with links to soc media accounts career pages etc must have missed lots and would love feedback a fuller discussion about the web3 cee context here
324620,well that could be in line with dedollarization policy
324621,gold backed stables makes sense russia been hoarding gold for a while decent way for them to get liquidity from their reserves they do like a dollar hedge
324622,good thread it puts some things in perspective i am pretty convinced that those people are the actual hackers and that it was not some highly technical attack most likely they were presented with an opportunity that originated in the social realm and then went with it
324623,noob question isnt there always an upward pressure on peg in lusd and now on vst wasnt that one of the reasoning for maker to add usdc as collateral
324624,hi all did someone by any chance compiled a list of good security audit reports of different smart contracts
324625,i enjoy reading ozs reports if its any help
324626,this thread is also great
324627,hey all does anyone have a contact at coingecko so we can get assangedaos token listed there just launched
324628,they are really just pumping gno okay the tokenomics for safe in that sheet are total garbage though but thats natural to expect since its weird for a public good saas to have a token as part of the safe token distribution 20 of the total supply will go to the benefit of gno holders thx remi1337 stealing ur alpha
324629,pls check dm
324630,thats what the citadel is for
324631,i mean could be worse theres no airdrop directly to gno holders only to the treasury which will be used to incentivise usage on gnosis chain
324632,gnosisdao should not have 7 of the circulating supplyif the liquid ownership stake of gnosisdao surpasses 7 it must further distribute it by selling issuing to gno holders or other meansgood reason to sell
324633,lmao fantastic gymnastics haha
324634,i mean they are great product builders and amazing ethos all in all so cant really say anything bad even if they print a token for each of their product koeppelmann can just say they prefer multi token future and it would be met positively everyone wins right
324635,not if you are a clown sitting in stables
324636,dont read too much into any news coming from russia
324637,or from anywhere for that matter
324645,imo basic distribution scheme and ofc partially benefiting current holders i dont see anything really off not a quick cash grab per se do also not see a need to make the safe token an integral utility parti like the gnosis spinoffs as that should lead to better positioning for each of the products as well as fulltime teamscommunities focused on specific areas for example the safe dao gov infrastructure integrations bd and value capturesplits for the safe stakeholders
324646,i dont see why not in this particular case
324647,the title is misleading the actual news russian people will have to declare big btc transactions or go to jail just like with foreign currencies
324648,this is correct though they do want to give crypto formal currency designation
324649,because that would open a whole can of worms from a national security standpoint but the designation is a step in the right direction imo
324650,well central bank did want to ban crypto to not lose control over money printer
324651,but then the rest of govt stepped in said they wanted to get taxes out of this instead and got putin on board
324652,also the fact that his friends are secret police spookocracy and those own like a half of all shady crypto exchanges
324653,and by big they mean 02 btc
324654,fsb
324655,i wouldnt give much credence to such news either in my memory this kind of talk has been going on since 2017 in russia with no results i also assume that not all kremlin towers will love this initiative agee with vorot93 herethere is very little accurate information so far and the information that passes looks like an attempt to gauge the society reaction imo thus suggest waiting for actions and precedents first
324656,just talked to my lawyers re that as im still paying my taxes on crypto sales to russia there is no decision yet there is a law re regulation of digital assets which includes cryptocurrencies its drafted but details are not yet done and its not yet operational central bank tries to push it toward complete ban ministry of finance tries to regulate it and take control over crypto without banning it neither side won yet
324657,would be pretty hard for putin to go back on this without losing his face
324658,there are no tokenomics defined at this point the main reason for the token is to establish gnosis safe as a fully communityowned infrastructure if token holders decide that pure governance eg over onchain assets of the project should be the only utility of the token so be it but im sure there will be also discussion around where token mechanisms can foster the ecosystem growth for example the safedao could decide that it makes sense to establish a new l1 where gnosis safe is a firstclass account and have the safe token be the staking token for this network dont think this would make sense but just to illustrate the idea
324659,since he chimed in on ministry of finances side
324660,yeah supposedly the ministry should win but who knows its russia
324661,also if there is someone who wants to go legal and pay taxes on their crypto converted to fiat in russia lmk i have the legal team who managed to make it happen for several people including myself its a bit more complicated and dangerous to do by yourself than it might look
324662,house of cards in russia is the same as house of cards in any other country of the world peculiar elite configuration aside so i dont think its russia saying holds tbh
324663,yes
324664,could you elaborate on the risk i did it in the past and simply declared it as income from crypto operations with screenshots attached the declaration passed the check
324665,well legally you cant just sell crypto to random people without reason or documents provided tax authority can easily send you a request requiring proof of the transactions made sales agreements with counter parties and so on there are many other problems with just declaring but im not sure this is the right place for that sort of conversation
324666,got it i hope the one for 2021 passes as well thank you for the insight
324667,nan
324668,my main contribution to the lobsterdao today is this gif
324669,yeah many guns on the wall in russia dont actually shoot most of the country is not very diligent at correctly declaring their income and paying their taxes but the more money you have and the more you try to use it in the rest of the world the more effort it takes to do everything legallygood luck with 2021
324670,damn that bite
324671,ivan ending the convo
324672,lets discuss lobster nft in a special place love your gif btw
324673,btw we have an erigon office in moscow could talk over the lunch if anyones interested
324676,liquidity all day get liquidity and volume will inevitably comehaving volume wont attract any bigger sized traders if slippage is an issue dont think many would care about volume on a dex compared to how deep the books are i know i wouldnt
324681,does anyone know of a dune analytics platform that surfaces data from more smart contract platforms
324682,lusd has hard peg between 1 and 11 direct arb opportunities and soft peg mechanisms that move price closer to 1 from above such as flexible redeemborrow fees
324683,imo liquity has decent tech and economic design
324684,wow this is wild why would you put taht in public you cant possibly think its good unless its performance art or sth
324685,this explains why
324686,hi guys im a bit confused about the safe transfer rule of erc1155 in case user a sends an nft to a wrong address of user b will the transfer call revert because in the docs it mentioned that the transfer call must revert if any other error occurs so should this case be considered as an other error that was not mentioned about
324687,ah ok so it is performance art that makes more sense
324688,i think no its the users fault not the systems fault
324689,then what are the scenarios included in the other error
324690,thank you this looks exactly like what i am looking for im not familiar with compiling code but do i need to just run createdistsh to do that
324691,whats the best client also open for api if i just want to stream all nft mint tx like this tracker from etherscan
324692,sending to an eoa is fine if the recipient is a contract they need to implement onerc1155received
324693,what if the recipient is a contract that has selfdestructed
324695,it just used the oz iscontract
324696,which returns if the accounts codesize is 0 or not
324697,hi does anyone know how to see the signatures we made with a wallet
324698,those are not stored anywhere unless they sign a tx and emit it to the chain or you have a wallet which stores them i do not know of any
324699,where to stake bal on matic pls
324700,aave
324707,hi guys i got this article when searching about chainlink chainlink on the other hand does not separate the role of price submitter and oracle updater is it true
324708,
324709,is mike demarais in this chat this blocking orgy by the community manager of one of the most popular crypto wallets is getting out of hand
324710,at least get a 2nd community manager whos more inclusive or do they want everyone whos said the slightest critical thing about jackson dame instant block to feel like secondary citizens in the rainbow world
324711,its quite possible mike has not noticed due to also being blocked the blocking by association and likes scripts can well overdo it
324712,i think this solves the problem entirely if no one can see the cancellations because they are blocked did the cancellation really happen
324715,the ram has touched the wall my friend
324716,there is no going back
324717,to counter that narrative just google makerdao scuttlebut oracle
324718,thanks
324719,
324720,
324721,
324722,he is in here
324724,nan
324725,yeah here
324726,why you retire mr duck
324727,anyone is farming on fantombank the apy for stable pool is insane
324728,recently the tvl went from 40m to 200m so im a little bit concerned
324729,bro this shits 247 stress
324730,
324731,and thats without doing mev
324732,better take break on your own terms than to be forced by burnout etc
324733,why do i feel as if im being attacked
324734,anyone into arweave usage i understand the value of permanent censorship resistant data storage but is there any thing beyond thatthe way i look at it it requires miners to actually store the blocks to ensure your data storage is permanent via incentivizing with endowments paid via ar tokens but this doesnt seem like its permanentam trying to think beyond storage uses if it focus on data retrieval services wouldnt 5000 tps be pretty low just comparing to youtube data usage 1b hours per day 200m gb data usage per day and for arweave it didnt even come close to 1tb per day but thats mostly all data storage purposes
324739,all storage chains are generally unsustainable long term
324740,all these farming projects on ftm does it make any sense
324741,ribbon is going to implement vetokenomics
324742,unsustainable in which aspect not enough rewards for miners to continue or adoption rate for permanent isnt needed
324743,oh well i guess convex will be getting even more share in things now
324744,and yearn too if they can
324745,arweaves succinct proofs of random access spora consensus mechanism incentivises miners to prove they have random access to data as a miner its competitive to store more data and less replicated parts of the weave one use case besides nfts and smartcontract frontends over 10 blockchains have partnered with kyve to archive transactionhistory on arweaveclientside smartcontracts are possible on arweave redstone provides the most commonly adopted standard sdk theres an explorer to read the contracts and see interactions70 of data stored is bundled using bundlr where users can pay using eth sol matic etc and get near instant data accessim not sure where the 5000 tps readfigure comes from but if you need to faster reads id imagine youd want a cdn edge compute i dont think comparison with youtube is relevant youtube isnt trying to permanently store data better to measure growth limits and see whether appropriate for the application you have in mind
324746,banteg considering the 1week enterexit periods in ribbon as well as not being able to exit at any time how can it be still possible to integrate ribbon juliankoh asking from the integration perspective re also dm
324747,yeah enterexit delays make it much harder to build farming strategies on top of ribbon
324748,btw is anyone from convex here
324749,btw neuron will launch with venomics revenue sharing votes for rewarding streams weights
324750,for the 5000 tps read it on lightpaper under 44 data storage is only as useful as data retrieval and data retrieval would also incur txn cost right the idea is for wider adoption and if its unable to scale at large for applicational use youtube or any kind of social media itll just be miners mining for rewards chains storing small amount of data relative to global scale
324751,c2tp_eth
324752,
324753,people would just stick to cheaper or even free alternatives like ipfs why pay for 20x data storage even if its permanent average joe wouldnt care less about permanent or not unless they do not wish for their content to be controlled or taken down by 3rd parties with oppressive or censorship agenda
324754,
324755,interesting
324756,yes
324758,not enough space collectively to grow into infinity at this cost the math doesnt check out also as soon as another solution appears a storage chain is basically entering a spiral of death kind of like malls opening next to another mall and offering free rent to tenants that move over so the old mall dies of lack of use until the same thing happens to the new one and the one after etc
324759,arweaves lightpaper from 2018 has not been maintained with regards to not being youtube scale web3 priorities are different to their web2 counterparts this applies to web3 as a whole ser lack of education wrt nft media assets being reliant on a 3rd party to pay for storage is unfortunately a problem there have been protocol hacks caused by frontends being compromised tooipfs speciality is in matching a filehash to content they are different but mutuallycompatible technologiesit costs a few cents to store 10mb permanently btw
324761,anything can be done now
324762,interesting analogy but wouldnt this apply to most protocols either since its all about incentives
324763,but it pays out in proto
324764,metaplex uses arweave for storage services nft is the hot thing right now which is why there might be a correlation for its services rightso taking nft away arweave thats crypto specific would just lose even more uses since ipfs can literally be use for other non crypto purposes low cost easy to use compared to arweave
324765,trying to rise beyond noob understanding here appreciate the patience in discussing
324766,youre comparing impermanent to permanent storage yes clear correlation between nft launches on metaplex and arweave usage
324767,max are u the founder
324768,yep
324769,yup i am which begs the question would average joe really be concern for permanent storage that heshe would pay 20x the price
324770,nice when u are going lo launch the project
324771,need more alpha
324772,we ll launch option pools and token in 2022 q2
324773,nft storage average joe pays zero for that the person launching the nft does generally they just want your money i wager that majority of project parties will be gone and not paying for storage in 10 years this is more of an education problem imonot sure how you are comparing ease of use arweave as a storage option is built into metaplex there are websites that let you drag and drop files and free ar faucets its simple but as with most crypto products still requires a browserextension to be downloaded
324774,not necessarily at least not completely imo if the protocol is versatile enough it has other uses and can pivot specialize depends on community with storage chains they have this one usp hurr durr cheap storage forever which is a lie not unlike free transactions forever see aurora clowns
324775,aurora never claimed to be free forever subsidizing gas costs was always a temporary mechanism to attract usersarweave doesnt claim to be cheap but comparitively when you are looking to store data for 5 years its competitive check the fee calculator to see whether its useful to you rather than these armchair musingsi enjoy buddhist philosophy the day we are born we are old enough to die nothing is guaranteed permanent an asteroid will crash into earth at some point but using cryptoeconomic incentives it aims to sustain the network in the same way users most invested in crypto exchanges obv are incentivised to operate full archival nodes or personally archive their most prized nfts
324776,i dunno none of these things make long term sense to me so i default to ipfs a protocol cant die as easily as a storage chain can and i would rather have my bayc or whatever in my own hands stored in a decentralized way than hope arweave does not go down in more advanced prtocols like rmrk we use multiresources to have several fallbacks for a single nfts media file so you can have your cake and eat it too but relying on one thing with very temporary mathenomics to be around for a long time kinda crazy imo
324777,the protocol is the storage weave anyone can run a node it is decentralised and can easily be one of many sources as you suggest anyway convo goes in circles so i am done
324778,live
324779,no liquidity
324780,admins been very quiet in radial discordsomething cooking
324781,
324782,anyone knows if theres a way to send arbitrum transactions directly to a contract ie similar to etherscans contract functionality arbiscan doesnt support it yet apparently
324783,i am sorry to ask something that was answered 100 times but its almost impossible to ctrlf itare there channels in tgtwitterdiscord that post about fundraises i know only this one
324784,
324785,
324786,arweave is totally sustainable
324787,its optimised for vast quantities of data in fact the block limit for data is more than all data stored ever
324788,hi mates we are hosting a dev event during ethdenver the devcon golden ticket hackathon on monday the 14th the top 3 buidlers are coming with us to colombia to attend devcon 6 welcome everyone smarttokenlabscomethdenver
324789,isnt the model based on inflation rewards do you think that can work long term
324790,in terms of improving writing to arweave im founder of bundlr which is a network working to improve arweaves write and read speed so you can quite easily optimise this for real time applications we already do this
324791,as in inflationary storage costs
324792,if i remember correctly the economic model is that users pay once and then the system gives inflation rewards to miners is that correct
324793,does anyone here know how to bypass the price impact too high block on dexs
324794,well its a mixture of rewards are given out for winning a block which are relative to network difficulty and youre strongly incentivised to store the entire weave all the data
324795,right which means in a sense users are paying once for a resource theyll consume forever correct while i understand theres a strong assumption that storage will become cheaper over time but this still sounds economically unsustainableincome is one off and costs are recurring in perpetuity
324796,i dont remember the exact figures but the real storage deflation cost is 2030 per year arweave assumes 13 maybe less i can verify this
324797,and then you can build very very strong incentives to hold rare data
324798,the more data and more rare data you hold the more you make
324799,when you refer to users i think the user base is rather limited since many people would t be willing to pay such high price for permanent storage their idea of permanent storage dont go beyond their lifespan
324800,which is the fundamental structure for all crypto networks in fact id argue this is stronger than most networks
324801,i appreciate your kind words and it has been a pleasure doing battle with you however it is still far too early for you to quit i glanced over your github and eoa you have a nice bot but no matter how much you cut down your latency you wont be able to beat those who are better capitalized trade larger sizes and thus can afford to pay higher gas prices so learn make more money become faster no matter how long it takes i will wait for you in my strongest form until that day you must hone your abilities then seek me out and surpass me
324802,this man is legend for reply the author of
324803,oh cool me big depositor ser anyway building an integration into convex now and ofc since it does not gib lp tokens back like yearn it would require us gearbox to build some intermediary contract inbetween to give those said lp tokens for example cause like imagine you got liquidated but you did not claim rewards for 1 month ok then it should be accounted for during liquidations cause you cant be just taken apart from it those are your rewards ok then more oracles in place are needed for all the different coins cvxcrvstkaavesnxwhatever and then you have to account for claim gas costs basically its not as trivial could we ask some dev questions in a chat maybe
324804,absolutely glad to see dev questions and discussions in this chat
324805,why the spam yes there is no activity but there is no launch yet either no rug rn whats the issue dont tag andre for small bullshit things just got dmed this link reply is there
324806,does anyone know where i can find an uptodate accurate list of nakamoto coefficients this link is all i can find but it has no dates
324807,now the guy he talks to has x3 more competitors than before
324808,so feeding abracadabra cauldron through selling 9m luna nice movement do kwon
324809,they will not be selling just minting right
324810,
324811,dunno wtf this is but drama
324812,withdraw 95m luna on feb 11th 12pm sgt swap 95m luna to ust over the course of 510 days which should result in 450m ust being mintedso swapping not overcollaterizing and borrow ustit is what it is swap selling to open market
324813,maybe he misspoke non native why would you dump if u could mint
324814,they market selling 95m luna
324815,swap over 510 days 450m 95m luna 4736 per luna i dont know lets see how they will do it
324816,do is a crafty little bugger
324817,as far as i can see premia has the only options vaults that you can enterexit any timealso relevant for gearbox i suppose
324818,in the terra station app by default you can choose whether you burn via the native ust luna mechanism or swap when they burned all the extra 4b worth of luna after the col5 upgrade there was no impact to peg price and yeah 4550m worth of luna being exchanged burned swapped for ust a day is nothing given last 24h volume is 12b usd worth
324820,dopex atlantics soon
324821,hi frens icymi i forked lobsterdao hr and made tmedailyapehr so feel free to pm me if you want to hirebe hired
324822,you conveniently forgot to mention the deposit fee i suppose
324823,it flies until it stops nothing new here
324824,but their assets will be locked if its used to underwrite some options right
324825,rightbut with instant withdraw one will face exposure to the bidaskk spread that is currently huge in defi for options since the market is in its infancy
324826,because all active optoon positions will be sold to other pool participants also liquidity pool is not dov to be precise in vanilla dov all funds are used for option writing in liquidity pools amount of options written is determined by user demands
324827,no you can withdraw by paying the current premium essentially buying the option out this way the option seller has effectively changed from yourself to the person you pay the premium to only possible it there is enough free liquidity in the pool
324828,in premia lp your funds can be used to write options with unpredictable strikes in dovs funds will be used to write options with riskdetermined strike
324829,yes sir its all different compromises in a large design space as were used to in defi
324830,its the most composable options lego thats live today
324831,thats why i mentioned it when yearnoptions were discussed
324834,its not same fusd as on fantom chain
324836,what is weird is that its a 15 person account with no following while you immediatepy share it nneverlander seemed suspicious i have a bag is locked val was 180m idk whats wrong not shilling anything
324837,nothing wrong with withdrawing weth and liquidity pool will go down if everyone decides to exit thats no different here there are other markets than uniswap too
324838,whats suspicious
324839,someone sent it to me as they thought it was relevant to us so shared it here to see what ppl thought why does it matter if they have 15 followers data is accurate
324840,ah looksrare isnt it public info by now that it was a massive influencer driven cash grab
324841,why is that a cash grab
324843,its a fantastic platform just overvalued for now
324844,as an nft buyer on opensea i pretty much earned my looks airdrop back in weth by staking free monies i dont care the platform is pretty cool though i like it
324845,imagine team and investors cashing out 60m usd one month after a project launch
324846,youre complaining about the revenue share which is a percentage of fees generated in eth
324847,idc tbh but web3 folks scoff at teams raising vc funds but are ok with fair launches like this
324848,yeah its the same as theopendao thing with more maintream twitter influencers the borolman tweet thread you guys are referring to was accurate factually speaking without subjective opinions
324849,you are not saying anything
324850,whats the argument here
324851,the argument is essentially that early seed investors earned a shitton of eth on their vested tokens due to washtrading and that they can eventually unload their bags as well the social momentum of looksrare was obviously also driven by those seed investors many of which were big ct influencers nothing too special about it its just how those things gowhether looksrare actually proves itself to be a viable product can first be determined after the seed investors exited and the ponzinomics cooled down no reason to hate on it calling it a money grab just yet
324852,not really complaining just wanted to see what ppl thought of this i made a decent chunk of money by trading looks
324853,ye its a fair play nobody dumped tokens people wash trade which is a strategy to get rewards too nobody said is a fair launch either ita not really a sensible argument to shit on an aggressive but working strategy
324854,i staked since day 1 and made half of my initial back essentially cashed out a profit and letting the rest ride sohnds like people are just salty they got in late
324855,yes it might be overvalued right now but if it goes any lower then buying is a nobrainer
324857,just adjust your timeframes to 6 or 12 months not weeks
324858,sorry i just assumed everyone was reading the tweet threas just as me the argument is that the following 2 strategies are the samestrategy 1 launch shitcoin for a fork market it heavily through influencers dump on pool2 using unlocked tokensstrategy 2 launch shitcoin for a fork claim teaminvestor tokens are locked use influencers to promote wash trading to farm tokens and let teaminvestors take a cut of feesif strat 1 is abhorrent so is strat 2 if not then not the commentors above are just establishing equivalence
324859,so far looksrare has attracted a lot of business from opensea and put pressure on opensea to improve win win imo in the realworld its quite common for large companies to use predatory tactics to steal business from other shops eg a lossmaking coffee shop supermaket with the aim of putting the competitors out of businessin this case it looks like the team and investors have likely earned their monies back far better than the strategy i mention it would be cause for concern if the team had no intention to continue the project
324860,people should be pissed off at opensea they stole all your money
324861,with the halvening could see the typical vicious cycle where now since theres only half the rewards and looks price has been tanking wash trading volume dries up by more than half raw eth apr earned by stakers drops by more than half makes it less attractive to hold stake which leads to more selling and the lower the price goes the less wash trading will be done to earn looks
324862,sell and buy the dip i really dont see an issue
324863,people get so obsessed with moralising and ideological issues they forget to make money
324864,yup its a good project if the nft youre buying is the same price on both its a no brainer to buy from there and actually get something for it vs not getting anything paying more platform fees on opensea
324865,yea this looks like they tried hard to hide the fees the teaminvestors are making like the guy in that thread said its totally cool for a project to have revenue but instead of a simpler way of doing this they devised this roundabout way which is sketchy
324866,its not sketchy ffs its a revenue share system with the revenue being a totally different currency no one is hiding anything
324867,ok
324868,its less sketchy than straight up hardcoding a rev stream to a whitelisted address like other projects do it
324869,passive staking for weth for seedlocked tokens was known in advance as far as i know
324870,10x on eth by seed investors in a month well played thanks for airdrop to looks team anywaythe question is that i heard that team was fired by cz exbunny core devs making hostages from seed investors and threatens to take away allocation if something bad would be spoken in public field about looksrare
324871,source that is definitely malicious
324872,def heard they were exbinance not sure about threats
324873,this you cant fork a ui either
324874,so its not a fork since os is closed source suited reptile organization
324875,its equivalent to a shop that exchanges foreign currency and pays the staff and shareholders in dollars i dont see problem in that
324876,frankly the looks team has not hidden that the seed stakers get tokens
324877,so as such cant call it a bad hustle
324878,but it is what it is market participants should do their dd
324879,i can attest i have done absolutely 0 i am the most useless investor and they never asked me for anything any support i showed is personal bias i tested the platform we put lobbies there set up royalties tried the floor bid option all worked very well for me
324880,rofl
324881,never heard of that whats your source
324882,its about what you do when you dont get the saft
324883,exactly you learned it the smart way
324884,i think its not the fact that its a revenuesharing marketplace thats questionable rather whats being sold to retail the ultimate buyers of looks who are providing exit liquidity to the wash traders to keep the system alive does the product make any sense opensea doesnt have a token because revenue sharing would make it an obvious security
324886,lmao
324887,yeah i just assumed early investors and team had their tokens staked and are getting their share of the eth secondaries the same way everybody else is as they need money to growbuild etc it actually makes sense and is more sustainable imo as theyre incentivized to hold their tokens and drivesustain trading volume on the platform rather than dump their tokens on retail at some future price pumpunlock
324888,its all public info lol
324889,but being marketed differently
324890,normies would buy a picture of a dog with no usecase
324891,no they have an additional treasury of 30m the team already cashed out to individual wallets totaling 30m
324892,most pool2s that are hated also have all info in public doesnt stop us from criticizing them as cash grabs here when we know there are fundamental flaws in whats being marketed
324893,fair
324894,so did many investors see the withdrawals on ethersscan
324895,hard to see long term prospects when team makes so much money so early
324896,team was giga rich before the start its peanuts for them
324897,so these accusations seem a but out of place idk
324898,good for them
324899,yeah thats a subjective argument many rich teams continue to work hard
324900,theres actually a convex deposit token you get back but its not interest bearing and thus have to stake it to start getting the rewardsthe staking part can be wrapped up to fit how you want to integrate on your side and we have examples on how to do this in fact abracadabra uses our wrappers to create an erc20 position that directs rewards directly to the usersfeel free to get in touch to go deeper as i may miss things in this chat
324901,yes cvx3crv on abra wonder how easy it is to liquidate
324902,this is awesome thank you dmed
324903,as far as os killers go gem has a good chance imo
324904,all token purchases are exit liquidity if the token purchases doesnt accruesustain value yes looks seems like an obvious security to me but thats a medium to long term risk to the platform creators not short term risk to buyers i mean thats a whole lotta contracts and ui to build docs to write etc just for an exit scam of something thats actually a viable competitor product
324905,arguably dydx incentivised washtrading after launching their token too
324906,where only team profited actually
324907,where in looks it was stakers who also happened to be backers
324908,the market makers i think
324909,anyone is free to be a market maker heck i was washtrading it myself manually lol
324910,yeah i just said it wasnt only team
324912,marketmakers got valueless dydx tokens but later this year they will remove the ability for the company to profit from the protocol
324913,if dydx can actually decentralize its trading engines then sure otherwise dydx token is as useless and as much an exit liquidity for vcs as is a decentralized opensea right now
324914,nan
324915,and i think uniswapdydx tokens have taken a fair share of criticisms atleast its clear that uniswap can be run in decentralized way a decentralized opensea or uber isnt so obvious
324916,dont think a completely decentralized os is possible with the current crypto infra
324917,yeah its definitely not an exit scam by any means team had a demo even before they starting raising and was asking for feedbackbeta testing duringthe exchange is not perfect yet ofc but neither is opensea and theyve been quick to ship even pushing opensea to be more aggro tooye tokenomics is aggro but they have to get marketshare imo
324918,thank you jason
324919,yeah despite wash trading being illegal afaik the real problem with it is when its used to fake volume and value of the underlying asset looks using it as a customer acquisition strategy doesnt do that its not the same nefarious activity as somebody wash trading nft art so they can offload a valueless piece to some unsuspecting collector who sees good price history
324920,most projects have witnessed some amount of washtradingmercenary farming no ones against it the hate against it is similar to the hate i would get if i launched a decentralized uberairbnb here today and say that hey i launched a token to be the first mover be aggressive and gain all market share in darrens line of reasoning
324921,yeah in looks case wash trading is really just people buying and selling to themselves so nothing nefarious about that imoi assume people will also check other exchanges to see the true floor price of assets esp since the discrepancies are huge lot of data analytics platforms that show it too guts has also been super responsive whenever i spam him w opensealooks complaints which is like daily lmfao
324922,yeah its not wash trading in my book its farming wash trading is an intentional deception tactic to fluff market volume looks rare is just transmining incentives leading to farming different thing imo
324923,what data analytics platforms do you recommend for seeing this
324924,liquidity mining farming
324925,
324926,i think the difference is looks actually launched with a product that works and has unique features comparing it to some pitch deck with no actual product isnt very accurate
324927,exactly phrasing it as farming actually makes the distinction clear well put
324928,the 2017 decentralized airbnb project did have a fully functional website you could list houses and stuff
324929,if it was so easy to fork opensea as you termed it why is looks the only one that has actually launched something like this despite the nft tear in 2021
324930,you are putting words in my mouth i didnt say its easy to build opensea
324931,i said if we regularly ridicule projects which launch tokens for products which dont need a token looks is worthy of ridicule too for eg
324932,binance led by the worlds richest crypto billionaire is taking a 200 million stake in forbes cnbc
324933,i was assuming you were talking about looks
324934,farming to me is a generalised term for playing a value extraction game on a protocol farming tokens in a liquidity mining game farming tokens by trading farming a play to earn game all similar
324935,the crux of the argument was the absurdity of the product being marketed and not that its easy to fork
324936,lol ccr 2019 is back what is a product that doesnt need a token
324937,i can see the argument where everything in the future is tokenized comes from just that some will be securities some will be utility tokens as we understand them today purely decentralized i can see a decentralized opensea built with a totally different ground up architecture
324938,i think the take away is if you are an investor in looks dont virtue signal about vcs being bad lol if the incentives align most humans behave the same
324939,whats the connection
324940,ye idk whats this false narrative it was never spread
324941,ok lets end it weird yet again bashing from anon accs done
324942,
324943,yessir
324944,i think you both as looks investors very conveniently glossed over the meaningful arguments but fair its a boring discussion and repetitive now
324945,thanks for sharing all your thoughts gathered some useful perspectives
324949,guys whats the viable alternative for gnosissafe for multisig with gui that works on eth and sidechains
324951,hey folks does anyone know of any good resources on uiux applied to web3 specifically to train people that are already experienced designers but struggling to make the shift from traditional website design
324952,can connect you with a great web3native uxui studio
324953,dm
324954,i dont think there is specific uxui knowledge in web3 just analyze main dapps like uniswap aave ribbon ohm

324960,yo fellow lobstersi have a questiondoes anyone know of an easy way to do a uniswappancakespirit swap like the following1buy token x from its v2 pool2 add send to another address3 include a message as utf8 in the input dataand do this all in one txis there a simple ui that allows this all or do i need to to a manual contract call and what would be the syntaxthanks
324961,our v3 will support that and much more

324964,you mean depositingwithdrawing into pools with timelock mechanics at any time
324965,supporting strategies that lock liquidity
324967,do you have optionbased strats in perspective
324968,
324969,doing gearbox element spaces rn feel free to tune in
324970,this key was created in a secure enclave and nobody had access to itthis is how avalanche bridge is workingbtw interesting tech readthread about different approaches to crosschain bridges and arguments
324971,check replies in there roman agreed w emins reply
324972,yes this is why this whole convo is interestingwith sss u have to trust that special hardware no one has access to generated seed and shared keys and deleted all of it afterbasically itstrust us its not eoa its multisig
324974,anyone here read andres solidly code i cant wrap my head around the calculate_emission function in basev1mintersol
324975,how come weekly variable is set to 20m
324976,isnt it meant to be 2m
324977,20m weekly constant 98 emission constant circ supply 100 target_base constant total supplywas supposed to target 2 emissions adjusted according to comments in code so does feel like something is maybe off here i would have thought 20m emissiontarget_base circtotal would have made more sensethis is in for anyone elsemaybe andrecronje can chip in and embarrass my smoothbrain
324978,
324979,now it is 20m09808 if 80 is circulating looks ok for me only circulating part is dilluted vested is fixed
324980,should it not be a base rate of 2m that gets adjusted by circulating not 20m
324981,for me it looks like emission should be 2 weekly constant is how much to distribute in total it depends on token total supply
324982,2 of desired weekly or 02 of total circulating kind of logic
324983,any good book on algorithms and data structures for dummies pls
324984,does anyone know of public datasets apis that map optimism and arbitrum and other blocks to their timestamps
324985,this is for finding a block by timestamp
324986,classic book for that topic
324987,
324988,this website is a pretty good resource as well
324989,thanks
324990,gm lobs tried to collect all possible web3 security tools in one place based on academia researches please suggest if any tool you know is missing here i ll get in touch with authors and provide feedback for the next redaction of study twittercomofficer_ciastatus1491830302922133505

325003,any recommendations for the best notification service to not get rekt by liquidations
325004,great product
325005,anyone noticed etherscan added chat icon near address
325006,nan
325007,yes its blockscan chat could change a lot of things
325008,yeah look forward to attracting more general users who dont understandcare transaction details but social network
325009,
325010,any ftm peeps here does ftm have any intention to change out using mongodb
325011,is there a way to do private chat though like for only the wallet owner to be able to read the message
325012,right now its more like bulletin board
325014,im a founder and we are planning to launch a move2earn game where people earn nfts as rewards for exercising wanted to know your views on whether personalised nfts ie something which is very unique to the user work ex if i reward a user an nft for number of steps heshe has walked in a month
325015,my major worry is that while it is great for bragging nobody would want to buy this people wont see them as investment opportunities
325016,do you store the steps on chain
325017,hey lobs our testnet is live at on arbitrum testnet just connect your wallet and youre good to go please try it out wed love to hear your feedback over in our tgdiscord or send it below
325018,for context were a decentralized and noncustodial derivatives protocol which facilitates the creation of perpetual swap markets for any token pair and were building on arbitrum
325019,we plan to
325020,which oracle do you use
325021,if you are using uni v3 i doubt they have sufficient liquidity on arb to make it safe to list jsut any token for perp trading
325022,
325023,
325024,why the assembly in this file is split into chunks and is not inside one or two assembly blocks the first 2 and the last 3 chunks could be grouped together no doesnt help with readability much maybe its an optimization
325025,lets continue this in nft_avenue please forward the message there but i agree it would be too much like an honorary nft as such not relatable to anyone but that person

325030,brief filed by govt regarding detention of finex launderers
325031,this seems like a pinnacle
325032,so it was solidly encrypted yet they decrypted in less than a year
325033,or maybe even less they mention 2021 as the year of access to cloud storage without specifying the date
325034,thanks ivangbi i have posted the question to nft_avenue
325035,me too please
325036,
325037,sure dm me pls
325038,please
325039,doesnt mean they actually broke the encryption they could have gotten their hands on the key or parts of it through surveillance or other evidence
325040,heya allsaw a topic that uploading a white list of lets say 4k entries will cost few ethwhat about using a lagrange multiplier in order to create a polynom and then you just need to see if the address is a solution to that polynom
325041,i think usually people do it via merkletree these days
325042,i guess you right
325043,your idea sounds interesting does it work on paper
325044,wouldnt you have to create a unique polynomial per address
325045,you dontthe addresses are the points thatare the solution of the polynomlets simplify itxx0xx1so gives you x2 poly where x0 and x1 are the solutionbut i dont know if its any better of merkle
325046,yep its pure math you just create a function that goes through all the solutions each address is a solution and only them
325047,i am not sure i used the right term but there is one if needed will search later
325048,btw the function might be heavy as wellso it doesnt save unless it is in some other g field maybe i am not a mathematician
325049,how intensive would it be to find a solution that takes in a few k adresses seems intensive
325050,it would only be practically interesting if it takes less gas to calculate whether an address is valid than the merkel approach collisions could be a concern as well
325051,ye you right bothneed benchmarks of the validation the creation is one time off chain of coursei believe that it was tested as well before
325052,cant get the point of uploading n coefficients for the polynom instead of n solutions
325053,yep also thought about it just later
325058,
325059,
325060,and what is being hacked lol
325061,no clue nobody seems to have any idea i can never figure solscan stuff out
325062,maybe its that solcasino crap
325063,airdropped 100 worth to thousands of addys
325064,to claim you have to login to their site and sign a message
325066,bro where are these rumors coming from lol
325067,weth withdrawal statement from that tweetstorm yesterday
325068,salty salty looks fudders started to pop up as soon as looks staking rewards halved
325069,i mean whats wrong if they are withdrawing 10billimonth
325070,freemarkets be free markets if its not burning third party money
325071,what is wrong with people using their fees rewards for whatever they want
325072,
325073,theres still a vesting period right
325074,yes over a year if i remember correctly
325076,please that in lobsterdao
325077,well see i guess how much bribes solidly will attract as a protocol that can be good earning for 0xdao especially i guess solidex got a lot of good partners radial seems to be behind the race eh reptiles just gonna watch
325078,looks like its already tradingquite expensive atm if you wanna load up for lping though
325079,anything above 0 is fine as long as no rug any effort is fine i guess
325080,true but if circ supply is probably less then 1 atm buying for lps make it a super high risk of getting rekt
325081,solana is turning into the cream of blockchains
325082,are we sure this is a hack
325083,anybody know more
325084,they can finally do an attestation at random intervals as opposed to at predetermined times with approved 3rd parties
325090,some weird nosource info redacted weird shit back it up with something
325092,eth merge community call happening right now if youre bored
325096,you in seed round or something
325097,
325099,fozzysbo scroll up for a convo there is nothing hidden what annoyed me is the hey guys their is rumour tdevs get paid 100k a month but i cannot confirm it which would be deleted regardless of which project you address that to no source just spam so put your muh conspiracy back where it came from kind ser
325100,what conspiracy lol just stating they set it up so all locked tokens could receive eth trading rewards which they are cashing out
325101,well yes thats clear af but that was discussed above and that convo is above
325102,i deleted the msgs with regard to some weird nosourced bs rumour
325103,
325104,
325110,absolutely bonkers imagine waking up one morning scanning through a github repo finding some critical and likely bug reporting it then retiring immunefis bounty board has essentially become an advertising leaderboard at this point for dick swinging in protocol security
325112,well for a bug like that on an established protocol its likely weeksmonths of pentesting then if you find something promising its quite a few days to make up the the proof of concept ensure it works and then write it all up and in all this you need to be an absolute fucking expert on solidity the type of person whod land 400k jobs easily
325113,i joined the vulnerability rewards program on google back in the day made less than minimum wage i was just a teen with little experience but its def not easy and thats by simply testing on as many fields as you can find in defi you need to actually know how smart contracts work even just to start
325114,otoh you have sup i have an idea
325115,survivorship bias for each one of these theres 1000 that failed applies to almost anything in life tbh
325116,from the other side operating a bug bounty prgram is like standing in front of a sewer pipe on full blast trying to find diamonds its an imperfect system but 10m sure sells a dream that motivates
325117,weve come so far
325118,do you know the reason its called a bug is because actual bugs used to come sit in the sheets used to imprint code so the person running a compiler an actually huge physical machine had to go clear up the sheets of physical bugs
325119,is that an official lobster dao collaboration with incentives for testing such as gear
325120,we post our official collabs on twitter sir twittercom10b57e6da0 and there are no posts about this exchange no offence just clarifying situation this is definitely not a official collaborationcurrently we have collaboratedcollaborating with ambire wallet gearbox coinlist nansen defiant mean finance icy tools atlantis world dfx and negotiated with tracer arable gro radial and geist and several projects on pause
325121,this main chat is not the right place to discuss dao collaborations and our lobster nft collection so lets move our convo here lobsterdao
325122,
325123,what could this possibly be
325124,just curious why u want to get into data structures and algo now
325125,
325126,yes same question
325127,wdym because its the topic im not good at and what ive read on it was academic beyond my understanding
325128,nice quite unusual of people in crypto asking about ds and algo although those are very imp skills in development
325129,i think you can try leet code pick a category for example linked list read a problem what is it about then go back to the book or google about it then try to solve the problem best way to excel it is to have an hand on
325133,i dont think this is a correct take web programs have this problem because there is a massive population of web bug hunters looking to make a quick buckblockchain security is almost strictly high skill so this is less than an issue and we at immunefi provide filtering to further minimize noise to signal but generally signal to noise ratio is a lot higher it is further mitigated by effective program creation which few understand these are just another type of business transaction and when treated that way the dynamic changes a tonne
325134,the parties are already in touch lets see how it plays out
325135,maybe a poor metaphor on my end but you must receive 1000x as many bogus messages compared to the real ones as you say how many of the people browsing immunefi view it as a business transaction id expect there to be a solid core of professionals but they must be severely outnumbered by people just flinging whatever they can find at you to try and get paid do more people take it seriously than dontwait nevermind i didnt understand meaning of noise to signal ignore my smoothbrain
325136,can confirm immunefi triage provides very high signal reports we are happy customers
325137,nan
325138,nan
325139,what about black hats knowing that they have an option before making dumb decisions an option that rivals the bad the bounties work for that too not only for people actively looking for stuff to claim it
325140,
325141,
325142,
325143,blockfi to pay 100 million in fines to sec link
325147,looks like the frax fpi snapshot date is confirmed
325148,can anybody confirm that theblock research service is available for individuals or not
325151,hi some one knows what happened with inj
325152,injective protocol i mean
325153,i think the final unlock happened
325154,fyi cowswap airdrop is claimable now but no rush you got 6 weeks to claim and token is not transferable kinda like gearbox article
325155,i jsut realised the tax benefits of non transferrable tokens
325156,its pretty nifty
325157,url for claim cant find
325158,normal website button on top right corner kinda uniswap style
325160,found it now was from mobile
325161,
325162,most non eth stuff is 0 tvl yet apys are almost same no point going away from eth in this sheet at least
325163,
325164,didnt read yet ofc
325165,protocol changewe begin with the addition of internal bonds these are similar to the external bondswe know today a user trades a quote token with the protocol in return for an amount of ohm inthe future internal bonds differ from external bonds in that the quote token the token given tothe protocol is ohm rather than an external asset ie dai eth etc for each 1 ohmdeposited the depositor is given a note giving claim to x ohm at y date where x is assumed to be greater than 1as far as i understandso basically they are introducing bonds which are extracting ohm from the market to give u more ohm later with interestits an alternative to the insane apy which will be reduced to switch the focus from apy to bonds sales
325166,a pretty complicated way of implementing staking rewards that depend on the time you lock your tokens
325167,it could potentially be one were thinking of that as an option
325168,bros can anyone enlighten me how bancor can offer such huge base apr for stable coins in addition to their own token rewards with such stats
325169,nan
325170,youre not just depositing usdc youre providing liquidity to the usdcbnt pair
325171,yes i get that but check the stats volume and thus fees are very low
325172,its saturday so i am sharing this
325173,how does impermanent loss works on curve pools with notcorrelated assets like tricrypto and v2 pools
325174,or better how does the v2 curve curve looks like compared to the standard xyk uniswap curve
325175,dear sers could anyone please recomment bridge from any polular evmlike chain to tron usdt turned out there some usecase like get visa to bali where trc20 usdt is the only crypto option but seem like anyswap lifinance and others dont support it something what i got from google search indistinguishable from finsihingscam since i never work with tron ecosystem
325176,indonesia doesnt accept crypto payment for visas
325177,doesnt look like theres a decentralised option they say use poloniex binance
325178,spoiler alert no bridges are decentralized
325179,there is a bridge between tron bttc and also between bttc ethbsc
325180,more seriously this guy is getting scammed because you cant get a visa for bali with crypto
325181,didnt know bali has their own visa i thought bali is just an island in indonesia
325182,its my concern as well being russian citizen its pain in butt to get us visa to visit all these ethdevers etc so the possible solution is to get to indenesia and apply there but to get there i need visa as well so its an agency that claims that do asistance but i havent worked with them before so theres a possibility they are scammers the offer is that they themselves exachange trx20usdt to indonesian rupies to pay legal fees and presumingly thats the only way they can swap it from crypto i assume they dont know other way
325183,so if anyone can recomment any other more trusted agencies to do this visa chores or have resonable thought to belive that aforementioned one is scammers i would greately appreciate as well to justify offtop in lobster this might be usefull for other members to visit all this amazing crypto events and shill 10b57e6da0
325185,perhaps get in touch with nomad capitalist to ask these questions not sure how competitive their services are they have lots of content on youtube
325188,no youre giving single side and you are il covered after 90 days
325189,didnt know that thanks sounds good
325190,the trick is that the gas fee are very high so basically its for whales only
325191,
325192,what do you think about nthe vulnerability
325194,theres not much liquidity in there because there is not enough bnt to provide any more stables singlesided if you try to provide singlesided usdc or dai it will not let you
325195,little liquidity fee revenue per dollar invested into the pool is high
325196,nan
325197,bnt needs to be provided to open up space how does that work
325198,single sided liquidity works by bancor allocating its own bnt to pair with your token
325199,it currently doesnt have enough for this pool
325200,ren is not in tron tho
325201,i also searched that time ago due to usdt trc20 being popular in some crypto atms and ended giving up and using kucoin that at least is kyc free
325202,didnt ren delay their decentralization
325203,happy to hear more about it
325204,maxroszko
325205,i meant it in the darknodestech sense as per dao last time i looked they were voting treasury stuff idk how they stand now tbh but i still consider them the only true decentralized and reliable tech for interchain on already existing chains have you seen what varen did
325206,i think greycore is still in testnet governance stuff is another thing
325207,thanks
325208,sup
325209,long wait time for a call and high retainer prefer michael rosmer offshore citizen can get a call in a few days wealthy expat was decent as well free to chat but he is most familiar with dubai
325210,thats you
325211,yes whats up
325212,best bet for relocation is finding the local expat group on facebookwhatsappetc and asking for a lawyergestor youll usually get recommended the firm that nomad capitalist others will recommend without the hefty commission priced in
325213,damn bruh youre dope and so is the guy youre mentioning
325214,the tech is basically ready its being deployed in a slow pace to give time for a lot of testing bug fixing hardening etc
325217,i use anycashbot centralised custody obv but i know founders and use it for many many years
325221,and this will be muh first decentralized bridge
325222,max and loong not holding any secret keys
325223,anyone
325224,does it uses the same curve as uni v2
325225,no set date but looks like all issues are fixed and we are expecting sometime next week
325227,
325228,for tri pools its more like a 3 asset balancer pool
325229,so its constast invariant like uni thenjust with 3 assets
325230,i thought they used something different
325231,they do you can read their whitepaper for more info iirc its high level spreading liquidity thicker around an internal moving average oracle price
325232,i dont think its the exact same though
325233,does anybody know the organiser one of the sponsors just told me of their appalling behaviour
325234,can you give context was planning on attending
325235,1
325236,so impermanent loss should be a lot greater than balanceruni isnt it
325237,do you know where the oracle is from
325238,yes
325239,nan
325240,i know the organisers for years they are great ppl
325241,all dvpn providers we have looked at orchid sentinel mysterium and deeper default to a onehop connection as of february 2022
325242,not really fees are dynamic there and rebalancing costs are a function of speed of market moves gas prices and pool size
325243,oracle is internal it uses 10 minute ema iirc
325244,make it kind of a lotteryrandom ones so there is a chance you can win rare ones which might have collectibletrading value think pokemon
325245,let me check if they are comfortable sharing but what they showed me was pretty bad
325246,hey there not sure what they told you but they accused me of things ive never said and then got mad when i defended myself
325247,this is not the right place dms ser
325248,will do answered here because you mentioned it here
325249,appreciate it
325250,thevergenetflix orders docuseries on crypto laundering couple
325251,hmm do you know about stepn theres also genopets i do like the idea of incentivising good habits not explored this concept much but i do know that various apps exist in web2 space to encourage exercise habits usually centered around being accountable to a group of others
325253,what messages
325256,not to crypto those false accusation messages were in private
325259,yes that was my reaction heh
325265,it might be more interesting to have exercise generate credits that can then be used to buy and customise a nft eg take a look at how aavegotchi lets you buy all sorts of wearables via the erc998 composable nft spec maybe w limited or timespecific garments for sale
325266,were you denied an esta
325267,i only ask because you mentioned a visa you dont want a visa you want a visa waiver
325268,not for russians
325269,my bad thought that system was universal sorry for misinfo
325271,hey geniuses lets say i want contract1 on chain a to send some tokens to contract2 on chain b but i also want to pass some associated data to contract2 so that it knows what to do with the tokens a and b are both evm chains but not in the same ecosystem so i cant take advantage of any subnetsparachainsibc type magic whats the simplest most standard way to send the data im new to web3 dev so forgive me if theres an obvious approach for this that im not seeing
325274,will be nice to meet lobsters there
325275,afaik no straightforward solution yet but movr was building smth similar
325283,layer zero
325284,gpact can do that too
325285,both are generalized messaging protocols for interchain exchange
325286,here is some docs and code
325287,
325288,
325289,iron bank innit
325290,no andrecronje is not doing ib and hasnt been for a long time dont associate
325291,felt the need to clarify it given their weird creamassociated token moves
325292,weird needed a new team allocation
325293,i would guess fixed forex but who knows multi chain also 2 words lotta possibilities
325294,
325295,wait where did they get so many users
325296,airdrop hunters
325297,you need to use intermessaging system based on some bridge like celer network im or tonbridge
325298,you d give zero collateral loans in a trustless environment only to those you call partner or friend
325299,also would explain the last minute airdrop cancellation by ib team which has yet to be justified cream discord ded twitter ded
325300,quick update context arranged a call between the organisers and sponsors to figure out what seems to be a massive miscomunication both good ppl hope things will get fixed shortly
325303,i have heard about this conference drama from both sides and yeah would very much like to have this resolved greed can really ruin people
325304,they dont have any lobsterdao nft were mad about the floor price of getting one and now they get no discount on the event
325305,top 40 crypto vc investment funds by demonstrated results
325306,theres no way this is accurate lol
325307,alameda at negative yield ok
325308,its measured from july 2020 until dec 2021 i believe
325309,it doesnt factor in secret discounts
325310,secret discounts as seedprivate what does it factor then
325311,price at time of announcement
325312,
325313,this is garbo usually because nobody knows the exits the at which these funds raised follow up rounds etc etc never pay attention to such stats
325314,absolutely right such funds usually exiting via market makers and under strict nda
325315,it could take months for them to exit
325316,it was built as a alpha indicator if a fund announces they are invested in a token is it bullish to buy in after or bearish
325317,it doesnt rate the actual investment result of those guys because yes as you said you dont know their actual entry or actual exit
325318,it doesnt serve as such unless they are a retail or kol type of muh fund focused on dumping early and making money early thats the only thing you can say from that really anything midterm and further it would be not a signal
325319,if you had to list top 40 vcs for the benefit of new projects how would you start
325320,people still share that old vc tier sheet which was a mess
325321,digit dao shilling it on andrecronje s name and doing pd would be better if andre can clarify before people get rekt
325322,i would say projects need to think what they want and why instead of looking for vc lists in this environment at least
325323,literally no clue what youre talking about but also there are 10 projects per week claiming some kind of involvement with me ive learned tweeting about my lack of involvement normally gives them even more publicity so i just say nothing if its not on my medium or twitter im not involved
325325,does someone have any eth on boba network need for comission bridge out i will send u x2 in busd first
325327,hm how is the yield calculated exactly
325328,
325329,pretty interesting wow
325330,btw this is some unknown weird fake dao account probably ignore anyway
325331,the report is so bad they even included projects that dont have tokens yet lol
325332,oh there is a report lol
325333,if excel tables in a substack count as a report then yup haha
325334,reported it thanks
325335,
325336,i did
325337,and allow passing data between chainslz approach appears to be easier for devs but more centralized and the last time i checked they were not on any testnet nomad is just chad tech great team some are in this chat i believe
325338,they are known for either edgy rumours or absolute bs nothing inbetween really wanna have a laugh at the numbers lasseclausen
325339,apparently u r losing money
325340,wu blockchain is never a credible source yellow paper circus sorry i wouldnt be saying that if they didnt try to show bs data as research
325341,wow what a read o
325342,just read it utter nonsense insane methodology if you can even call it that
325343,greycore will be pretty decentralized yeah and its just a stepping stone to the final version where everyone running nodes in ren participate in key generation and management
325347,no this shows token performance after raise announcement for the vcs themselves the profit is gonna be much higher than max_profit
325348,hey how much is metamask dependent on infura
325349,like if infura infra suffers an outage will metamask be unavailable for all users
325351,yes
325354,you can do that with lifinance as we have connext and nomad implemented whereby connext allows additional contract calls on the destination chain and nomad to send messages nomad is atm restricted to 3 chains but theyll add the big 6 within the next 34 weeks feel free to dm me
325357,so apply to ivan i think its just fair setting up some incentives if youre posting it here without clearly disclosing its not officially endorsed by lobster dao
325365,feel free to share a link here short description genuine builders needing feedback r welcole
325366,do anyone know who did shib back then was it all planned by some big devs whales maybe anyone found any info on it
325367,slightly outdated
325368,thank
325369,all of this info is made up and proven to be false very long ago waste of time to read
325370,yea
325371,metamask is entirely dependent on infura as well as etherscan
325372,it uses etherscan to verify the responses from whatever rpc its connected to on mainnet only
325373,is ohm just proposing a fixed period staking or what is it i cant quite understand a lot of complex wording
325374,yeah i think its fixed maturity bondsim still unclear if this is intended to replace their current inflationary staking
325375,they mention that its tokenized bonds therefore trade like actual erc20s in the market at par premium or at a discount of the value plus interest
325376,yeah these numbers are dog shit
325377,does anyone here have a list of all crypto options protocols that are currently up and running lyra premia dopex are the only ones i have heard of
325378,ribbon finance is another
325379,
325381,ribbon doesnt have any options for me to buy or sell though right it just seems like its an automated strategy that uses options to generate yield but thinking of rbn reminds me i guess there is also opyn but it doesnt seem that accessible since its only on l1 currently
325382,yeah its kinda like jonesdao
325383,imo dopex is probs the best and i really like arb
325385,unrelated anyone knows where one can watch the superbowl online
325387,why is dopex the best i tried looking at that thing and it didnt even really seem to allow you to sellbuy puts lol imo that makes it worthless in terms of an options platform
325388,theyre releasing puts very soon
325389,pods finance its on eth polygon arbitrum
325390,and where the best place to place a bet using crypto
325395,thanks all for the responses will be checking these over the next day or so
325396,crazy iv movements recently huh
325398,is rdl a zombie project
325401,sonicblend yes saw stepn and genopets very interesting
325402,i think lyra is one of the best options protocols out there good quality team and ux is comparitavely great
325410,a bit difficult to understand what they are doing and if can have value in the web3 any idea
325411,aave on polygon has problems with matic again
325412,is it from meta
325413,thats libra
325414,hes probably about turkish lira
325415,to reiterate all the above yields do not represent vc investment performance but only measure the reference significance of financing information for investors investors can use the financing background as one of the criteria for judging the merits of the project but it is not suitable for followon investment after all we do not know the true cost price and exit price of vcscalculates the yield current priceprice on the date of publication max profit highest price since publicationprice on the date of publication and max loss lowest price since publicationprice on the date of publication since the release of financing information
325416,so its useless thx for confirming
325417,dont think thats the claim
325418,i think he is just saying that involvement of big vcs in seed doesnt mean its profitable for retail in public market or for vcs in future rounds which we already know just some numbers to justify that i guess
325419,they basically have a standard for media files a distributed network to serve those files consider the implications from therethey should have a wp somewhere
325420,you guys saw haw thomasgeth arrow founder almost got scammed
325421,yes
325422,pretty high effort really for those that didnt see that here is the thread
325423,his focus on the intricacy of the scam rather than realising it has to do with doxxing his eth address as well as adding his real name is a complete clown show
325424,indeed the actual attack vector was asking for token approval not a genius iq attack
325426,the process that led to it is an unconventional one maybe
325427,well technically it was not complicated but the backstory and social engineering part seems pretty advanced tho
325428,
325429,yes i saw the wp really impressed and also technicalnot easy to understand if you are not expertanyway looks a solid project imao
325431,wrt that arrowthomasg attack is someone else also receiving emails from random gmail accounts which say ethopian airlines booking confirmed or victorias secret payment done such emails i am receiving dont have any direct attachment dont hit spam filters but have a link which eventually redirects to a legit innocuous homepage my guess is that clicking the link is first downloading some script before redirecting to the legit site no phishing i am unable to just hover and find the first link as my email service obscures it with safelinkprotection domain but of course its doing no good a job at protecting me
325432,is there a service where i could paste the link as my email provider shows me which would simulate all the redirections and show if anything harmful gets downloaded
325433,best to just ignore those emails mark as spam everyone gets them to one degree or another sign up to haveibeenpwned it is a legit website go verify on wikipedia etc their free service will notify you if your web2 accounts have ever been compromised if youve been in crypto for a while its quite possible that at some point in time an ico or something has been hacked and spammers might be targetting your email addressyou can investigate these things in an incognito browser window but i wouldnt bother tbh especially not if youre unsure of what youre doing
325434,i am curious to know whats happening at the same time dont want to take the effort to spin a vm
325435,also this isnt phishing cos the ethopian airlines email eventually redirects to google flights search
325436,i am curious to know whats happeningseems abundantly obvious your email has been leaked
325437,that aside
325438,ask hn is gmail spam out of control for everyone else tooarticle comments
325439,bitcoin solves this
325440,
325442,
325443,never would have expected lol
325444,i think this only checks links against a database of reported links since my email service masks the underlying link with its own security protection redirection link the site doesnt really work
325445,i know my address is being attacked i am trying to figure what the attack is as its not the usual phishing link asking me to reset my password or even requiring login
325446,if you know how to use the command line perhaps the curl command will help you can pass in a url and tell it to follow redirects and let you know where it ends up see
325447,feel free to dm me with an example shortened url and ill test it for you
325448,great
325449,additional option not sure if it checks redirects but a good resource nonetheless
325450,doesnt seem like it did the email service has masked the first level of redirection these services just seem to be checking against a database of the domain asis pasted
325451,i shared the screenshot of the emails and the link with sonic sonic is testing out the link but otherwise the email looks totally harmless so its a very interesting attack if we figure what the attack actually is
325452,also if the attack is sophisticated the redirection service the attacker is running would change the output based on where the call is made from so any known security services are potentially useless unless they keep changing their own ips
325454,you could run a sandbox and visit
325455,search google for sandboxie
325456,will give you a temp partition away from the rest of your system
325457,risking being banned by ivangbi here but quick shill as we have a community callannouncement today
325458,is this finally mainnet soon
325459,everything ready to deploy mainnet will depend on the community we are passing the baton to them thats what the whole unlock launch its about
325460,tldr basically we have encrypted everything we have produced we are selling nfts and granting the nft holders a decryption key decryption key owners need to coordinate to decrypt the content each type of nft have different decryption power
325461,gtfo of here
325462,this whitepaper is half a page
325463,at least its in latex ig
325464,it literally does not even have a paragraph in their whitepaper
325465,rss3 what next telnet3
325466,its 7 pages long
325467,fuuuuuu
325468,dm
325469,your right 7 pages too long
325470,
325471,hey gang proud to share we deployed on avax
325472,do you guys have any update on this seen nothing in discord or tg announcement its the october hack
325473,lol probably rss3 has a notion page as a blog and a wiki the blog has more details i started looking into it but gave up when i saw only 5 gets sold to the public in the ongoing lbp current price is 041 private sale bought between 006 015 with a 12 month cliff whilst seed got in at 004 with a 24 month cliffas i understand from the whitepaper they use a mongodb instance to store usercurated rss feed details adding removing and ordering entries requires a signature via metamask they plan to replace mongodb with a client written in go which they may or may not have started codiing yet i was too lazy to ask their devs about this but i had kinda lost interest at this point oh yeh token is a purely governance token with no clues how it could be monetised yet
325474,i like mirrorxyz as a competitor to medium there are quite a few twitter clones but so far theres not been a compelling enough incentive to attract people away from twitter
325475,oh yeh take a look at lens protocol but its too early afaik not public yet
325476,i agree ser have come to same conclusion after the research tnx
325477,
325478,
325479,
325480,i know that warp postponed their v2 launch because of this hack quite complicated i guess trial of bits is doing their audit
325481,hey guys can anybody help me i have been selected at an crypto related company for a non tech role but i need to understand the basic mechanism of all this to excel at my interview
325482,read the bitcoin whitepaper
325483,probably still the best blockchain explainer video
325484,gotoetherscancomrdb21workingweb3
325485,
325486,thank you so much guys
325487,also its an crypto auditing firm
325488,so can you give some basic resources on that too
325489,check out firstcmicheliohowtobecomeasmartcontractauditordevanshxyzblockchainsecurity20210917genesis0x01htmlwwwnotonlyownercomlearnintrosecurityhackingsmartcontractsethereum
325490,
325491,its strange how the domain is now up for sale
325492,thank you guys will check these all out and come back
325493,im dumb but how did something like this happen shouldnt the devs have just said no
325494,no to what
325495,no were not giving you ownership of the token contract
325496,its like a 51 attack so you would need to have more votes that say no to stop it
325497,shouldnt common sense have kicked in ive seen snapshot proposals where its like gib dev share plox devs say no or is this an automated process
325498,its fully on chain governance with build
325499,you would have to vote to defend
325500,so they got rekt
325501,oh ok got itthanks
325502,hostile takeover with the most hostile of outcomes
325503,reminds me of the corporate raiders in the 80s
325504,why is this news
325505,dao is working as intended
325506,its noteworthy but no injustice was done really working as intended their fault for having an illiquid shitcoin as their gov token
325507,nobody said anything about injustice interesting example of what can happen if you fully commit to on chain governance news worthy to me
325508,blockfi agrees to pay 100 million in penalties and pursue registration of its crypto lending product link
325509,mb fault was not holding majority
325510,100m penalties and they still pursue that means they must see massive upside baller move
325511,thats something that can be prevented with sybil checks biometrics or social vouchers whats the other possible way to eliminate this attack completely
325512,this is the first case of its kind with respect to crypto lending platforms sec chair gary gensler said todays settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with timetested securities laws such as the securities act of 1933 and the investment company act of 1940 it further demonstrates the commissions willingness to work with crypto platforms to determine how they can come into compliance with those laws
325513,quoting almost 100 year old antiquated legislation is a joke
325514,just because you add a brockshane to the mix doesnt make it special though
325515,apparently come into compliance means gib 100 mill to govt
325516,aaand its enough legal for today
325521,this is so wrong
325522,if youre willing to research i would look into nick johnsons durin or rari capitals nova
325523,oooooh
325524,
325525,
325526,since when i know of 0 de fuk
325527,how many daos exist totally 10 of
325528,its the same as saying 60 of all projects have been created on bsc chain doesnt speak to the quality just the quantity
325529,you can just make any wallet a dao with a cpl of clicks there so wallet equals dao notice heavy use of qoutes
325530,would anyone know how to stop a wallet automatically sending eth out that gets sent in
325531,
325532,hey community if youre not a whale yet and not a developer but still want to contribute fulltime to the space consider joining the new hackathon for nondevs theres over 10k in prizes up to 30k in bounty prizes from amazing sponsors
325536,hey everyone ive been wondering something about the nfts royalties systemis there currently a way for nfts to generate royalties for the creator or owner not when the nft is sold but when it is viewed lets say for example that im an artist and i create a unique nft but instead of selling it i get a fee every time someone has a look at the nftdoes a similar system already exist and if not would the current nfts smartcontract system permit it
325537,there are some protocols that do this automatically royalties yes
325538,views are off chain so it would be problematic to connect it with onchain actions
325539,and it wouldnt be possible to make an onchain like action on each view like a temporary reveal process after paying a fee for example
325540,can i ask you for some names please
325541,well technically you can add something like reveal button that will trigger on chain tx but it will come with a tx cost and terrible ux
325542,for one
325543,are there any nft marketplaces without royalties or fees
325544,i dont imagine this happening on the current state of nfts marketplaces on eth but glad to know that its technically possible thanks for your input
325545,will have a look ty
325546,the link above the point of blockchain was origionally to remove the middleman but then opensea decided to be a middleman
325548,yes see they are doing attention based rewards koiinetwork
325549,please continue this in nft_avenue
325550,will do sorry
325551,what are some good resources that include commonly used financialtechnical terms in defi
325552,i built this glossary you can steal to build a real repo
325553,thank you i appreciate it
325554,
325555,
325556,lol cute threat
325557,that cannot be 0xb1
325558,must be some zealous intern on social
325559,its not a security when theyre profiting off of it and not its not in the docswe didnt really notice it when the number is going up
325560,lol its very much in line with 0xb1
325561,but just my 2c
325562,doesnt everyone in the space know that founders of projects are rich why do people still get surprised when get details of how much teams are actually making
325563,theres a difference between detailing how much is made and that demented threat
325564,i wasnt supporting 0xb1 in fact i was questioning the first tweet too who is he to say team members cant make 500k a month teams raise 50 to 100m every other day these days and ofc no one knows how it exactly gets spent
325565,additonally the celsius team itself is probably super rich and actually has fiduciary duties to its depositors and yet played with 0xb1 so it was a hypocritic comment to begin with anyway
325570,hello everyone just wanted to ask im a developer who has been interested in the web3 space id love to pick up freelance paid tasks where would you guys recommend i check out
325571,gotoetherscancomrdb21workingweb3
325572,check this
325573,i dont think 0xb1 is celsius anymorea while back they said they gave the acc to someone else
325574,thank you
325575,thank you
325576,so solidly is the new name i remember it was solidswap
325577,nice thread on uni v3 and curve v2
325578,who are top 10 devs in crypto atm
325579,how would you quantify this amount a dev has shipped success of the projected they worked on users using the product they worked on pretty subjective metric unless these are outlined imo
325580,yeh not asking for an acurate list just devs u respect the most in general
325581,i dont know because theyre all anonymous and keep setting up new profiles
325582,nour zefram anish come to mind
325583,banteg t11s ross campbell on there too
325584,craig wright
325586,more importantly can they do something
325587,hello sirs anyone here running an avax node or anyone knows the current blockchain size for the historical node
325588,interesting question i always wonder whether theres a crypto award to do similar work such as mvdmost valuable developer mvmmost valuable meme people votemaybe use a tokenfor candidates and the winner gets awarda certification nft
325589,just wondering who to follow talk to
325592,none they are all trash
325593,the dude working on gearbox is pretty good no the minting site he made looked good fast execution interesting concept
325594,respectable defisafety score too i might add
325595,gn lobster fam compiled a thread with methodology and tools for investigating crypto hacks and security incidents twittercomofficer_ciastatus1493395239905734667
325596,probably better than the us department of justice atm
325597,just some thoughts and anecdotes on this whole looksrare debacle delete if you think its been spoken about too much i cant tell from looking up as it may have already been redacted as many people have stated and which was clear from early on or potentially right from the start of the airdrop i cant tell if was amended at some point post airdrop the issue re tokenomics of the teams lockup being staked and earning weth only not looks doesnt in my opinion deserve such outcry is it that bad should the team have taken a greater risk building this platform a large feat which to me is a far better ux than os for browsing and trading nfts in my opinion its a non issue the money grabbing twotoken incentive mechanics enabling the team to essentially lower their financial risk of the project by almost guaranteeing a weth payout which does not directly affect looks price negatively and even possibly has a positive effect on price as some might be compounding looks using weth rewards i dont see the issue an airdrop of this sort kind of needs some smart gamified tokenomics to raise capital for team remuneration and project runway is it so outrageous that they should raise capital this way in my personal opinion not if the platform was shit i would say there would be some reason for the fud and name calling but pretty objectively the product is not shit there have been hugely questionable airdrops fair launches and moneygrabs surrounding projects that got far less outcry than looks which really had very little downside risk for not only the seed and team but also for any airdrop recipients or speculators credit where credit is due there should be some competition for opensea and looksrare to me seems like a decent candidate disclosure i own an insignificant to me amount of looks
325598,step 1 learn rust
325599,step 1 learn programming paradigm and cs step 2 learn any programming language
325600,its a fair take i wouldnt say that the mechanism they used to ensure a good payout is bad but like the saying goes show me the incentives and i will show you the outcome in this case the incentive of the core shareholders is to wash trade the platform to mars since they collect majority of the eth back while at the same time farming massive percent of the future issued looks tokens as wash trading rebate on the opposite side this is only important for users that want to play the game speculate and it was clearly written in the paper so if somebody got burned while trying to speculate read better next time
325601,does anyone know if axies ronin chaiin is open sourced
325602,i cant seem to find it anywher
325603,i disagree the mechanism ensures the payout it might as well have flopped like many other attempts before them and they wouldve ended up w nothing people give too much shit to the team and forget it has shipped a unique working product its quite an achievement for a team of anons
325604,sorry let me make sure i understand what youre saying correctly are you implying that the team and or seed investors were the ones doing wash trading if so do you have data to back this up
325605,how can you be sure that its the team wash trading
325606,mb team did take a part in wash trading but i know some people who did this too and have no connections to the team
325608,i am sorry but blockchain 101 is a wikipedia article please dont bring that here and read kore cia sent a bunch of golden stuff its too basic for here is0095
325609,hey i wasnt bringing anything here i just wanted to verify my learning from the people here before my interview
325610,sir it was really off if you said that at the interview it would have ended immediately please reread everything quite literally
325612,thats all it is a maybe or probable incentive its not a guaranteed outcome idk but this looks stuff has got me triggered im all for a bit of skepticism but as it stands they have done nothing wrong why are we casting our worst fears on a anon team that pulled off a well executed launch
325613,bitcoin is not a private blockchain you audit not because of just human loopholes but because there is no formal verification on ethereum per se so its more than that the rest was wikipedia quotes so it couldnt have been really off anyway gl studying it but it was very very raw enough on this
325615,
325616,thanks
325617,i think he should add damnvulnerabledefi ctf in there too its really fun and teaches a lot
325619,guide on what to do if u get compromised
325620,how does new nodes connect in fantom dag model is there a priority on which node to connect or it will connect to as many nodes as possible to ensure higher reward function based on the height of the nodes
325621,go read the code base
325622,metamask is revamping the way they manage networks specifically they are going to be curating networks and only allowing the service providers they want to be able to provide default rpc access
325623,is not correct unless something has changed in the last week sure you do get that obnoxious warning but it doesnt prevent you from hitting save
325624,hey lobsters is there a way to short massets mnflx and so on onchain today
325625,hey there anyone here has good technical knowledge about publishing nfts from custom smart contracts not the default collections from openseararibleim struggling to understand if my use case is supported by these marketplaces or if i need to build something custom myself
325626,it shouldnt be a red warning they should use yellow instead
325627,i hate how there are no reliable alternatives for all edge cases
325628,yes on mirror protocol you can short it
325629,yeah they tweeted again about it
325630,reading the academic paper is there a way to tell which validators are using which kind of algorithm for node selectionor any discussion about which would be the most preferable ones
325631,any chads got close end formula to calc curve v2 il
325632,when you say learn programming paradigm what would you suggest as a start a few nonprogrammer friends ask me this and i dont really know the answer apart from try one at a time
325634,i didnt make the issue
325635,metamask refuses to let dapps and users control rpc changing on default networks other than to protect infura usage
325636,here
325637,saw this msg and tried to find a list of top devs in crypto but couldnt find one so just now i made one haha
325638,sorry if i missed some more devs will try to keep it updated
325639,nice wheres my credit hhh
325640,gave you idea credit in the tweet ser
325641,yeah i know just saying the issue isnt correct at least until a week ago you cant change the infura stuff unsurprisingly consensys owns both of them after all but you can add another network with the same chain id the red notanerror is an interesting perception hack though
325642,ashachaf
325643,is this accurate solid emissions start on feb24th and not in 2 days
325644,yes 24th
325645,why would andre say its on 17th
325646,because he hates you
325647,nan
325648,there it is
325649,
325650,
325651,not sure if it was posted before so here i am
325652,blockminded your favorite chain seems like they are scaling to 41 validators this time
325653,nan
325654,since when you cant change ethereum rpc its literally locked for editing in metamask
325655,add the new rpc as a new chain
325656,cant wait boosting the throughput of bsc
325657,41 will be the total number of nodes left standing
325658,when it requires 50tb of nvme
325659,lemme try that
325660,what are they forking now or do they intended to keep scaling by increasing constants
325661,just a rebrand for now
325662,not forking idk what they will actually do not much details i think its just rebrand for now but tech people might slide into github perhaps
325663,they have to wait for something to build something worth forking first
325664,just add a new one works even if it says the chain id is resevved
325665,bnb chain is comprised of bnb beacon chain previously binance chain bnb chain governance staking voting bnb smart chain bsc previously binance smart chain evm compatible consensus layers and with hubs to multichains
325666,yeah it worked
325667,they didnt contribute to geth which would have been the boss move instead they got erigon to save their asses
325668,the announcement is talking about scaling from one chain to multichain and boosting the throughput of bsc thats why i asked
325669,yeah by doing what haha scaling to 41 validators
325670,thats why the new name build n build
325671,20 validators
325672,21 extras in case one of the 20 block proposers chokes
325673,so consensus doesnt change afaik
325674,yeah nothing changes
325675,multichain hub is it moving to a cosmos like architecture
325676,41 vallidators with the current latency seems like a night mare
325677,ah it doesnt actually mean the validator set is 41 20 of them would be reserves
325678,since metamask decided to go vc
325679,since metamask enabled swaps really
325680,there is literally zero reasons to have it like that
325681,
325682,except good for business
325683,you may disagree with it but that neither affects their bottom line in a meaningful way nor makes it notareason
325684,that one and another 3 ctfs are suggested in cmichels article in andres tweet
325685,at least it isnt a certain fruit company that doesnt allow people to use other browsers but i digress
325686,hi lobsters i wanted to share my quarterly reminder that a friend and i run archivenodeio a public good for ethereum devs to have free access to archive nodes for whatever purposewe dont collectsell data or plan to profit ever or anything weird like that
325687,it will soon affect their bottom line that i can promise you
325688,the first link should be the yellow paper
325689,b a s i c s
325690,
325691,yay
325692,someone was asking about this here few days back
325693,chase is a legend
325694,100 he gets all the credit for archivenode i just yell at people on the tweeter about it
325695,
325696,wait so the red chain id error is not actually an error
325697,it worked for me when i clicked and txs went through so i guess not
325698,6 years using metamask i feel betrayed and dumb now
325699,create a different one or do they only allow for one chain id
325700,ssmccul
325701,you can add it manually
325702,the problem though is if ur using flashbotsopenmevedennetwork etc is if you switch tabs or close it and bring metamask back up it will resend the tx to the public mempool
325703,challenges and opportunities for founders building web3 projects
325704,can someone confirm that this does indeed work because for me it does not i see the red warning i can click on save but the network does not get added i am on firefox and latest metamask version 1092
325705,yes it works for me as well i use brave though fed up of infura issues so i permanently moved to pokt rpc now
325707,bdw anyone used poktpool blockspace or some other fraction pool for pokt staking just wanna check whats the safest option when you dont wanna run a pokt node directly
325708,in addition to poktpool tpokt was just launched by the thunderhead team they give you a receipt token ala lido hopefully they can build some good defi integrations with itthunderpoktfi
325709,lobs any good description of how bribecrvfinance works timelines of bribes and claims any extra rules etc unlike votium im struggling to figure it on my own
325710,it is i just added the pokt rpc
325711,while the original infura will still be there just use different name easy for you to identify
325712,just a subtle shill dexguru announced 5m round somethingsomething is coming soon for lobsters
325713,thanks ser
325714,much better than a google docs sheet
325715,i wanna die why is this a dao please cancel
325716,suka
325717,is there any discord server of lobster dao
325718,bridged with lobsterdao kingdom and vice versa
325719,wdyt abt ankr
325720,gracias
325721,ibc ftw
325722,anyone catch that v1 whitepaper on daily ape did darren get hacked strong clickbait
325723,i think missclick
325724,was a misclick
325725,nan
325726,darren has no sex its okay he does it
325727,ill click you any day
325728,nan
325729,i did the dd send saft
325730,you can sigma dd
325731,im just happy whitepapers are back
325732,theres an edx course for python with eric grimson this is a great introductory thing to do
325733,nemo and cia especially are so fucking productive bloody chads so are amplice mugglesect cryptographic
325734,ser i just shitpost
325735,does this mean i dont get banned for shitposting
325736,has anyone tried this new wallet called rabbyheard some great stuff abt it
325742,hey guys are there any other bounty platforms for freelance web30 work besides layer3
325743,immuneficom has the biggest bounties but theyre bug bounties only so technical expertise is requiredalso gitcoin has lots of bounties there are a bunch of others too
325744,thanks i do know flipside crypto has bounties for data related dashies too
325745,feel free to join codeless conduct a hackathon focussed on nondeveloper bounties codelessconductorg
325746,hi everyone i was looking into yearn strategies and i found this one based on scream protocol didnt find any audit or source to verify the reliability of this protocol do you know any source thanks
325747,can anyone explain how this is possible on ropsten an address that was never funded with eth was able to make a txn which obviously failed
325748,
325749,ded
325750,looks like ropsten gas price was 0 in may 2017 so maybe you dont need ether to send transactionthe failed was contract call status but transaction was good landed on chain
325751,wildfire dao lives
325752,is this legit seen posted in another groupairdropclaim your acre airdrop at if you hold snxavaxpng on september 25th or lobster dao nft on december 9thdyor if safu or not
325753,yes already claimed mine
325754,
325755,is it true
325756,he invested in nubank to be precise
325757,is there any thread out here about earning yield on eth where to put them for a decent
325758,you can always check and then doublecheck yourself for rates if thats what youre looking for
325759,and you can also find this thread useful
325760,just reading this will check yours as well i am interested in eth or weth
325761,oh wait mine is about stables scratch that
325762,
325763,ive been in a couple of those fantom vaults for a week or two and i gotta admit that the apy didnt match my expectations not even the weekly apy matches the return that said i have no idea how those apys are calculated most prob on previous performance
325771,anyone have opinions on the top legal firms covering blockchain ideally with a us focus
325772,yearn acknowledges they have an issue with apy calculation
325773,options vaults are p good for this
325775,ok job by cooley dlx wilon sonsini proskaeur rose among others
325776,oh my god
325777,appreciate it
325780,bot 20
325781,is there any place where to see the accurate rates for yearn something on the line of vfat and such perhaps
325782,coindixcom soon
325783,we are working to get close to real apy for yearn
325784,based on onchain data
325785,that sounds awesome soon like this quarter or soon underfined xd
325786,the leveraged and inglorious samaritans
325787,what
325788,utter nonsense
325789,the problem with measuring apy is that profit is only recognized by vault accounting on harveststrategyreport sometimes weeks can go by between harvests you could averageamortize harvest profit over time but that means users need to stay in the vault for x days before they can actually withdraw and recognize their profits theres a set of degenuneducated users who only keep deposits on the service for a few days at a time and they make a huge stink if there arent any harvests over that interval i think ultimately the solution is going to require contextualizing why someone wants to know what the apy for a vault is then providing a number and measurement methodology that will fit their use case valued yearn contributornot me
325790,these recent comments and subsequent discussions may be of interest to you
325791,it should also be pointed out that theres basically 2 ways to do auto compounders permissioned autocompounding and permissionless autocompoundingin a former the protocol triggers compoundingharvest events pays for the gas and is entrusted with making sure the harvest event isnt sandwiched by mev bots in the latter compounding is triggered permissionlessly usually on depositwithdraw users have to eat the gas cost of compounding everyones investment and compounding events can be easily sandwiched because you cant force your users to use something like flashbots rpc
325792,or this tweet by joey
325793,thanks for the heads up on the apy guys anything about contract audits
325794,which contracts are you interested in audits for all the audits for all strategiescontracts are here
325795,screamsh contracts does yearn perform any kind of audit on the utilized protocols
325796,how would u stop eth from being automatically transferred out of a wallet everyone time its put in
325797,the strategy vetting process is documented here right now theres a rudimentary risk analysis framework thats used to figure out which strategies need additional security attention i believe screamsh is a compound fork so its strategy will be genlevcompound theres a public risk dashboard available on yearn watch here if you see a strategy with a high risk score then its probably getting an audit some time soon
325798,thanks a lot
325799,there is a bot on discord also yearnwatch shows averaged aprs over last 10 harvests or yearnvision
325800,thank you
325801,looks like earning something on eth is really hard
325802,nice that would do the job for me thanks a lot
325803,the puts and calls are auctioned off every friday the ribbon team recently put together a new ui for you to bid in the auctions
325804,im trying to make a monitor that notifies me of any transaction where an nft erc721erc1151 is minted aka transfer from null address to x address on eth is there a way to be able to monitor for this without having the abi of the original function that is called in the transaction im using ethersjs to do this also apologies if thats not the appropriate place for such question
325805,scream is just a compound v2 fork no need for audits
325807,now we need to collect funds to send these students to conferences about fiscal responsibility
325808,
325809,thats what ppl say but something is usually altered in the code i remember grim ftm autocomponder was just a fork of beefy but they got exploited from changing 1 line iirc
325810,i recommend reaching out to flashbots discord for help it sounds like an exploited wallet and they can usually help out
325811,yes flashbots use the whitehat hotline
325812,what is the normal deadline for swapping tokens on chains like fantom
325813,deadlines are protocol specific not chain specific dont worry about it
325814,so i can just not provide this argument for func
325815,oh no you still need to provide it just as you would on uniswap or we on eth
325816,if youre doing it manually just google the current unix time 20 mins
325817,thanks
325818,well you can check if there are any changes in the code there are tools for that from defi summer i believe or were those only for the master chef contract
325819,
325820,token emissions go to stakers not traders thats neat if youre not into wash trading also neat if youre into low apy
325821,arrhgg i hate it when a protocol doesnt incentivise wash trading shakes fist
325822,their work in the comments and trying to bark on other projects was so pleb they forgot to focus on what makes them somehow unique and instead just cried all around idk meh strategy
325825,you can still see which parts were modified from the original compound contracts and try to see if its ruggeable
325826,even if you make each view a tx i think it raises the question of dare i say it why people wouldnt right click save it
325827,does anyone know if l2 solutions can be applied to evm compatible l1s particularly avax
325828,you mean if you can fork say optimism and run as an l2 on top of avax
325829,yeap
325830,in theory it should be possible i doubt its just a plugplay solutiondepends also on how optimism or whatever software youre using is implemented do they assume theyre working under ethereums consensus rules can those be easily tuned
325831,essentially it should work but maybe not in a secure way out of the box
325832,thanks im thinking the same curious about this scenario
325833,layer 2s would need to get traction on eth first before people start forking them onto other layer 1s
325834,true
325838,when we do a signature on metamask is there a way to extract the ecdsa v r s values
325839,from the entire signature string
325840,its literally splitting the hex string in 3 parts r sig031 s sig3263 v sig64
325841,not sure if im saying the correct order though
325842,thanks a lot ser
325843,is there an online tool that can run ecdsarecover
325844,i dont know i would usually write a oneoff script myself
325845,hm when i create a signature on myetherwallet i obtain a hex string thats much longer than 64 digits dont they use ecdsa
325846,into into mew now to test this im assuming youre looking at the sig field thats in a string with 130 chars which when results in 65 bytes total which is the correct byte length for a signature
325847,nan
325848,the last part 1c is 0x1c 28 which is the v
325849,the rest can be split in half to get r and s
325850,sorry but again i dont know how to put this into a more nontechnical approach
325851,thanks a lot ser so i need to convert chars into a hex number somehow
325852,for r and s
325853,well depending on what youre doing you can just split them in half manually as they arejust understand that each of them is not to be read as 64 character string but as a 32byte value
325854,and how do you convert a 32byte value into hex
325855,any tool youd be using will do it for you maybe just need to prepend a 0x to each of the 3 values
325856,thank you
325857,out of curiosity because of the timing is this for x2y2 smart contract
325858,yes but no idea if it works im a noob obviously trying to stitch the pieces together via google
325859,anyone know a site that publish vesting schedule calendar of unlocking tokens of popular tokens or at least a few
325860,is there a way to research about this better than going to each tokens smart contract and read i couldnt read that in white paper usually it just informs the month and not the date
325862,
325863,hm apparently v needs to be either 27 or 28 in my signature its 1 though
325864,signature ends on 01
325865,are you sure it doesnt end in 1b or 1c
325866,nan
325867,does the message i sign have to be in a specific format
325868,now a group of the uss biggest crypto players have rolled out their solution in the form of trust anchorage avanti bitgo bitflyer bittrex blockfi circle coinbase fidelity digital assetssm gemini kraken paxos robinhood standard custody trust symbridge tradestation zero hash and zodia custody make up the founding membersheaded by coinbase
325869,shouldnt have to i know there are some cases eip155 where 27 and 28 are not necessarily the result but i dont think 1 would be a possible choice maybe im running on outdated knowledge though
325872,delphi
325873,do you mean this one
325874,yes
325875,i couldnt see compiled vesting schedule on the site
325876,sorry i meant messari my bad
325877,theres allegedly a free trial and a public endpoint
325878,thank you
325881,i think you looking for this
325882,yo this is amazing tnx for sharing
325883,holy smokes
325884,is there a way to readsee variables when one debugs a simulated transaction on tenderly
325885,
325886,posting this here because it might be interesting for protocols that depend on a stable 3pool
325887,curve ramping up amplification from 2k to 5k
325888,anyone knows the four companies from here
325889,headquarters location minato city tokyo japan
325890,robinhood blockfi both had leaks i think
325891,japanese might know
325892,bitgo was hacked
325893,bitfinex too
325894,omg truly life saver thank you so much
325897,what software did you use to generate this signature ser
325898,is there a way to decodeencode a signature generated via myetherwallet such that the translated signature is in the correct ecdsa format ends on 1b or 1c
325899,i read that myetherwallet uses rlp encoding whatever that is but i dont find a rlp decoder
325900,
325901,yea im confused though rlp seems to be used to format the different fields of an ethereum transaction nonce gas price etc i only want to sign a message not a transaction so rlp shouldnt be relevant here should it
325902,this was myetherwallet i just randomly created a key there to try and see how it worked
325903,hm interesting when i create a new address on myetherwallet it indeed gives me a signature with 1b at the end but if i connect my ledger via metamask it gives me the 01 at the end
325904,yes thats correct
325906,cryptocast0x that stuff in lobsterdao
325907,in case ubuntu feels slow
325908,ok looks like its a bug on myetherwallet signatures are correct end in 1b or 1c when signing with a hot wallet but are incorrect when signing via a ledger both when connecting directly and when connecting via metamask is that a known issue
325909,i use ubuntu on one of my trading laptops and with cexs ui its horrible sometimes specially when market wide dump occurs or something it start to fly laptop isnt much old and with good specs will check it out thanks
325910,if you are not concerned with heat issues this might help ubuntu was setting all of the cores into powersave mode im on desktop so i set everything to performance
325911,is there another way to sign messages with ledger other than using mew
325914,you can try mycrypto
325915,ty ser but same problem
325916,let myhash be the keccak256 hash of mymessage in ecdsarecovermyhashvrs are vrs coming from the signature of myhash or from the signature of mymessage
325917,signature of myhash
325918,ecrecover is not aware of keccak hashes but since recover expects a bytes32 you cant just use arbitrary message lengths so you hash them first
325919,oh and also of course to avoid the raw message from being visible in the tx payload which is often required for privacy
325920,

325942,if case you havent seen
325943,guys who are the people on the multisig of scream
325944,better to ask that in their discord
325945,is it coming from geth client trying to see if i should run my own node if i wanna build an explorer
325946,i think they were announced in their twitter on its day
325947,ty
325948,you will need an archive node to run your own explorer
325949,i think that erigon is now running on bsc which lowers requirements
325950,but its still a hefty chain
325952,
325953,chad thanks supermassiveone 3
325954,wait is lobsters part there
325955,sorry if already shared this one b4psa it looks like theres a fake arbi pool in curve
325956,yeap should be removed thoon
325957,banteg can you tell me the name of that sweet app that tracked multisig member activity at yearn is it publicly available would love to use it
325961,nice basic explanation video inside on curves and invariants
325962,anyone know if there are alternatives to messaging services than what epns is building the ux is kinda iffy rn
325963,put together a little article on decentralized ui and defi
325965,not sure how the liquity example helps the case of the article anyone can create a ui for a contract decentralized ui means precious little
325966,it would be nice if we could run these uis as standalone html files on our own devices
325967,web bundles but itll probably take a certain fruit company a decade to get around to supporting it
325969,link
325974,sure anyone can create a ui but making sure there is an incentive there to maintain it is key liquity had it built in other daos sometimes use grants for this
325975,yes because ledger doesnt respect eip55
325976,no i left it out was running long so i kept it short for the muggles
325977,
325978,this is all getting to tiring
325979,
325980,brain melting
325981,
325982,the decision of projects bug me a little bit ib voting for their own shitcoin radial for their own shitcoin whos next counterproductive so far it seems they are just using andre to pnd their bags and their weight will never decrease
325985,ib pumped hard enough soon they announce next cream snapshot and pnd that one too though farming starts today and emissions next week or or everything next week
325986,this is one another one is just to become a bribe treasury another one is to vote for the lp tokens of iron bank as a protocol to give them more liquidity and make tvl larger voting for your own pool 2 is meh its not meh in a moralleas discussion but because projects dont get diluted like they do with vecrv they can keep doing this
325988,i think andre inserted votium inside the core codebase so it can be possible but i cant read code and there is lack of info so will wait and see smarter people say
325989,in the hypothetical case you are nice dev but dont know what to do with your project how can you find a good partner to manage the projecti dont think post a job offer is the proper solution im looking for some tips
325990,but isnt an important part of the emission structure the volumefees aka if your own pool 2 has deep liquidity but no volume it will get uninteresting for users
325991,nan
325992,nan
325994,nan
325995,cool feature nurses approve harithk17
325996,thanks much ser both the chat and nft page are super new will be improved on and as always appreciate any feedback
325997,literally just added this link if any legit projects want to try this out feel free to check it out or hit me up in the dmz
325998,omg cool stuff i am thinking about a platform allow nft owner can login by their nft and creat a chat circle
325999,collab land into discord has worked like this for a year gated chats are already old
326000,thx for sharing
326001,what is curves supply growth rate
326002,633k a day iirc
326003,does boosted lp for vecrv lockers take from other lps or awarded from curve inflation somehow
326004,to my knowledge boosts dont affect emissions
326005,in convex from boosted rewards for lps they take like 1015 from those and reserve for the token econ like given to stakers of cvx etc but afaik ye whether you are boosting or not does not affect total emitted amount just your weight
326006,yeah just takes from other lps by giving yourself more weight in the pool
326007,flat forever or and that all goes to pools apy i suppose any builtin apy bonus for pools that contain curve in them that eg multiples the apy given to such pools
326008,it reduces every year around augustno bonuses based on pool tokens just gauge weight
326011,thanks ser so can i simply add 27 to the last byte to create valid rsv values for ecdsarecoverhashrsv
326012,why are there now 17b curve on eth but release schedule shows 1b for this date just trying to understand and total supply at the top here shows 305b not 225b as above the purple it seems there are about 075b other tokens whenhow were those emitted cmc cg show max supply of 33b any added reason for that
326013,well thats not the max its just the timeline is getting cut off 3b is hundreds of years awayalso vesting tokens are already minted
326014,whats the formula for supplygrowth reductionso 33b max on cmc is just an error its really 303b
326015,does anyone know of any good technical resources on mainnet forking
326016,how much vecrv is needed for full 25x boost per lp size ie whats the formula
326017,
326018,
326019,
326020,how do i die
326021,centralized uis are trojan horses the wake up call shouldve been badgers hack
326022,lmao your just mad you didnt buy your house like that true genius
326023,this
326024,that attacker vector does not get smaller with more decentralized uis there is at least more potential for someone to deploy a manipulated version once the user is used to the idea that there can be more than one legit ui url scams will go wild
326025,i bought in cash and then sold at loss when moving out so i lost about 3 due to the fees otherwise the purchase was ok also 10 on inflation and thats next to me selling eth at 350 or so for that so overall yes i am ngmi to the max
326026,omg no why did i start counting this is like terrible fuck
326027,stop larping you are still rich
326028,when floor here is 100 eth then maybe
326029,but then klibansky will also be rich and thats impossible
326031,just learn some dance moves and promote it on tiktok floor will moon
326032,nothing is impossble sir
326038,hey guys i was looking to implement gasless mint on my nft collection on polygon does someone has already made it knows good documentation about it
326040,hi who can i talk to about cooperation
326042,lobsters dont cooperate only obliterate
326043,if someone needs a list of eth events
326044,except this only applies to pfp and nft can be so much more
326045,cant wait for the nice x2y2 stimmy
326050,whats this lobsterdao
326051,yes
326052,does it get you anything rn
326053,holding that
326054,go to lobsterdao for latest there is always some cool engagement in place yes
326055,less blabla spam please you flooding kinda
326056,whos paying for the gearbox def salaries as their was no sale
326057,ivan has a lot of stables
326058,there was a small contributor round mid of last year that is being used as bootstrap for audits first contributors by eoy or so dao treasury will take over dao treasury can take over now already it is starting up in tokens but usd costs the smol round covers for now
326059,random but dm me if gearbox needs an audit or formal verification
326061,is there a testnet deployment of the curve metapoolfactory somewhere
326066,hi does anyone can intro degenscore teamwant to know their story process for creating degenscore
326067,angelomint
326068,wow thanks
326069,i asked him before he said they wanted to scoring process to be a mystery
326070,actually not at that implementation detailbut like how long he implemented it the creative iteration process and any validation for checking the result before release
326071,that kind thing
326072,fwiw safe token confirmed 91 positive votes dunno if spam or if someone already shared this sorry if repost c
326073,does anyone have the article for that guy who discovered that you mint eth on arbitrumother eth l2 i did use control f but i dont know if im using the wrong sequence of words or maybe it wasnt posted
326074,it was optimism btw
326075,thanks sorry for some reason i thought it was arb that explains why i couldnt find it
326076,this does not do anything for hacks
326077,loooool
326078,what is the difference between signing a message and a transaction at a technical level is signing a message just proving that one owns the private keys where as signing a transaction is causing a state change
326080,what do you mean like for development purposes or contentious forking
326081,for development purposes i want to build a defi simulator that can run against current state wo using hardhat etc
326082,preferably in go
326083,i just found out about simulatedbackend in goethereum but dont know if i can use that yet
326084,even more general on some dexs when breaking a lp the approval is just sign this message then to actually break it sign this transaction
326085,transaction includes nonce gas price gas limit to value data
326086,both include vs r
326087,signing a message is just message the address of the private key it was signed with and the signature r s v
326088,that makes sense but since a signing a message does not modify state and is gasless it is just used in the example i gave to prove that i am the owner of these pks
326089,is there a tool that alerts you when your wallet receives a token on avax cchaintried to ctrlf but didnt find anything sorry if answered
326090,sure
326091,i assume you can sign into snowtraceio and setup an email alert in the same way that you can using etherscan
326092,try snowtrace
326093,etherscan runs snowtrace i imagine they have same functionality
326094,i have been testing out idex and comparing it to dydx both offchain clobs that settle data to a blockchainone is perps one is spotone is using xrks and eth one is settling to polygonetc etcbut in idex one has to sign a message to execute an order where in dydx this is not the case it is like using a centralized clob exchange
326095,hey at all hope you are doing fine i have one question can anyone tell me from which platform i can get automatically the market capitalization from smallshitcoins cause when i try it via the api from coin gecko i does not workthanks in advance
326096,we released a uni v3 oracle attack simulator in case anyone is interested can use it to make sure lending pools in euler rari and any other protocol using twaps have the right risk profile for your use case
326097,fbi is launching a virtual asset exploitation unit for blockchain analysis and virtual asset seizure link
326098,also highly recommended to start programming deep understanding of data computations from this classic book and mit video lectures
326099,if your metamask asks you to sign a message this message could be a transaction so be careful also with signing not sure what kind of protections metamask has in place there be especially wary if the thing your signing is a hash since i guess a valid ethereum transaction is just the transaction lumped together via rpl with the signed hash of the transaction so if someone wants to rekt you via a signature he only needs to get you to sign a hash i guess
326100,metamask will typically warn you whenever you sign a hash directly and dont use the proper signed message api
326101,how can i count a gasless trade on cowswap for tax purposes
326102,you paid the gas cost in the token you received i believe
326103,so would you say signing a message with metamask is always safe if there are no warnings
326104,me or the taker
326105,i have only used it a handful of times but every time i paid an equivalent fee of whatever the gas would have been in the token i received or swapped i cant remember which one look at the confirmation when your swap goes through
326106,thx
326107,you can try the different apis here
326108,i dont know enough about metamask internals to assess whether always safe is true
326109,eg see how they handle eth sign vs personal sign etc
326110,the former can be used to signed arbitrary tx while the latter cannot
326111,some of yall will find this tool extremely useful
326112,ahem mean finance
326113,mean finance is for dcaing this is for taking profit at a single price and dripping the resulting funds over months to years
326114,plenty of reasons youd want to spread out when you get access to sums of money
326115,microsoft mentioned the forta protocol in its article the badger dao attack was given as an example and how realtime threat detection can help prevent such cases
326116,i was actually looking for something like this but for interest bearing token i think its very useful for daos that invested in products like mstable save and use the apy to pay the operational cost
326117,single pricedoes the sell happen immediately its not clear from the article the steps suggests it happens every year much like a mean dca into usdc would
326118,look into overnightfi if i understood you correctly they build what you look for
326119,were working on something to separate principle from interest rights
326120,yeah sell happens immediately ill see if i cant clear that up
326121,thanks i will check it out
326122,stablecoin backed by yieldbearing stables with profits payed out every day
326123,maybe i should have been more explicit in the article the article focuses on founding team risk rather than stopping hacks although with uniswaps build pipeline its easy setup alerts to know if the website has be changed
326124,set reminder sell everything during conferences
326125,
326126,

326130,chad price
326131,hi
326132,just shilling ser nbd
326133,
326134,we like the the locke
326135,hmu in the dms if you want to learn more are a protocol dev interested in using it
326136,gl ser
326137,
326138,pls share discordtg when ready
326139,github has an api specifically for deployments you can run egcurl h accept applicationvndgithubv3json and get all sushiswaps interface deployments
326140,
326141,why are all the cool people tweeting about locke
326142,you dont know the legend that is will price
326143,i know brock but to my great shame dont think i know who will price is yet but i probably know his projects
326144,probably been paying too much attention to a different will
326145,many thanks
326147,gn lobs spotted a great web3 developer the target audience are javascript frontend developers roadmap hope youll like it twittercomofficer_ciastatus1494485303180017664s20ttbykziupsmry2fdriphlg
326148,any fantom validators herehow does the validation process for event block works after i batch a transaction into an event block i would need to sync up with other top nodes but does this means my event block is fully validated already or do i wait for my event block to become a root or my event block be part of a subgraph of an clothroatroposand how do i calculate the incentives of creating an event block i tried to find a formula in the research paper but can only find the cost function of syncing up with other nodes is there more incentives of taking in larger transactions
326149,do you have a list of articles to fully understand roll up the more i read about it the more i feel like i understand nothing about it
326150,
326151,in local chains both options have mainnet forking ganache too
326152,does anyone know how to revoke approvals in terra blockchain
326153,scammer belyakov so like i ape into dump protection pool weird name btw i just wanna know the base asset tbh then my usdc is there quoting options in case it falls to strike at 2100 i buy eth basically anything above that i collect premium which is about 15 annualized
326154,exactly almost like a limit order with 15apy on top
326155,what if before the experitation weekly period price drops below 2100
326156,do i buy at 2100 then and suffer the downside from there or no
326157,i assume that is no different to ribbon in that case or is it
326158,for nerds it is not exactly a limit order because it will only work on friday 8am utc like all the options in our universe and if the price on that maturity time is below 2100 you buy eth if the price drops to 1500 before friday and come back to lets say 2200 on firday 8am utc nothing will hapen you still getting 15 apy
326159,btw friday 8am utc is now
326160,i personally use both selling puts and selling covered call strategies means 1 i lock usdc 15 apr to buy eth when its 30 down in one week 2 i lock eth 20apr to sell it if eth is up 30 within a week
326161,not because i only want apr but because i am happy with this strategy buying low and selling high most people do oposite lol
326162,what dapp is this sir
326163,the cat icon shilling above opium
326164,i dont have tokens yet shilling hasnt been paid yet
326165,opiumfinance
326166,haha i was trying dopex in arbitrum this seems new
326167,whats the difference with dopex actually i am curious
326168,and with ribbon is there some tldr
326169,you can mint your cat on opium there is a button top left corner
326170,nan
326171,ribbon strikes are very close to the current prices usually
326172,juliankoh is that to maximize apy and who decides this market risk
326173,sorry i am not 100 familiar so blz shill
326174,they use lower strikes and no leverage opium uses as high strike as possible to sell and 12x leverage that makes more sense imo because it was some liquidations on ribbon and never on opium
326175,never say never
326176,but apr is nicer
326177,also i know on ribbon there are liquidations on options opyn and no liquidations on opium but here i need to look how exavtly they liauidate
326178,what is being liquidated actually into what like in what scenario
326179,like if i throw into the usdc vault w the same idea i just buy when it drops but i dont get eth not cash settled so just my usdc balance goes lower
326180,i havent used ribbon the thing in dopex is that you can provide liquidity in different strike price to earn their governance tokens as rewards in case your position expires in a loss they give rdpx tokens which in turn they use in the platform for buying options and stuff to create demand for that token i dont believe they have inbuilt strategies like the screenshot you posted
326181,i need to look guess your option is liquidated if underlying moves and you dont have enough collateral
326182,also ribbon used to take 20 fee from your profit
326183,in case of liquidation do you have concepts like dopex where they give rdpx tokens
326184,there is no liquidation on opium only can be slashing if eth moves too much in this case you just buy puts or sell calls eth no other rewards but the idea is interesing hm
326185,and of course because the strike price is changing algorithmically every friday as well your limit order is moving together with the price every week
326188,hey guys any chance someone knows a tool to track multisig signer activity on gnosis
326192,are they the screen above only had 51 min left till expiry
326193,was always 10 afaik
326194,guess yearn team has one maybe banteg milkyklim can help you
326195,what do you want specifically one option would be pool data from chain another is to use gnosis api for second one can get inspiration here
326196,risk is preset for ribbon depends on current implied volatility
326197,backtests show that we can maximize profits for covered call for example at some constant delta then strategys smartcontracts decide on strike and so on risk with choosing strike that is closer to that delta value
326198,for covered call delta 01 maximizes strategy outcomes so 01 is used to calculate future strike values
326200,that github links certainly helps thanks a lot
326201,thats delta 01 at 1 week to expiry right
326202,the problem with those emerging crypto option markets that they are not statistically stable so imo is better to asses risks with parametrs not historyin other words in 2017 one can backtest the strategy of being long eth and it would show perfect results until the local crash in other words you will always find local highs and lows on such backtest charts otherwise would be flat line the right question are those numbers statistically significant if you say you use moving window and revaluate results i guess they are noti would be careful with this imo it like driving a car looking at the back mirrow
326203,yep
326204,when you say as high as possible to sell do you mean that the premium should satisfy the apy target so the strategy is pretty much increasedecrease the strike until the total premium falls below the target
326205,nope the strike is 3035 to spot
326206,yes one should be carefull with predicting future based on past performance but that definitely adds to strategy understanding
326207,the premium is an auction that starts from minimum
326208,what is that based on is it just an educated guess
326209,eventually its users choice to take the position that particular strategy offers and backtests help user to choose but they do not guarantee future performance
326210,it is lowest liquid delta possible
326211,got it thanks
326212,
326215,gm sers any terra wizards in here that could give me a hand was trying some swaps using the market swap mint and burn function but i just dont really understand how the 50bps fees are calculated
326216,
326217,this is my tx i thought it was the 47122uusd but this turns out to be 96bp fee
326220,why not price them on a supplydemand basis and allow price to decrease automatically if there are no buyers a bit like a dutch auction essentially
326221,are you concerned this rekts lps sellers because volume interest for defi options is not big enough yet
326222,shh youll expose qcps masterplan satire
326225,as a polygonbased project whats the downside of launching our project erc20 token on polygon and bridging to ethereum i see other polygon project eg quickswap do the opposite
326226,hi lobsters a fren of mine is in the starting phase of creating his own p2e game for the blockchain part he wants to hire a dev firm is there anyone in here who can help him with this which companies should he reach out to thanks
326227,do ethaave bpt stakers in the aave safety module receive aave protocol fees or just balancer trading fees and aave rewards
326228,if its above v13 it can be indexed using the safe tx service in tracing mode
326229,the downside is that you cannot use the main bridge but integrate with third parties such as celer or multichain then maybe less secure
326230,
326232,
326233,why less secure
326235,btw another downside is that if you want to bridge your token to other sidechains you would have to bridge from mainnet so its just easier to mint the token on mainnet and move other chains through their official bridges instead of relying on third parties
326236,makes sense
326237,what you should be thinking is the future maintenance of third party bridges about the other scenario
326238,official bridges only support ethereum having the master contract i wouldve thought eth competitors would support the other direction
326239,i ctrlfd so now i will ask is there any good posts comparing the dev tools and general workflows infrastructure between evm and solana
326240,their consensus is different programming stack is different so that would be like comparing the benefits of speaking russian versus french
326241,french has like 0 developers
326242,is there any way to discover an oracle from the erc20 address on chain
326243,uniswap v3 twap if its on univ3
326244,then chainlink or band there arent so many to check honestly
326245,the main issue i have is discoverability there doesnt seem to be a contract where you pass the erc20 address and you grt back the oracle address
326246,but will check uni twap too
326247,nope there isnt
326248,you can use chainlink feed registry but the amount of pairs is limited
326249,yeah is there anything like twap for sushi
326250,sadly there isnt
326251,we were waiting for it when trident was announced and then we got rugged because also trident was announced with twaps but in the end it seemed to need off chain proof
326252,kinda f
326253,friens over at mean have done an aggregation of oracles might be useful
326254,you can route ab bc a c through chainlink or default to univ3
326255,thank you very much very useful
326256,rari also has some oracle aggregation layer but limited to the tokens they manage
326257,not looking for a benefits analysis just to compare the tools dev experience eg languages evm solidity solana rust c c
326258,more on lockethere is no disadvantage to being the first participant in a streaming auction unsophisticated users who participate in the auction are guaranteed to receive an average outcomereceive a guaranteed allocationbecause streaming auctions have prorata distribution anyone who wants to participate will have a chance to do soq doesnt this mean with prorata distribution the whales will get most of the allocation for dumping later how is this fair excerpt from here
326259,whales can certainly get a large chunk of the supply but they arent paying any less per unit than anyone else is
326260,if you want sybil resistance and perperson fixed alloc amts you probably need smth more sophisticated
326261,additionally as the process is streamed you can exit at any point if you think the rate has become unreasonably highand unlike some other methods whales cant spoof high interest and then pull out last second for a better rate
326262,my point exactly
326263,we just deployed varenx on polygon with gasless crosschain swaps
326264,thats not too different from other distro mechanisms like lbp or batch auction tho
326265,most sales have the property that the more money you out in the more share of the tokens you get
326266,aside from dydx diversifi and idex does anyone else know of dexs using offchain clobs that settle onchain
326267,seems like a whale could just deposit a huge amount at once at opportune time to get one price it only moves up at each successive deposit in lockstep fashion
326268,what would be the opportune time its streamed so if they waited until the end theyd get very little
326269,
326272,
326273,how surprising
326274,wait it was not i have no context on either actually never heard of any of them blockchain ag maybe i have before
326275,why sir
326276,i dont fud especially since ones person reputation does not represent a whole project but people should just read audits and distribution more throughly
326277,ive been waiting the warpv2 for months now audit has been ongoing forever
326278,nan
326279,oh lol funny
326280,is trust wallet open sources how quick a trust wallet clone can be buildanyone can recommend best defi dev software house
326281,its not open source
326282,i dont get the sentiment whales bad theres always gonna be some whales one way or another you cant distribute tokens evenly obviously it should raise question at some point like in case of chia but when auction is freely available to anyone in the market thats pretty decent distribution
326283,yeah im tryna figure out what the contention is
326284,lol jeez he posted that
326285,
326286,if zach source no123nonono i am dissapointed in him

326290,eu wants to completely ban anonymous payments with crypto assetsarticle comments
326291,clickbait
326292,what is this eu
326293,why only 1 wallet inside metamask get imported when i import a metamask with 10 wallet in it to a new device
326294,click add new wallet
326295,just do create account
326296,no i mean i have 15 sub wallets in a metamask app i want to import all wallets in the app from 1 pc to another pc
326297,yup
326298,they are all there
326299,u jst need to add them
326300,a very large amount of wallets can be derived from your pk mm does not know how many you actually derived so it adds one
326301,but when i do this with importing seed phrase in another device t wont import all 15 wallets just one wallet
326302,nan
326303,ok so i need to import all those with its private key
326304,jst hit this and youll get more of ur wallets on the new metamask
326305,1 pk
326306,multiple hot wallets
326307,need to do it 15 times to import 15 wallets
326308,i dun rly know of a better way
326309,because aside of possible smart contract bugsexploits and this is unpredictable the main bridge its at least secured by main consensus pos checkpointing is needed to release the funds in the polygonethereum direction
326310,thanks
326311,how does it work like 1 seed phrase for app then private keys for wallets inside it any guide on it
326312,actually it does there was a recent discussion on privacy in mm and it turns out that when mm makes request to rpc to display balance it gets addresses of all accounts associated with seed phrase i cant find a link right now but if you want proof ill give it a look
326313,i think this would be a little more complex and no very much incentives to do it
326314,found it it was published by hopr
326315,it cant get all accounts associated with the keys you wont have enough ram it can only get accounts youve created
326318,well yeah i meant all wallets that you have created not all wallets that you could create bottom line is metamask knows all account that you have created under the certain pk
326319,
326320,worked thanks
326321,is there a way to delete wallets that are not in use
326322,altf4
326324,have any side chain projects minted total supply on ethereum and bridged all tokens to the sidechain for use in the project staking etc
326325,this made my day
326326,nan
326327,as a whale early on after withdrawals have brought the price down to what u r willing to pay put in a lump sum at once longer u stay in the pool the closer to average price u get also if u deposit early on you give max time for locked allocated tokens to linearly unlock which enable u to withdraw if price moves against youthis system favors whales as it enables them to put in a huge deposit in one go without paying more than a plankton who deposits a teeny amount
326328,
326329,
326330,
326331,my bags r so f rekt
326332,they are practically worthless
326333,some be like why did you sell 20 of your bag after 50x just have conviction bro is down to 0 glad i did
326334,even the stables ser
326335,convex 4 now kmp
326336,i cant live like this
326338,measured from what you paid for them
326339,they are not far away from there tbh still in but its tiny returns now compared to what was before
326340,i cant imagine how fked shit project safts are
326341,safts are lottery tickets we all know theyre just paper gains that dont count
326342,things got crazier this run with evaluations if you had 1 mil in vested tokens but the project is vaporware still with 8 bil fdv and low circ then you knew what was coming im sure
326343,
326344,brick and mortar banks will be competing with defi and offering loans for virtual real estatethe virtual real estate market will eventually start seeing services likecredit mortgages and rental agreements says jpmorganjpmorgan estimates metaverse economy will be worth 1 trillion while goldman sachs is forecasting 8 trillion
326345,yup with a long vesting schedule by the time your second half of tokens unlock they will be worthless meanwhile the team has already raised millions so their incentive for doing anything noteworthy is close to zero they have passed down all their risk to you thank you for buying into our dream
326346,i have a nomoonbag rule for myself its awesome
326347,oh nice projections
326348,hey bud enjoying the snow
326349,bitcoin shortterm holders are the most likely cohort to spend their coins in response to volatilitywith weakness across bitcoin markets we analyse sth behaviour from a number of angles including onchain activity supply dynamics and profitability
326350,this is all just storyline bullshit
326351,why isnt it just numbers from the blockchain
326352,the numbers and data is interpreted in the way they want
326353,how to mint l2 nfts portable to eth
326354,this cycle onchain data got a lot less accurate
326358,without an already established smart contract on eth l1 you just cant afaik
326361,dope i want one too
326364,remind me why 64 execution shard limit in the less defined phase 3 iirc got link to a vb post etc
326365,remind us why thatd be true even in a postrollup world why cant an eth contract verify that a rollup contained some tx or contract on l2 and then create one thats linked to it on l1 i guess moving back to l2 from the l1 would then create yet another contract is why but cant we just consider that the same nft whyisnt it similar to how we can have an nft start on eth and then go to 2 different l2s
326366,afaik a verifier just verifies that a certain state transition occurred according to the rules nothing more nothing less so that state must exist before the transitionso a state s1 after certain number of blocks changed to s2 l2 prover sends the new state and the proof to l1 the verifier then checks that the rules were not broken ie the transition is valid if nothing existed before hand obviously the transition cannot occur im not sure if it is possible to create a contract from an l2 state transition but then what is the point of creating the nft on l2 if you have to create the sc for the nft on l1 anywaysorry for a long explanation just think of eth l1 as a separate universe it does not know anything about the l2 from the pov of eth nothing exists outside of it
326367,ok right and does each mint of the collection need to first be done on eth or only some initial template
326368,i only have a general understanding but i think it may be possible to create a simple contract with an address id mapping and baseuri that can be populated later with data from elsewhere possibly some data from an l2
326369,howcould the l2 prover infra somehow support detailed inspection on demand i mean in some augmented version of the eth2 roadmap perhaps
326370,anyone knows why everyone is wearing jacketsparkas during their sessions at ethdenver lol
326371,not sure someone with a bigger brain possibly can theorize about that
326372,it was cold as fuck yesterday
326373,bit of an odd technical issue here thinking maybe the lobs have experienced similar i use mobile mm a lot and recently i think its been causing my mobile network data to crap out basically my phone data works as it should but when i try to use metamask the browser wont load a website then if i try and use my phone outside of mm no data will load i have to enter airplane mode then off again and data works as per has anyone come across this at all what would cause it
326374,i wasnt sure if its something more sinister like mobile networks blocking or throttling data to metamask but im sure its either a bug in my mm installationmm itself or just my phone dying
326375,lets please not comment this is small comments on twitter are excessive about it yes you might be right and i also agree but we dont have to make that debate again ctrlf for immunefi guys opinions bantegs discussion and more from back where numbers were discussed
326376,250k seems small
326378,nan
326379,interesting thread tho
326380,its not small by any standard if you think otherwise go bully google and every other company where a 50k bounty for critical is considered exceedingly generous
326381,people believe its small because they are used to bounties for critical smart contract bugs however thats not the same risk level coinbase could not be fully or even significantly drained by this like a defi platform could
326382,agree all kyced in the end
326383,twobitidiot retweeted __the ontario superior court of justice asked selfcustody wallet provider nunchuk_io to disclose user information and freeze users bitcointhis was the teams response
326384,a hacked coinbase account would have been enough to take advantage without risksthe bounty is not small but this level of market manipulation could have created proper havoc
326385,coin98 analytics twitterranking of active developer counts1 solana2 ethereum3 cardano4 polkadot5 cosmos6 terra7 avalanche 8 polygon9 fantom
326386,is this legit i thought eth had the upper hand by a lot
326387,are we sure metrics are legit
326388,no idea how they source it
326389,what is an active developer anyhow
326390,maybe a dev who runs on a treadmill or something
326391,solana has like 25 dapps on if but 4x the devs i thought rust made dev fast smell test alert
326392,rust is not fast at all actually the tradeoff between rust and go is optimisation and security against ease and speed
326393,it was mostly used as joke emphasis
326394,lol sorry
326395,developer
326396,doesnt look very accurate to me
326397,no worries interesting to remind on rust vs go analysis i thought the comparison to make is rust vs solidity tho i think people make too much fuss over language sometimes
326398,thats true wiser to choose libs based on their capabilities than on the language its written in its just easier to talk about the languages than the actual code
326399,what are your thoughts on gnolang victor the new sdk based sc platform being developed by jae kwon cosmos founder based on go lang
326402,sorry did not check it yet but will i am a vivid rustafarian but open to new things
326405,pls delete this until ivan is back
326406,look at the numbers its not ecosystem developers since that would be in the tens of thousands could be number of accounts that contribute to the main github repo for that chain and it makes sense that solana which is a relatively new chain and a lot of funding can pay a lot of devs to build it out
326407,hey guys anyone from token terminal here got some questions id like to ask
326411,risk is set to 1d in v1 based off of deribit and trades are executed every friday 6am est via telegram orders v2 is algorithmically found and sold via gnosis auctions re leverage yes opyn had partial collat options leverage and this liquidations but ribbon is fully collateralized so no risk of liquidation
326414,frens does anyone know if i can deposit weth to deribit insead of eth
326415,probably counting in the thousands of nft rug pulls on solana
326416,if theres any l or xl lobsters at eth denver pls stop by defi saver booth and grab yourself a tshirt sm sold out whatta heck are we not in burgerland today or tomorrow at the castleexcuse the shill ivan or anyone pls delete if this bad love you all
326417,anyone is having problems holding euro at binance giving me an error when trying to swap usdt to eur service not availablebased on our internal policy this service is not available for your account please exchange fiat currency for busd or select other payment methods to proceed
326418,as it should be nobody should get access to that not your mom brother girlfriend or president of russia
326419,its a ridiculous question to begin with its like asking louis vuitton or some leather wallet manufacturer to block some cash contained in their customers wallets
326420,is it possible to approve contract to spend your ethereum
326421,weth or
326422,you can just do that with erc20 representatives of eth weth steth and similar
326423,eth
326424,icic true
326425,nuh you cant unless you use wrapped ether
326426,tyty
326428,which charting tool tracks pairs on balancer
326429,slingshot
326432,
326436,i dont think its true as they dont really accept prs an annoyance ive found with solana is a lack of primitives if you want anything new the core team has to build the library spl would be really interested in their methodology
326437,ethereum or goethereum repo on github what is the methodology
326438,
326439,
326440,how does one revoke os
326441,
326442,how does one revoke open sea shows only tokens and no generic contracts
326443,i dont think you can revoke os lol this is pretty fucked
326444,go to erc 721 and you have to switch the toggle to contracts
326445,ah
326447,nan
326448,they are there for each nft is there a generic os contract to revoke
326449,1 by 1 each collection
326450,use debank
326451,very weird i definitly migrated to the new contract but the newest listing is from freb 16th
326452,any truth to this
326453,dont know revoke cash is stil down so
326454,etherscaniotokenapprovalchecker
326455,erc721 filter by contract
326456,yes did that las updateded contract 0216
326457,fml seems i gotta go spend some gas and revoke all my stuff
326458,thanks for the heads up though
326459,i think you need to do it only igf you migrated to the new os contract
326460,did that yesterday
326461,hurry up then
326462,as with all updates shoulda waited a bit
326463,great infratructure when you want to revoke and all the site are down lmao
326464,you can use debank
326465,debank also shows only tokens not contracts
326466,thanks for the tip i didnt know they have the nft contracts
326467,cant see erc721 contracts on debank
326468,or maybe you cant sorry
326469,looks bag holders pumping the token
326470,i cant figure out how this is x2y2 related
326471,is revokecash down
326472,yes
326473,for me yes used etherscan approvals
326474,can get through etherscan but slow
326475,
326476,etherscan just decided to go maintenance mode
326477,
326478,timely
326479,etherscan down as well
326480,this is a direct link to get to nft contracts
326481,instead of removing approvals just transfer the nft to a fresh wallet way easier to do and approvals are wipe clean on the new address
326482,is there an easy way to do that without having them to approve on open sea
326483,i used mev before but they dont even support batch transfers
326484,you dont need to approve in order to transfer unless you want to bulk transfer
326485,
326486,in case it helps as another option
326487,oof this looks big
326488,
326489,eithera do 1 by 1 transfers to a fresh walletb bulk wrap your nfts on nftx and then transfer to a fresh walletc idk if there a bulk transfer and idk how safe it would be to rush something like that
326490,
326491,
326493,
326494,they are all completely usless for nfts
326495,yeah etherscan seems to be the only one supporting erc721
326496,option b might not be useful if you have rare stuff because nftx charges like 10 for targeted withdrawals
326497,the worst part is that as etherscan is currently down slow af you cant even go to the contract to revoke access
326498,im spinning up a revoke cash instance on arcadias local domain should be up shortly
326499,try
326501,or transfer to new address without approvals
326502,
326503,
326505,
326506,so i can use chinese etherscan to revoke ser
326507,is this safe
326508,oh ya looks legit
326509,it looks legit
326510,you can check the call data on metamask to be sure should be approved false
326511,i use debank
326512,also revokecash that vpepo mentioned
326513,sadly revoke down
326514,use chinese etherscan
326515,
326516,anish deployed a new instance of revoke
326517,gg anish
326518,so its either chinese etherscan or that new site from anish
326519,maybe not exploit at all not confirmed though
326520,if anyone can put me in touch with people who were directly affected by this please do
326521,this will be the day that will scare normies towards nfts for quite some time moar fud for ze bear
326522,i received one of those emails today but ignored it entirely
326523,
326524,i got 2 emails they both looked legit but was suspect getting 2
326525,forcey01 can you dm me the two
326526,or forward them to me assuming no private info
326528,attacker just transfered 50 eth to doxed address probably psyops lol
326529,he refunded him lmao
326530,oh makes sense
326531,nan
326532,gave back 50 eth 1 of its bored apes
326533,ye im blind lmao
326534,why would he do that for just one person tho
326535,psyops
326536,he is giving back a ton of nfts
326537,naw so kind lmao
326538,haha
326539,damn
326540,wtf so weird if its phishing then bcz why would u go around sending emails just to return it
326541,not the ape just the dog
326542,he sold a lot of nfts already
326543,maybe he should refund marcus that guy got hard rekt
326544,maybe someone made him an offer he couldnt reject
326545,lmao yeah idk anything about bored ecosystem
326546,ive just read this in other chat so phishing is a perfectly plausible theoryi got this email and thought it might be phishing but verified url it was openseaio that was linked my nfts had approval set for the bad contract mentioned above
326547,super clear likely explanation
326548,was this or the email
326549,hi guys do you have an equivalent of revokecash the site isnt loading now
326550,
326552,thankyou
326553,
326554,you could also use debank
326555,was this finally
326556,pretty sure thats it attacker used valid signatures with zero eth prices to buy the stolen nftsso users had to sign them at some point contractlevel exploit wouldve seen far more damage
326557,btw has there actually been any one instance where opensea contracts were exploited cause i hear people cry every week about it and almost always wrong
326558,the issue with their old contract i mean they are migrating because of it
326561,not talking about this phishing attack
326562,which one then from the past
326563,suggests disconnecting mm to stay safe 2k likes and 13k retweets those nft zoomers literary have no idea what theyre doing
326564,
326565,cant steal from offline wallets smooort
326566,
326567,lol this yet again completely contradicts everything
326568,thanks syed_jafri ye that one was true indeed
326569,what a time to conduct hack
326570,everyone at ethdenver etherscan downslow
326571,the most confusing rug
326572,attack contract deployed 28 days ago the theoretical phish couldve happened any time since then or even longer ago
326573,nan
326574,account itself was tornadod 51 days ago
326575,etherscan down because everyone checking and revoking lol
326576,the trick with phishing is that you ideally dont notice being phished
326577,lol disconnecting
326578,sounds rude but you have to discount some iq on the avg bayc holder i dont make the rules
326579,yeah lol doubt that person that falls for phishing email realizes it
326580,disconnect metamask from a website and issue resolved
326581,wasnt this the same guy involved in some other hacked wallet thing or am i remembering the wrong person
326582,disconnect metamask cold wallet ser
326583,yup all attacks fail after this simple trick
326584,exploiters dont want you to know this
326585,i dont remember too
326586,definitely phishing or some type of mitm exploit to swap sign data all txs have valid signatures from users
326587,nft are sifu now
326588,
326589,
326590,ye seems like it
326591,just phishing again
326595,remember how uniswap made token lists to combat the listing of fake tokens what if metamask had a contract list or verified blue check contract deployer so that when you were signing something you could see if the deployer was off a list of verified addresses
326596,so like opensea could just register their deployer addresses with metamask and you would only sign things that came from those addresses
326597,yup something like google safe browsing for contracts is long overdue
326598,
326599,not sure if relevant
326600,wont save you from clueless user blindly signing any shit presented tho
326601,this is the only relevant tweet
326602,about how the attack worked
326603,metamask consensys should acquire etherscan theres a lot of ux improvement you could make if you owned both the interaction and the auditing of it i think
326604,god no
326605,yeah i know haha
326606,anyone find the origin of the phishing yet the only emails shared come from openseaio
326607,i would prefer the other way around ehterscan seems a lot more clearer to use than the increasing bloating of metamask
326608,we dont need etherscan to be destroyed as well
326609,seems to be the migrating email sent by os was replicated by the scammer to collect the sigs
326610,nitpick signatures dont come from addresses they come from ui entry points 99 of the time thats a website
326611,serious question why isnt revoke functionality standard ui for all wallets is there a technical reason for this having to use an external website feels to me like buying a car with no built in brakes
326612,mightve been the good old user clicks on search result ad phishing as well do dirty deeds and forward to real site when done of course the average user wont remember shit
326613,if it was an email i want to see what the phishing from address was
326614,it is insanely resilent considering the growth of use but lately i noticed captchas occasionally too many bots
326615,yeah it is i really appreciate etherscan just saying that because someone pointed out consensys should acquire it always have issues with metamask and their updates break stuff
326616,oh i def dont know all the technical details so when you sign a message you dont sign it for a specific contract it could be picked up by any contract depending on the message
326617,yeah signature frontrunning is possible when signature validation logic is done poorly
326618,the signature itself is can be thought of as just any arbitrary message originating from a public key
326619,its not keyed in to any specific endpoint unless thats part of what ur signing
326620,scammers activity if anyone wants to have a look weird behavior returning some nfts to owner and sending back eth to the exploited as well
326621,so the x2y2 theory is still on the table you sign a similarly opaque thing when bulk listing and nate happened to have done that apparently
326622,
326623,lol what
326624,eh ignore the opensea fault part
326625,oh interesting
326628,this is the first time we see a time delayed attack right
326629,
326630,badgers was time delayed too
326631,yeah
326632,badger too
326633,yeah this is strange
326634,i picked it up on marcus124eth
326635,marcus then immediately seemed to tx to a blank wallet
326636,nan
326637,
326638,is there a way to revoke the proxy contract that os looks and others need to activate a wallet or why is that even necessary
326639,nan
326640,so no one still knows what the phishing site url was something isnt adding up here
326641,for my fellow lobs this is everything i could dig up on the hackerphisher
326642,if anyone has any tools that could assist in mapping the 1st 2nd and 3rd order outgoing transactions from the 19 wallets hacker sent tiny funds to from 122 27 i have an etherscan api key but havent written the code for full network diagrams yet in the works
326643,dmed sir
326644,he is having a hard time admitting he got phished lol
326648,anon acc w 0 followers claim to undetstand tech no redacted
326649,read up the convo
326650,hmm but it was a thread close to a month ago close to the date the contract was created
326651,if its not allowed to talk about then i wont sry
326652,it is allowed but random wannabes proclaiming to know wo giving any info larps
326653,that just spams people who are affected scared researching
326654,but the thread was a month ago
326655,one month ago was this likely the account was larping around then wrathofend
326656,alright defi had crazier things happen just saying this wouldnt be that far fetched
326657,open sea historically havent refunded users for exploits directly connected to their systems right
326658,i thought they did one time
326659,think they only blacklistmark stolen nfts
326660,i think they refunded a few who got listing glitched
326661,if i remember correctly
326662,pretty sad tbh much less successful businesses in crypto have saved individuals due to their mistakes opensea seem to have near zero ethics too bad the competitors are shite
326663,im curious tho at what point is it acceptable to keep blacklisting or freeze assets in a decentralized ecosystem it makes sense if while we are still very centralized overall but for the most part major decisions especially with valuable assets the decision to blacklist or freeze to prevent further gain from an exploiter or hacker should be put to a vote no i understand were not in a perfect world and it most likely will be centralized for a while its clear that any decentralized system starts centralized and grows to become some utopian decentralized world but i think the question just boils down to what is decentralization in your the group eyes and how can we as a community and builders contribute further to this scenario
326664,they are a web2 company website in all meanings of that word
326665,others are not following these blacklisting bs patterns so its osspecific
326666,there is nothing to discuss defi projects shift from multisig to pure governor alpha nft people have nothing to transititon no protocols nothing works
326667,
326668,but this extends to more than just nfts
326669,exploits of protocols draining funds
326670,blacklisting on centralized marketplaces
326671,how is that related to the topic
326672,phishing attacks moving assets and being tracked down its very relevant no its the same idea policing of the blockchain by the entities who created it
326674,what is it in your eyes no this is a useless discussion its like hello kids do we like horses with horns yes right decentralize everything you can without losing much flexibility w deployments potential changes and keep decentralizing multisig governor alpha progressively
326675,2
326676,radial is a rug scam
326677,did they make an update
326678,no
326679,rug when your funds are stolen they are either delivering slow or not delivering but the funds are fine as is a useless engagement but an almost zerorisk one so is eh whatever
326680,what does governor alpha consist of
326681,google
326682,
326683,i wouldnt mix the emphasis from stolen money to slow and silent either is not the same thing i hope they read this and make an update
326684,sorry for being a bit mean you are just not saying something or i missed it what is it the point you are trying to make cause it sounds like a 60yo politician rn sorry 3 cryptd0e
326685,hahah
326686,i get it
326687,ive had a few beers so maybe its not coming across right
326688,entire nft space platforms aside are pics created by either a fiverr artist moneygrabs or by real artists but then the trajectory or anything w those nfts depends on that said artist being faithful and good you rely on 1 person instead of a protocol even its centralized ya although most collections are finished done art they larp activity to make people buy in expectation of something so ye then they are centralized on that team dao if there is any which is ok moreover they can usually change tokenuri and make penis pics on your collection as images instead however protocols displaying those pics allowing interaction must be decentralized cause they can be its just os is in burger land working like a web2 closed company of suited reptiles not web3 whatsoever total shitshow which is successful and will be successful because nft buyers or people in general even defi are morons which prefer credit card purchasers cause they are dumb so they prefer os web2 company approach and emails and authentication and calling the manager when something goes wrong lol and then they complain and yes we need alternatives and looksrare so far been fine blabla the usual old story its all meh
326689,so is it just a copy of the adoption of the law in the government i mean several stages with different departments and law can be canceled on any stage
326690,agreed i just think what i was trying to get at is its hard for people from the outside to view entities like os as web2 companies because theyre based on eth or other crypto and a decentralized marketplace i guess what im getting at is the decentralization word is being abused as a marketing tactic and its hard to reel in what is actually happening in this space
326691,organizations work like they do today irl because there must be a reason so yes it does not change organizational structure much but it opens it streamlines it and makes it transparent same people are still same though
326692,absolutely thanks now got it
326696,anyone interested id say disregard any political stances theres more to it but ties into the canadian issues rn great read also didnt realize it would pop up as main chat
326697,i dislike this generalization
326698,nonplatforms and nongenuine but that is the case for defi too was when liquidity was abundant now much less cause no people to rug so its same same as always
326699,do you think its possible to learn solidity on my own without any experience in programming before
326700,how long would it take to be decent at it learning fulltime
326701,definitely but i would highly recommend starting with some basic programming logic concepts before you jump in
326702,thanks i will look that up first
326703,
326704,a couple links to add on topicbasedbuilders useweb3xyz
326705,start with cs50 on youtube
326706,its a very good thread and reminder of what we all stand for
326707,
326708,very nice seems like its solved
326709,is that like a multiapprove one for all nfts possible is that specific to erc721 or cause i havent seen this in defi erc20s its always erc20 token specific sorry if i am asking nonsense samczsun oxmikko
326710,this comment wasnt really fairhere is tldr
326711,last 2 threads is all you need to know
326712,i mean you could do this already
326713,the difference in this attack was each user signed the same generic calldata
326714,there is no multi approve possible each approve has to be called on each erc721 contract individually this example is just already approvedlisted nfts for the opensea contract at least as far as i understand
326715,so the attacker didnt need to waste time figuring out which nfts you had at signtime
326716,oh me dumb true true thanks
326717,the victims essentially signed a order saying the attacker can do whatever they want with my user proxy
326718,and today the attacker used that to take all their nfts
326719,educationblogspracticenewslettersanalyzersfound this on the reaper discord server check it out if you have time
326720,ivan we really need you bearish nfts for all this to work this is the way
326721,i was never bullish fake jpeg stuff nonfake is totally fine is fun fk brands
326722,ok yes i am a hater always been
326723,let the hate flow through you ivan
326724,but also maybe we need a 10k pfp collection with subliminal propaganda teaching ppl how to manage they keys and not trust strangers
326725,i think its pretty fair there is some irony there with all the web3 chat mainly from people who dont quite get what web3 is in situations like this theyll shout from the rooftops about what web3 is web2 me vs web3 me what their definition of inclusivity in web3 and who should or shouldnt be canceled then they get done by click click clicking on some dodgy link contract etc and it becomes this is openseas fault or anyone else they can point the finger at past themselves and wen refund
326726,lmao well said yes
326727,that is true but also we all learning more about how wyvern contract works from scammers than opensea docs feels bad for anyone just learning about all this with os as their onramp they had no chance
326728,for sure no one really cares about the tech until it effects them though and regardless of pretty pictures this is a technical space its kinda the rub you wanna play the game this is all part of it ive always subscribed to the poker ethos of the lessons you learn in life are the ones that cost you the mosti guess perhaps this will help some people along the way with their learning experiencesif bayc has taught us anything though probs not
326729,after all the previous os exploit was people being too cheap to cancel listings for 300k assets and instead transferring them out to other wallets to avoid what a 50 gas charge
326730,i was looking at these the other day and didnt know where to start with them i am guess there is no info out there apart from the stuff on the wvyern site
326731,also why does open sea how to use the actual wyvern contracts and just not fork them
326732,there is an element of darwinism sure but these are crazily well funded product teams working in the space for half a decade no verified contract blind signing zero onboardingeducational content friken emails with big buttons to get ppl to migrate their assets that they dont bother telling you how works etc
326733,that i totally agree with also os isnt at fault but not exactly blameless either they could do much much better of course they wont i think we all know that by now
326734,
326735,posted in january 24th
326736,did they try and hide this by forcing the migration and gamble on nothing happening before it was finished
326737,meh same account is this true though only a handful of phished nfts are affected this is generalized to everyone unless you think this is technically correct suggest removing the tweet
326738,hey guys have you worked with pyth if yes can you send a code snippet thatd help me understand how to do the integration
326739,i think the issue was that os frontend wasnt showing any listings at all despite them being active
326740,pyth the solana oracle stuff
326741,their stuff like most solana projects isnt open sourced but they have pretty good developer libraries and documentation
326742,
326743,
326744,are there any good pinata alternatives
326745,we have been having huge trouble with them over the past few months
326746,i remember looking at temporal a while back and wasnt bad they were cheaper afaik
326747,proper breakdown of the os incident its insane how many people circulate false information with confidence on nft security related matters once more people who claim they did not get phished otherwise compromised are most likely mistaken
326748,
326749,
326751,
326752,good kill the dead horse
326753,
326754,rugpullers unite
326757,imagine they would have ever supported the backing price even d then people wouldnt want to ragequit and could simply selljust a big scam in the end
326759,nftstorage
326761,fleek
326762,im curious what trouble youve been having
326763,extremely garbage speeds from our dedicated pinata gateway crashing dash non working api for anything except listing pins etc allegedly it was only our account that was affected and the latter was fixed but problems keep cropping up
326764,cheers will check
326765,did you experience any ul limits
326767,their terms of service page says the free storage is limited to 31gib per file with a rate limit of 30 requestssec free storage lasts unless they decide to stop offering it you get 90 days service if they chose to push delete
326768,
326770,
326771,does anyone know a good guide for running a local rpc node trying to write my own rather than using hardhat
326774,love lobsters
326775,here is an article about our crew check it out and our github as well join lobsterdao for lobster nft collection discussions lets keep this chat clean and informative
326777,very cool ty will read it
326779,ok so do better
326780,there are some good stuff squeeth from the opyn guys is interesting and guillaume talked about perpetual options using univ3
326781,would love to offer a collaboration for easyfis metafi product with lobster group please advise on putting together the proposal paper ivangbi farm42
326782,haha you think railgun copied tornado they are completely different systems
326783,maybe you should actually watch that speech
326785,by the way welcome to lobsters chat telegram
326786,how are you settling in day 5 now
326787,railgun is a private address on layer 1 for smart contract interactiontornnova is a layer 2 mixer for sendstransfersno similarity
326789,well the first time i met witnet founders was back in 2017theyve been building for agesi dont think is too accurate saying they are a mere chainlink copy tbh
326790,why theres this pulsechaincometh tag on this address here
326791,does anyone know this is from the opensea hack
326794,this is a very awkward publicity stunt it looks bad on him
326796,thanks
326797,great so you are a tornado dev
326798,you could have just used your real name
326800,oh ok where did you hear about the incentives tokenomics
326801,because none of that was in the speech at all
326803,i give your fud a bbut only because you waited a few days after you created your account
326805,some people got in seed very evident
326806,just wanted to clarify a few things when comparing railgun and tornado nova1 merkle deposit proof with utxo model has been in literature long before tornado cash existed you could check zerocash paper for reference so it isnt as if tornado cash has pioneered it or receives credit for the joinsplit circuit design2 using bridges by tornado nova will never give the same security as relying on l1 there is an article by vitalik talking about all the issues with crosschains and bridges 3 unlike tornado nova railgun allows users to interact privately with defi smart contracts from within the railgun pool through adapters so it is a more mature protocol than just a private transfer4 railgun has the ability to whitelist vet erc20 if needed by a governance proposal so it isnt a limitation5 the tech of railgun is still evolving to support nft private transfer private vesting proofs of disclosure sealedbid auctions some of these features are already in audit so railgun isnt a copypaste of tornado novaim open to discussingelaborating more on an honest comparison
326807,the way youre dealing with this guy is not a good look he appears to be knowledgeable you appear to hide and lash out with the age of his account cringe
326808,this is a much better look
326809,anyone from binance here that could give me a hand please
326810,yeah sure whats up
326811,are you trying to get phished
326812,yea i thought the same
326813,not really just need someone lol
326818,for merkle proofstornado on oct 17 2021 railgun on jul 9 2021 so which one is olderregardless merkle proof verification is a pretty standard thing like if i ask you to write power function using forloops the implementation will be almost the same im not going to argue that merkle proof circuit is pioneered by any i just wanted to point out that railgun code for merkle proof was there before tornado so it isnt copypastethe second image you compare two different things commitments vs nullifiers if you check the code the commitments and nullifiers are computed differently and they arent mere variable changes
326819,and maci had circom code for it over two years ago im pretty sure
326820,also i cant find the similarities in the smart contracts please share which parts you think are copypaste
326821,as i said merkle proof verification is a standard thing and you can find a lot of similarities in that part between different projects
326823,i looked at maci merkle tree when i was developing the circuits for railgun it is a good repository with helpful stuff but still this doesnt show any copypaste code
326824,you linked rg repo link
326826,also the tone is as accusation here that you had months to take it from there i thought we are having a healthy discussion it is all going around a standard merkle proof verification but ignoring the entire code for circuits and contracts
326828,no worries just wondering how is a copypaste from the former uses switchers while the latter uses mimc dualmux selectors so even the old tornado code is different also im wondering about the similarities in the contracts code because i cant find them
326831,i didnt shift the tone i was replying to the comment that railgun copied tornado code so i pointed out the difference im not accusing or being aggressive to any other project i learned from many opensource projects including tornado cash and i share the respect to all of them but at the same time im showing that railgun is not a copypaste tech with evidences
326833,i havent lied i was comparing tornadonova code to railgun code you said everything is copypaste including contracts but you are fixating on merkle proof which has different implementation even from the old tornado in 2020 my point is lets stay on the healthy discussion for the benefit of all and compare tech without accusing copypaste or scam or providing nothing new
326834,could you share opensource your code repository audit reports so i can learn the tech by buccaneer v3 and compare with railgun without those i dont know what to talk about
326835,i am not related to that product just wanted to share some relevant info
326836,
326837,im a tech guy and also a cryptographer so i can understand cryptographic protocols code or some technical stuff also if you have heard of dcg they have recently invested in railgun i wonder if such a large top fund would invest in a scam and damage their reputation or dont they have cryptographers or some analysts to advise on which project to invest in
326838,sortof ontopic i was originally intrigued by railgun bc of the ability to run defi apps privatelyare there dapps today j can use anonymously via railgun eg aave
326839,there is a generic adapter contract written here to support calling other smart contract functions like aave but of course a custom one for aave will be better
326841,is there any platform looks like1 manager opens vault with their strategies on perp2 investors add their funds to the vault3 once get profit from trading share revenue
326843,i hope both of your coins pump have a nice day
326844,this redacted last 2 comments fin
326850,
326851,ngl this update kinda laughable
326852,very good onchain sleuthing os
326853,
326854,surprisingly honest take
326855,do things that you think are funny or awesome even if people tell you it wont workcan we now add the slots machine to gear
326856,tbh our production has been far from structured lol mikael goes onto the coding sprees and comes back with magic which i wasnt too happy at first muh processes for pm must be followed but then people loved it so after 2 times like this we just let him go rumble speaking of which he just finished v2 to give into an audit freeze and idk whats in the v2 even
326857,come to ethdubai
326858,anybody has an idea with it
326859,is there a tg chat for attendees
326860,
326861,will be speaking there as well as our og wellknown lobster admins starring mr andre cronje twittercomethdubaiconfstatus1493850425841180672
326862,is andre actually speaking tho
326863,will come fanboy for your talk cia
326864,our dear lead researcher sasha will also be there speaking but patrick just ignores my messages
326865,seems like i need go back to dubai
326867,pollenid i think
326868,thanks
326869,live on both eth and matic if i am not wrong
326870,pretty sure dhedge is more like social follow trading permissionless hedge funds rather than pooling capital in permissionless programmatic strategy vaults
326871,yeah misinterpreted the question my bad
326872,but dhedge doesnt support perp
326873,no worries
326874,only synthetic assets synthetix unless it has changed since i used it havent been following
326875,babylonfinance
326876,man of culture
326877,super thanks
326878,also doesnt have perp
326879,actually very nice inbound from daily ape hr recommend fuck darrenlautf for building competitive media spaces but it is useful maybe we sell lobsters to him xx
326880,hi guys if you use the same nonce when signing a tx on rinkby and mainet ethereum can someone calculate your wallets private key
326881,can someone calculate your wallets private keyno whatever you sign wherever this simply cant be done
326882,no but they can potentially replay it on another evm chain if it doesnt have replay protection enabled on the rpc you connect with
326883,no route from public key to private key even with signature and nonce
326884,mm ok i thought i had read somewhere that if you sign two txs with the same nonce from one wallet they can calculate it from the ecds equation ill try refind the article
326885,when youre signing a transaction the data includes chains id so signing the very same transaction on ethereum and rinkeby actually means youre signing a different set of data
326887,i think any managerstrategist could propose using perps as part of hisher respective strategy babylon themselves doesnt offer any strategy really
326888,i see will take a look deeply
326889,
326890,the dhh redemption arc off to a great start
326891,anyone know why gas on fantom is 910k rnn 34 top gas guzzler contracts are all unverified
326892,
326893,hey lobsters i have a question about dev toolsmulticoin capital has 3 recent projects in the field of p2p web3 computationsstorage1 arweave permanent storage2 ceramic data composability network3 fluence tools for p2p applications backendlessthey are all backendless but how to use them in the web3 dapp dev imagine p2p twitter or group chat caseany tutorial articles about which is perfect foradvices like find on the website doesnt work since they have can use it for all content or almost no useful docs in case of arweavethanks waGbi
326894,stubborn man with really strong opinions surprised he was wrong
326895,hey people me again i need a bit of help does anybody know of a working goerli eth faucet or if anybody has some can you kindly send me to 0xa7d380518e98e302b6cb6b571e6169bff5b8b938thanks a bunch
326899,guys about opensea phishing case did i get it right that hacker created a fake opensea website so victims sign the transaction there couldnt follow this discussion before so would appreciate if someone can confirm whether its right
326902,the bad signature could have been everywhere
326904,
326906,so it was just email phishing with malicious transaction approval
326907,could have been on any other website compromised xss or with malicious intent
326908,or a malicious google ad for opensea looksrare x2y2
326909,same phone number for all kucoin phone number requests phone number changes and is named when pressing withdrawam i compromised fellas
326910,gotcha thanks
326915,hi folks we just released a backtesterinitiator for uniswap v3 positions which i hope you find interestinguserful
326916,we wrote a bit about it here
326918,
326919,metis txs stuck and cant clear them need to put lower nonce w any tx w higher gas tried didnt work
326920,same nonce higher gas
326921,has anyone came across some good thread or a list of hackathon projects winners presented at eth denver
326922,i was a judge of the hackathoni liked one called fracture
326923,this is a good thread about notable projects
326924,i want to learn solidity but i have absolutely no skills in any programming languagei dont even have my high school diploma and i know it wont be easy for me to learn but can you recommend me a start
326925,new dev solidity questionsjust check a few links
326927,tbh you can just ask them to add strategies they did it for us in a week great team to work with
326928,thats cool
326929,wait a sec insights of a retard moment is having a makerdao vault open at all times is a must for eth holder price down and u r liquidated sure u suffer the liq fee but eth is down while you sold it higher so you can rebuy and have same eth size position price up u win print more brrint rate is 0 so can be disregardedwhat did i miss
326930,nothing except you lose 13 on liquidation
326931,ivan onto another pleb bear quest
326932,ivan opens up a wonderful defi world
326933,nan
326934,ivan discovering maker in 2022
326935,ok so why are you all still poor then
326936,i want to send a pepe sticker
326937,even lobsters cant only the great leader can
326938,may i ask sth via dm
326939,what if you get liquidated at the very bottom and the price immediately bounce 1030 total loss with liq fee can be up to 50 in the extreme case
326940,dont forget your defisaver for automation
326941,
326942,then you should nekk urself w such luck
326943,yeah long squeeze risks
326944,holding is better if loan to value ratio is high and volatility is high too
326945,you say your trading got better chad
326946,makers super power is the 1 hour delay osm you might lose sleep but aint getting liquidated that easily
326947,i personally really like their liquidation model it feels like it is very human oriented in the sense that wicks wont get you rekt
326948,id say its brrrrrr but that also works
326949,agree oxmikko need v3 ser
326950,its famous alexpgc21 online welcome
326951,you dont need v3 you just need keeper bots
326952,if you use instadapp you can even trade with leverage similar to gearbox
326953,nah reliance on keeper bots heavily contributed to black thursday damages new liq model is much more human participant friendly
326954,its super easy to build a bot which will check your positions and provide additional collateral if needed or swap assets back
326955,ye aware but i am not trying to max out gains more so utilize them efficiently that is to make sure my eth is not idle
326956,why doesnt nikolajankovic integrate
326957,ser explain
326958,can you tell more about
326959,ppl were comfy thinking keeper bots alone would be enough things got very ugly and turned out king had no clothes since then liquidations 20 was designed allowing for easier participation from the unsophisticated
326960,something something when things go bad all you have is your preparation lesson learned was that bots solve that was not the correct preparation
326961,which protocol are you talking about here
326962,defisaver
326963,maker
326964,and keeper bots were what gelato
326965,or keeperv1 similar
326966,this was march 2020 before all that keepers were whale users institutions vcs tech sophisticated users etc
326967,they were makers keepers
326968,it was back when it all did not exist
326969,yes yes
326970,maker liquidation system is that thing ppl dont do much about until market shakes and then everyone agrees more preparations was needed then ppl forget again a few weeks later until the next major liquidation is about to send eth to 0 in less than 1 hour
326971,wdym we do
326972,but currently only in the form of partial unwinding more options finally set to gradually roll out first being one that uses dai deposited into yield earning protocols yearn rari mstable to pay back debt and keep the position above the water
326973,blz integrate w gearbox now ser
326974,ahhh that yes i mean you did say youd reach out a bunch of times but never did
326975,lets talk once we get back from burgerland
326976,you guys have any info on this its in 20h
326977,probably zksync2 hardly any chances of launching a token at this stage coz that would only benefit airdrop hunters
326978,99 sure its the release of their public testnet
326979,did you read the conditions needed to perform the exploit
326980,if at any point before the conclusion of the attack the polygon security team takes actionwait is this a thing
326981,hi there are not that dramatic capital requirements this is just a tradeoff between the time it takes to fully decrease the total staking power you can put 100k and it would take a few days and you can put 20m and it would take a few hours resulting in stealing billions also there is no risk at all to that capital you can withdraw it any time even with a reward possibly
326982,peples
326983,have you tried this
326984,this fud is unfair to both polygon and us the reality is that the vulnerability is nearly impossible to exploit as there are layers of complexity that make it easy to block the attack lets explore them though all of them are in the bugfix review already the attack is not currently possible because there is no open validator when a validator opens up there will be a fierce flashbots auction this auction needs to be won on every iteration of the attack and the attack must be iterated the attack fails if any auction is lost which it will be if the polygon community notices the attacker wont get their eth back if the attack fails its extremely costly to attempt the attack the attacker also needs large amounts of delegated matic theres currently 4b total of matic staked 5b at the time of the report to attempt the attack the attacker needs 16b of matic for a 2checkpoint more than 5 hours attack which is the minimum amount of time completely unfeasible as theres only 55m of matic available in dexes across ethereum and polygon a more modest 10m of matic takes 398 checkpoints more than 47 days even 100m of matic takes more than 4 days if at any point before the conclusion of the attack the polygon security team takes action be it the minimum 5 hours with 16b of matic or the 47 days with 10m of matic the attack completely failsgiven the significant nonrecoverable eth for flashbots unrealistically large matic requirements and the overwhelming probability of a successful whitehat counterresponse the report was downgraded from critical to high by the polygon team because it was not feasible to exploit in practice we reviewed this case with them in detail to validate that judgment and concluded it was fair and reasonable we always require a detailed explanation and reasoning why severity needs to be downgraded as our imperative is to ensure whitehats are treated fairly none of that is to say it wasnt an excellent report the vulnerability is very creative the report is well written and the whitehat is an exceptional goodfaith actorso this fud from eylon across multiple chats is it ignorance of the impossibility of exploitation or is it disingenuous i couldnt help but notice that eylon is invested in our competitor
326985,brilliant copy pasting from another channel
326986,once noticed theres many different ways to block the attack its not hard
326987,as i said therethere is one question thats present here between your spamming fud and ad hominem do you think the white hat here recieved an adquate compensation
326988,unfotunately i cant repond to all the points youve raised right now but you are grossly misrepresenting the amounts and calculations in the favor of making this seem much more complex
326989,i read the blockchain state and did the math myself perhaps you could point out what i got wrong and what the right numbers are instead of spouting more fud
326990,dont throw devs under the bus it takes a high level of understanding of these complex systems to be able to find these issues the sum offered can make devs reconsider in the future and the ecosystem as a whole suffers
326991,anyways this is not the forum for this debate
326993,it was a fair comment tho
326994,posting backyou attacked peoples reputations failure disgraceful quite unfairly i dont know why you chose to do that but typically the best way to handle this type of situation is to make things transparent and share the truth and let people decide for themselvestruth fears no examination
326995,but ye blz bring math if u wanna argue the article seemed detail point to details then but better write ur own piece cause dissecting it in here would be a 1000 msg convo
326997,agreed
326998,wtf
326999,the whole copy paste massive list of arguments is def not a good way to have a conversation
327000,what the fuck
327001,even more fucked up
327002,this aint no npm supply chain shit
327003,this is like nationstate level threat actor
327004,no sense in making fud for sure but i feel white hats should be evenly compensated else such peanut bounty will only tempt good white hats to rather attack instead of helping the projects even coinbase recently gave like just 150k for a market nuking bug not fair tbh
327005,if your bitching about safe harbour payouts go sell your zero day somewhere
327006,plenty of buyers if its juicy
327007,similar to
327010,
327011,quite an old attack
327013,dated 2014 wwwsecureworkscomresearchbgphijackingforcryptocurrencyprofit
327014,this is recent
327015,we have seen domain hijacking b4 wrt cream attack last year
327016,great read on topic
327017,very well heres the mathheres the polygon staking contract it has 4b in matic staked which means that a singleiteration attack to get the total stake down so that a single validator has 23 takes 16b4b x 066 x solve for x the checkpoint interval is 5120 blocks each of 2 seconds see checkpointblockinterval that makes the checkpoint time 2 hours and 50 minutesyou can even see an announcement here if you want to get the number of checkpoints for an arbitrary stake y you just solve4b x y 066 yfor xthis gives 398 checkpoints for 10m and 38 checkpoints for 100m i trust you can take the math from therei dunno about you but i dont feel confident in my ability to hide my nefarious dealings on the blockchain for 9 whole days
327018,2 more researches to add on topic
327019,
327020,sorry to disturb all the pro level info here i recently launched a coin put it on an exchange and got rugpulled by someone else because the liquidity i put in was too little obviously this is a very n00b mistake what are some communitiesforums out there where i can learn to avoid such noob mistakes in the future
327022,dont trust these tools but using them can reduce risks a bitrugchecker tools
327023,yeah thanks unfortunately empty
327024,
327025,thats not twitter kind ser
327026,take number 2there is no point in doing so because if eth up i am already up if eth down i am down anyway so its a short essentiallyas i always thought just dumb today
327027,david capable of changing his mind
327028,
327029,the disclosure was made before that annoucement i would assume the annoucment of increasing the checkpoint is precisely because of that disclosure i actually didnt realize until you posted it but you are making the calculations from after the bug fixthis is actually a lot more outragous than the original issue that could be attributed to negligence or the nature of your business model and imo this is far worse to your and immunefis credibilitynow im trying to figure out where the 5h checkpoint came from
327030,also nice that you are updating the post morten with this false information
327031,please check the year on that announcement
327032,the calculations from before the bug fix are actually _even worse_
327033,these tools are meant for investors checking to see if a token is a rugpull im saying as a token launcher myself what attack vectors should i be aware of where can one get educated
327034,nailed it with lack of imagination its always either that or i dont like capitalism
327036,ah youre actually correct
327037,its twitter without the weirdness theyre introducing these days
327038,thanks ser bdw i also found this somewhere
327039,see this great researches also check out see this list of best tg chats list of all smart contract sec tools go through these mentioned links nft security compilation
327040,much obliged
327042,for this part still only applies to maturity timestamp
327043,rush_pat i understand that everyone is interested but lets please refrain from discussing the war here no doubt that any war is evil and especially this one this chat room is one of the few places where you can take your mind off the disturbing news and i would like to keep it that way lets keep this chat informative and techfocused thank you for understanding
327049,i want to learn more about degen score like whats maximum and minimum possible scores how it works is there any documentation or code open source
327050,minimum is zero current top1 is 1700 i havent seen and source code however you can chekc bankless newsletter for general idea on how to raise your score
327051,docsgooglecomspreadsheetsd18lrhwvndm7wsyce3tfrgfqxnhgodclah8errkljcsgeditgid0 graphorgfile0e8bc2cdce6c4bf591663jpgplease do not lynch me for this but i just osinted some stuff
327052,i wish there was some score for using furucombo i believe its worth a mention
327053,can you do something with your degenscore
327054,you can increase it by using popular dapps or be whitelisted by some protocols
327055,for what
327056,oh to be whitelisted
327057,
327058,an important thing to remember with flashbots is that it only covers major defi bluechip mev the total amount skimmed is far far higher
327059,hey lobsters interested in defi option vaults weve backtested complex option strategies one appeared profitable long call short two calls cover first sold call with the spot and the second one with bought callhope to see more liquidity on option amms in the near future to integrate them in complex option strategies vault needs an amm to buy an option
327060,what abt cost
327061,cost of what
327062,in that strategy cost of 1 long call roughly equals two shrted calls but that depends on the market
327063,position pnl on the right here
327064,ah yeh thats not how you price options
327065,yeah we build vaults and outsource amm part
327066,to who
327067,working on adapters for the lyra protocol
327069,they have limited strikes right
327070,yes so double short call strategy should choose strike that is nearest to the spot price at trade time
327072,sometimes and it particular on fantom some protocols seems to take ages to load and sometimes dont load at all any idea whats the reason
327073,any updates on nansen partnership
327074,please join lobsterdao for dao qs this main chat should stay techfocused active work on collab is underway follow our and nansens twitter accounts so you will not miss anything there will be news soon and you will all hear them for sure also check out if havent already twittercom10b57e6da0status1488831263616159744s20tt88hkpo_aq0cqsjmkot7vg
327076,i have a few questions that others might have as well if you believe it is not pertinent to this chat feel free to delete or let me know i am 2 months away from graduating with a cs degree and i already know solidity and i have been in crypto for about 2 years i have been in touch with some teams and it turns out that i underestimate my skills however i am not ignorant about the high level of expertise that other people have and i know how far i am from reaching a similar level given that academic research in topics related to crypto seems like something that no university can offer at least from my current perspective i might be ignorant of some details would you recommend joining a team and grow organically from there or would you spend however long it takes even if it is 2 years or more to learn and research as much as possible in the shadows without committing to any actual projectin other words i am not afraid of lack of learning resources bc there is excessive information out there but i feel that somehow anyone who wants to make an impact needs like a mentor in order to bootstrap a successful career in crypto it is not only that there is no formal education path but also the lack of internships and often rejection simply based on experience age can be discouraging at times and many developers just want to jump ahead into web3 and get a job instead of looking for a true mentorship and learning experience which i believe is the correct path for getting started dgaf about salary and focus on learning
327077,id join the team to gain reallife experience
327078,that part i get it but for example what if the team delegates on you a complicated defi implementation that is prone to mistakes and you do not really trust your own skills
327079,id paragraph my wall of text first
327080,isnt there like an inherent time pressure on the developer to solve something that even if delivered could lead to undesirable consequences
327081,in the end it is something similar to what andre comments on his articles but this time it would be like the responsability lies in the back of a junior dev in the middle of his career
327082,most of the time in my experience is not about the individual but about the teamif the team delegates to you a task above your head thats a team decision failing either because you didnt raise your hand on time to let them know or maybe someone misjudged your skillseither way its the teams fault and most likely if catch on time someone able will pick that up
327083,i agree with that
327084,trust your skills and trust your ignorance awareness also trust in your teams skill and trust in them being human and able to be wrong that should always be on scope
327085,its not as though youre put in to a position of being the only one looking at your code on such largeimportant tasks outside of that its up to you to know what you know but also to know what you dont know and to communicate it the worst possible thing you can do is bottle it in because if you cant get it done but failed to tell people you could set the team back when any of them could have happily helped you out or made other arrangements dont worry
327086,also there are so many cool projects around now that theres def a comfy spot somewhere where theyd be stoked to have someone with your skills i think theres a great chance you can find something that really suits you starting out and isnt too overwhelming where you can grow and learn all the while
327087,does anyone remember the site where you can see mker dao cdp positions and their liquidations
327088,whats happening on polygon
327089,not much the usuals
327090,block reorgs are a common problem in polygon which is why we ended up moving to gnosis chain apparently theres a v3 version coming soon that should have instant finality
327091,a good thread for context
327092,thx
327093,
327095,you can see auctions here
327096,you can bid on auctions here
327097,sometimes last year you could buy up dai for a 20 discount good times
327099,shade network has just opened claim for shd airdrop seems nodes are holding up ok on shade network processing claim transactions viewing key transactions are congested a bit though secret network mega congested where trading of shade is active on sienna swap shade have seeded a pool there the congestion has meant they have been unable to seed the secret swap pool about 10 of nodes on secret are offline due to the volume of transactions gasa fees and block processing time have increased significantly there
327100,still looking for goerli faucet if anyone knows a working one thanks a lot
327101,keep an eye on the paradigm faucet they usually dont take long to refill it
327104,
327105,lmao tenx cofounder
327106,lowkey buried the lede tho how good is chainalysis software
327107,chainalysis demixed the wasabi transactions and tracked their output to four exchanges
327108,fucking tenx hahaha
327109,these days mimo
327110,what a scam
327111,nan
327112,guys do u know how can i get data about how many lobsters bought at coinlist nym and gal
327113,pamp it
327114,well at the end he got away with etc instead of ethby no logic they should have been used 11b in the article title
327115,thats internal system stuff nobody can gi u this except coinlist
327116,even if we count stolen eth at the moment of hack its around 50m or so
327117,almost as if they wanted a headline
327119,got halfway through the article and that threw me off the whole story nobody knew that was possible til now
327120,want to start with frontend dev would you recommend react or vue
327121,a bit of comedy in these trying times
327122,start with react then explore others
327123,are you looking for fe dev
327124,for copypasting vuefor solid apps react
327125,lefterisjp gm d
327126,thx thought so finally want to do projects full stack
327127,thanks i am tracking it but if you know any other faucet kindly let me know or if you can send some i would be grateful
327128,hi folks did anyone come across a decent lawyer with a handson experience in uk crypto regulationalthough im mostly into all things raves nfts and ai music in parallel were building a cryptobacked loans solutionas we build it up we are looking for someone experienced enough to help us navigate through all regulatory questions applications it might also include fca regulation of fiat products in the futureany recommendations introductions would be amazing
327129,uk and loans w no kyc sounds bad anyway i would assume michaelrosmer could know of such
327130,happy to recommend a couple of ppl ivangbi you could do loans without kyc esp if overcollateralised
327131,you can also try posting here youre lookup
327132,anyone here has experience with opensea factory contractsim running into a lot of problems starting to suspect their docs are outdated
327133,oh shit my dms are xploding lol
327134,dont even think you can run a full node
327135,hey guys with the zksync announcement going live today do you think were getting closer to prediction platforms on eth pancakeswap prediction game is one of the most sucessful smartcontracts in bsc if not the most i really wish we could see something of the sort in eth
327136,is there a salary payment dapp that distributes pay to wallets i vaguely recall yearn or one of andres teams being paid that way
327137,which announcement
327138,supposedly something is being announced in 7 minutes
327139,
327140,alleged launch of the public testnet of zksync 20
327141,or an announcement of it
327142,there it is
327145,afaik its not a dapp but may fit your purposes maybe
327147,194 block deep reorg on polygon pos chain
327148,maybe cordinape or requestfinance
327151,didnt get this did they reorg their chain officially to save themselves from some exploit or something
327152,coordinape is not automatic afaik they payments are still done manually
327153,mb sablier
327154,shat a fucking joke platforms cant run properly on polygon with this shitshow
327156,farm42 something to add to your collection
327157,thank you read it it should be at airgapcomputercom already
327158,if im not mistaken thats why cool selfmade crypto hardware wallets have such big capacitors it will make this attack very hard to perform and all in epoxy of course
327159,theres no reason to assume that these attacks exist in the wild and executing one would require planting malware on the target machines making it quite difficult though not impossible from the article anyway i will add it to the opsec repository separately much thanks
327160,is there any app supporting it already beside bridging and transfers
327161,there is on solana
327162,not that i know of happy to be corrected tho
327163,interacting with zksync portal 20 is all an ordinary degen can do for now
327164,i was reviewing past discussions about this topic some user accuses a lack of communication between the primary validators and the backup in bor in some way when the backup validator starts producing blocks because a primary validator isnt producing propagate these to the network but then the primary returns from its delay and manages to reject the backup blocks and put its own back the network is notwell synchronized globally and these things happen i think however there is still no more wellestablished or official research article
327165,get this error now all the time for simple send also in mm can you set gas price now i only see setting maxpriority fees now
327166,didnt makerdao did something like that i remember conti mentioning something in a podcast
327167,superfluid can be used for that i think although not sure what is their state since the recent hack
327168,it seems to be a pretty mature product anyone can vouch for it
327169,thanks for the salary app responses definitely helps to narrow down with which one to use
327170,a few months ago this was posted for salary invoicing dapps
327171,tried it not a fan of it invoices dont have correct information required for local authorities and couldnt directly transfer from an exchange
327172,ivangbi please check dm rg a proposal for the lobster dao working group
327173,mute seems to be live on testnet
327174,lol need research but headline sounds like put all your eggs in 1 basket
327175,maybe
327176,any ideas to fix this i tried using very high gwei on matic to clear some stuck prior tx using the same nonce but it always gives the above error trying a simple send
327177,is that an error or a warning looks like you can very much still hit save
327178,isnt that gas limit assuming a bit more than a simple send
327179,i get this eror after save and confirm
327180,yes increased it just in case also tried with 21000 normal
327181,hello everyone quick warning for anyone that ever interacted with dsd maybe someone can help decipher this too a wallet funded a few days ago has been buying up tokens to quorum and has intiated an onchain voteedit the proposal was to add the wallet as a minterthis contract pool would have been approved for usdc if you ever provided liquidity
327182,so you sent yourself 0 matic using a custom nonce for the earliest stuck tx
327183,based this went hard makes me realise i should probably rotate wallets for reasons like this
327184,ethereum is the futureguess this is the periodic reminder to use revokecash and remove all un needed approvals
327185,yes but also tried sending another account 0 same error
327186,this or rotate wallets
327187,you may be able to do ctrl shift j to see what the actual error is at least on windows
327188,no longer sure theres anything stuck from before because i reset the history in mm where can i see whats being processed for the nonceaddress
327189,im on mac
327190,i never reset my history in this situation not sure what it implys
327191,implies
327192,is there anything happening on chain
327193,pending nonce
327194,afaik they dont just disappear lol
327195,they were never on polyscan i guess cuz they never started processing nothing is stuck on polyscan
327196,should i send to the same address or another
327197,id love to blame it on polygon because 50c soon but my only input is resetting metamask lol which i hate to do personally
327198,its interesting that these types of exploits can never happen when tokens are native assets and not funky erc workaround contracts wallet rotationapproval revoking just isnt a concern
327199,tried resetting
327200,what happened to chomsky
327201,like you reinstalled it and still having the issue
327202,macos the professionals os
327203,
327204,the real one or de_fi group og
327205,nothing in console but heres the expanded mm tx failure
327206,pretty clear there nonce too low
327207,looks like you have a pending tx or something
327208,ya when expanded found it too and now works but without custom nonce not sure why it didnt work before
327209,well now its pending again
327210,finally cleared
327211,anyone from dextools in here will solidly be added at some point
327212,its not an error just advise if you send it it would still go through
327213,in a meantime solidly trading data is already available at dexguru
327214,thanks
327215,
327216,they also dont happen with newer erc contracts something that cant happen if you encode too many assumptions into your blockchain
327217,dont think its a question of assumptions you makeethereum was created without a concept of tokens eth is different from wethwbtcif every token was handled by the ledger as an asset equal to eth in all behavior a lot of stuff would likely be much betterbut obviously these issues and the usecases werent conceptualized back then so its not surprising its not optimized around this
327218,actually eth is worse than erc20s
327219,thats why weth exists
327220,the thing is that approvals arent even possible with eth you have to explicitly send an amount and then you get back the change this is clearly worse design than just saying how much you can take and then if they dont use all of it you can revoke after the fact the problem here is erc20 requires separate txns for approving and revoking which isnt super great when you are paying 5 for such a tx
327221,we came up with ways to permit for a particular txn already but its too late for a bunch of erc20s and everyone keeps deploying basic bitch tokens instead of ones which support good features dai supports the good features for example
327222,you can swap dai on uniswap without explicit approvals and without infinite trust
327223,hello there is a way to analyze tornado cash withdrawals
327224,life finds a way
327225,
327226,im aware as i said its not designed around the concept of assets and their interaction with smart contracts so there are patches to try and fix this but its still a mine field both users and devs need to traverse
327227,aye guyscould someone give me a hand im stuck with signing messages through metamask
327228,re are there examples of other chains where tokens are native assets and play well with the approvalpermit pattern cardanohow else do they handle programmably manipulating your assets
327230,whoever responded to my message ive verified the contract
327231,cardano for one yestheres othersbasically you dont need to permit since theres no reason for anyone to access your tokens without your consentpart of interacting with the contract is sending it the tokens
327232,some chains have notification handlers on receiving tokensaka simply transferring to a contract will trigger an action on the contract
327233,
327234,lobs perks or bust
327235,ivan perks u work for free
327236,but ye alessandrotc lobster perks or fud
327237,1 lobster sum karma
327238,gotcha are there still ways to pull tokens if they are native assets without being initiated from the owner
327239,
327240,
327241,is there more info on lfg usage locking of btc they fundraised
327242,from theblocks article the reserve has been introduced however to step in if selloffs in crypto markets erode those incentives the reserve assets can be utilized in instances where protracted market selloffs deter buyers from restoring the ust pegs parity and deteriorate the terra protocols open market arbitrage incentives said lfg
327244,does anyone know why axie only publishes prebult binaries and not the git repo for its ronin chain looking at the config parameters its obviously a geth fork seem strange
327245,its par for the course for sky mavis they got literally 5 in a review we did on their katana dex transparency is not their strong suit
327246,must have been an easy review
327247,yeah i was astonished while i was writing it makes it fast at least they never responded to my emails to improve the score
327248,what do i gain tangibly from a better score is it tangibly worth more than what i lose are the questions
327249,no one cares about their defisafety score until they get hacked
327250,at least bsc open sources their implementation
327251,well it is a copy of a copy so the bar is on the floor is it not
327253,though i suppose thats the same with this thing or maybe theyre keeping the red button private lol
327254,connecting to this its one of those things retail doesnt care about open source means nothing to the people in the phillipines it has helped raised from proverty i guess
327255,when you look at the biggest web3 companies they dont share these values
327256,everyone is using google analytics storing user ip address etc
327257,uniswap opensea etc
327258,opensea is web 25
327259,maybe moxie was right
327260,
327261,opensea web20 style hacks hacks contd
327262,i might be nitpicking here why is referred to as an opensea hackmight as well call it email hack i really dont see where opensea is responsible for users deciding to sign some malicious shit
327263,layer 2 rolling strikes and token burn
327265,that is a well known issue there is even an erc draft for fixing it but generally if you look at opensea there is a good reason why they are targeted eg look at the svg xss hack before high value target and also a lot of uneducated users that in fact is openseas responsiblity these are their users
327266,fact is openseas responsiblity these are their usersi cant agree with thatis opensea to be held responsible for people blindly signing txs with zero understanding of the way the system works
327267,when you profit my moneywhen you get rekt another persons faultnaisu
327268,it says a lot about average nft coooolector
327269,to be fair i think it says more about their mileage in this spacewanting others to protect you from yourself is web2 mentalityweb3 you take ownership of your action
327270,retail doesnt care about ownership they want to buy and sell colorful lottery tickets see traction of altl1s like bsc or solana fueled by these users
327271,agreed that phrasing it as opensea bughack is misleading
327272,theres nothing wrong with the actual validationmatchingtheres a design argument for not delegate calling arbitrary stuff tho ofc

327284,check this out compiled a list already based on recent academic researches twittercomimmunefistatus1493915073907425280
327285,also check out tmelobsters_chat327039 and tmelobsters_chat326925
327286,nope not from your wallet only if theyre stored in a contract similar to ethereum only in ethereum all tokens are stored always in contractssome projects are looking at more unique ways for how wallets and accounts behave so you can specifically provide access but im assuming not for weird stuff like infinite approval of random smart contracts and more for specialized behavior for instance giving your mobile wallet access to your ledger wallet for up to x tokens per day for instance
327287,sounds cool do you know where i can find those projects
327288,sent in dm
327289,hello lobsters maybe someone here can help and tell me about near and sharding how atomicity is preserved in near with sharding if it is there at all
327290,i think there is no atomicity but there is some form of sequential composability across shards takes several blocks instead of being atomic
327291,ty in short there is no atomicity
327292,gm guys can anybody share good sources related to web30 vcs fundraising pitching etc especially interested to see some pitchdecksso far found this really good channel but information is very limitedthanks in advance
327293,i would also like this and promise i will not front run the vc
327294,you can get pitch decks usually if you just ask founders in their respective telegram discord channels just be polite imho otherwise there was one airtable floating around ctrlf somehow with all almost crypto raises for full data
327295,
327296,hi all quick question please do you know place where i can get historical yield and burrowing rate in compound thanks in advance i found one for aave but struggling to find one for compound
327297,havent tried but you should be able to pull this data from flip side crypto
327298,thanks sam looking at it right now
327299,no luck there but thanks for your suggestion
327300,loanscan had an api
327301,i think it had the data you wanted
327302,but i am not sure if its functional anymore check intotheblock too they had ome of that data

327304,degenscore leaves clues twittercomdegenscorestatus1496483757368520707
327305,this has barely worked for me somehow even after being polite and im very early in stuff just get ignored in dms lmfao
327306,need to take a communications class aha
327307,there is no definite answer to that but imo if someone builds a system where users take actions then good education should be part of that on how to us it using opensea for beginner users is something like using linux without man pages and help in tools
327308,just to understand is the os bug fixed does this happen when you sign the new os contract how do i not get rekt here
327309,maybe dont trade hundreds of eth worth of jpegs if you dont understand it why would os be responsible for that
327310,
327311,you cant get rekt as long as your iq is above 0 and you understand that clicking a link someone sent you in email or is trying to get you to click on twitterdiscordtelegram is probably someone trying to scam you there was no bug just phishing basically
327312,ah okay so it has nothing to do with the new os contract it was an unofficial link that people clicked on
327313,what does the gasless stuff have to do with it though
327314,my iq is above 0 i checked but im still scared
327315,yep everyone was blaming migration contract at first but there was no bug someone just created a fake os and collected signatures when people wanted to list their nfts
327316,then after some time created a contract and technically bought all of them from people for 0 since that is what they signed
327317,is there a tool to check daos treasuries size treasuries containing native and stable tokens

327323,thanks for explaining like im 5
327325,can someone point me some resources on zk proofs the maths and also code implementations i only understand them conceptually
327326,check out sir twittercomravjot_status1482252484328718338also check out githubcommatterlabsawesomezeroknowledgeproofs
327327,guys does anybody have contacts of coinlist employees emails telegramsi have a whole set of issues with coinlist1 i want to convert usd to ust and withdraw ust but their conversion mechanism does not work2 i want to withdraw ust from the ust vault but the ust vault is no longer available in my country my money stayed there and i cant access it3 i was banned for no reason i used my real id and have never even managed to participate in sales my karma is 10004 i tried to contact the coinlist support via chat window in my profile it asks captcha the captcha does not load in any browser5 i filed several tickets via the support sent me 2 formal replies in 15 monthsive never had such poor customer experience this look like a poorly disguised rug pull the only thing i want at this point is to withdraw all my money from coinlist
327328,this is going to sound dumb but is there a way to edit the gas fee on metamask to be a set amount every time without manually editing it
327329,like suppose im trying to mint an nft and i want my gas to super high normally id have to edit it on metamask by hand but is there a way to preset the fee
327330,if you have significant amount just wire from coinlist to your local bank
327331,3 months and still no kyc verification from coinlist feels bad when they took all my details but i got nothing in return
327332,also feels scammy when the communication is so bad
327333,so ive decided to boycott them
327334,i dont think so because the gas amount is estimated based on the transaction youre trying to do
327335,and based on current network gas price estimates
327336,fight fight fight
327337,that is truea guess a nice feature would be some preset features that sets gas really high or somethingthanks
327338,theres this
327339,is it possible to track from which ip the transaction was sent if user uses public rpc
327340,this is a great website also worth checking cryptostatscommunitydiscover
327341,is their production ready i thought theyre just option vault
327342,lobsters whats your bet on one of these other sc platforms dethroning eth who are you guys backing whose leading on scalability and tps

327351,sure you can start from daily topicsnewsand ask questions here as well will help you with infoopinionsdatalinks
327352,you can play with formula from the curve wpbut michwill can advise something more practical i think
327353,
327354,thanks
327355,still figuring out the math
327356,are these methods used to search for exploiters on networks i have not heard of a single case of hacker capture except for bitfinex
327357,yes commonly used i described mostly used methods here as well twittercomofficer_ciastatus1493395239905734667often such cases are solved privately without going to the police just throwing the hacker his own data this is like an iceberg usually he goes along with it when scared if we are talking about well known public scandal cases there was a news story about a 17yearold canadian hacker and a several stories are coming to my mind as well
327358,offtopicwise any good tg chat about linux administration not for noobs

327400,pump f jpegs
327401,lmao going full adhd based jpeg valued
327402,anyone that uses ledger and metamask often i will get a 0 nonce and then will not get prompted to sign txn on ledger i have to reboot computer and then it works as expected for a few days then it happens again am i missing some setting or is ledgermm just shitty
327404,id suggest trying a fresh chromium browser with metamask extension brave bromite chrome or edge install no plugins except metamask it may be other wallets interfering just a wild guess
327406,do we have an article post on what the the best hardware wallets are also do we have a poll history theres so much value in going through previous polls of a group like this
327407,ive seen firefox fixing the problem or similar problems before
327408,
327409,ahhhhhhhhhhhh
327410,failed ones didnt use some check where if you are already amount noneligible it consumes low gas oxngmi
327411,idk if that can be done i know we did it w merkle claim but idk if here is same
327412,honestly having failing transactions while flashbot protect rpc exsits is too 2021
327413,the high gas cost isnt due to the erroring out failing late in execution presumably its due to the high base fee ivangbi
327414,but in all seriousness it would be good if suggested in mint pages
327415,none of the blocks that got minted were from flasbots if you used flashbots you wouldnt have been able to mint anything
327416,furthermore afaik flashbots only includes the first txs or just 1 tx idk of a block so it wouldnt have worked im not sure about that so i asked both publicly and dmd some people that work at flashbots about it but didnt get an answer so we didnt tell people to use that rpc
327417,i know that flashbots only included the first tx in a block im not sure if this is the case still
327418,weird since they are supposed to have a massive chunk of the miners bad luck id guess
327419,nah afaik flashbots its enabled to add as much as txs as it can include in the block but i have found some edge cases on how they eval what tx to include
327420,broke it a couple of times
327421,ah makes sense tho
327422,was not shitting on you btw with regards to protect rpc
327423,this block has 10 flashbots mints afaik
327424,its true that if we had the check for total supply way earlier in our code that would have saved some gas costs for failing txs however people are blowing this out of proportion since a large part of gas costs are fixed things such as signature verification so any tx will consume them
327425,
327426,i might be wrong i havent checked myself just quoting someone who said it
327427,yeah there were mints on flashbots
327428,ok perfect got it thanks definitely interesting work u did there the pics look cute id have minted but no wl
327429,not bashing at all ser the opposite
327430,tbh the risk analysis was this flashbots works great some people save gas costs flashbots has some issue that prevents people from minting eg only a few txs can be included too much tx volume causes it to go down it may have some edge cases that break it every user wouldnt have been able to mint and only bots would have people would have flamed us a lot for it
327431,since i didnt know about this one and people couldnt get back to me on time i opted to not ask people to switch to flashbots
327432,a large amount was still botted tho
327433,seems like a reasonable analysis also making users go to protect would have put the burden on you and we know how the ecosystem incentives are lol
327434,yeah im still not sure if that was the right decision
327435,i has just been molested
327436,may i ask what is pleb
327437,what drop
327438,if u r asking ser u r one sorry
327439,or you are talking to one
327440,i want not to be a pleb ser
327442,i might have lost seed to my 120 lobster wallet
327443,buy moar lobs
327444,bullish
327445,lobs admin burnt 120 lobs
327446,worth 250 eth

327460,1password and phantom wallet liked your reply
327461,it would be comical if it wasnt so expensive
327462,btw ivan this chat belongs to nft avenue
327463,extremely bullish for lobs
327464,pls dont break the rules next time
327465,call vitalik to reset the password private key
327466,ok enough nft talk ivangbi pls call ethrium support or cry in nft avenue thx
327467,btw anyone knows wtf is going on with radial
327468,seems like nothing _
327469,and here i was just this morning considering buying one myself
327470,you can lp it to get another shitcoin that you can dump
327471,nan
327472,and thats it
327473,i hope they are just joking wrt to the otc shit
327474,seems to me this is just a frustrated take on what the community is asking in the general chat but who knows
327475,nan
327476,ivangbi delete if inappropriate
327477,nah is weird is slow and i am not comfy in multisig tbh but eh they not rugging so is ok
327478,i am not joking i cant find the seed to 120 lobs wallet its not funny
327479,rly
327480,why were you looking for it planning on dumping on us to recoupe the stonks losses
327481,no claiming z airdrops
327482,what airdrops did i miss something in the last few days
327483,thats in lobsterdao not here lobsterdrops
327484,yep sorry gonna check
327485,damn that sucks
327486,nan
327487,this is a joke right
327488,no
327489,youre using trustwallet ser
327490,trustwallet support will help
327491,you just need your seed for their google form
327492,oh wait
327493,
327494,does one device have some certain algo it gives u those seeds cause a device itself is a semiseed idk just saying bs
327495,destiny
327496,trustwallet has a recovery phrase just like others
327497,so your whole trustwallet missing or just one wallet within
327498,and you are building gearbox hope you manage to secure that seeds better
327499,i deleted wallet within backed up into a safe place and well i backed myself out
327500,ser all of us use like 50 wallets it happens as for gearbox dont worry about their capability
327501,i hope lobsterdao nfts die now
327502,like genuinely go to 0 and rug
327503,
327504,i jut made 3 wallets back then for quick stuffto make paper one and removeand just fucking resaved 1 screenshot as sameall irrelavnt wallets i didnt use and screenshots are safethis one is rekt
327505,guys any idea why is the mim usdc stable pool on solidly so skewed its currently 112somehow the variable pool is more stable than the stable pool
327506,lobster nft v2 confirmed
327507,because no one wants mim
327508,nah mate the variable pool is close to 11
327509,but the stable pool makes no sense
327510,what do you mean makes no sense they have stable and variable pool on solidly
327511,i know i mean the proportion makes no sense
327512,i think it was created with the wrong parameters and moreover it isnt taken into consideration by aggregators life firebird i tried swapping directly into that pool for some arb using the solidly ui but i am dumb and didnt find a way
327513,25m usdc and 32 mim over the stable pool
327514,also the binspiritspirit stable pool was fucked up when i checked a day ago as well as linspiritspirit the variable version was ok tho
327515,lobs todaily 1 ivan rekt 2 peeps discussed shitcoins trading
327516,try brcreover once wrote my ledger seed phrase wrongly and it helped
327517,its a lot quicker if you are only missing a few words
327518,happy to help you via dms
327519,
327520,1 i made some trust wallets cause it was all happening quickly like 4 back then at same time i minted and forgot it never used again 2 for better security i took screenshots wifi off etc to save it safely and essentially use as paper wallet if whenever they hit 100 eth floor took offline3 i made multiple backups and ofc removed it from my phone4 the screenshots i saved for that wallet i accidentally screenshotted the other one twice and missed this seed phrase screenshot5 so i have 4 files all with different appropriate names but 2 of them are same seed phrase and its even an empty one insteadis a rug i quit ps just checked all seeds no i f forgot to take the screenshot of the screen of the main wallet i just messed up thats it never cross checked
327521,rekt
327522,if trust wallet somehow makes seeds based on the hardware device its on maybe can be done but i doubt
327523,yeh btc recover is still a very long shot you can narrate the search range if you know the address but its literally like pissing in the wind
327524,havent used trust wallet but should they all have the same seed phrase ie just different derivation paths
327525,would have been easy ofc but no its diff 12 word seed every time
327526,two longshot ideasa i remember trustwallet annoying me into taking a data backup may not have happened to you thoughb if i recall correctly you need to reenter the seed phrase before using the walletc if the device is rarely used there are a tiny chance that you could recover an overwritten screenshotnot sure if this is helpful but wanted to share just in case
327527,b sure i did doesnt help much tho it was ages agoc this could be done or if durov sends me a deleted screenshot from 6 months ago
327528,so during the transfer of screenshots from your phone to your backup location u renamed the files or did u take screenshots of the same seed twice then transferred
327530,took screenshots send to myself made names for files put in safe place deleted
327531,this happens to me at work all the time btw
327532,ye its regulr fucking up w file names tbh plus screenshots look all same in preview same screen
327533,
327534,iphone delete delete recently deleted 6mo ago
327535,mhm what i find is overwritten files in any backup system is hard to recover purely deleted files can be recovered in most cases
327536,damn didnt know you had iphone
327537,you use iphone
327538,icloud
327539,fuc android
327540,i think there is a way to recover
327541,let me check
327542,anybody knows the required dance to make uniswap complain about your token not being traded and stops warning users about itthe token has been listed in multiple dexes and cexes yet uniswap is no no bad token
327543,tragic boating accident
327544,a quick search led me to this hope it helps
327545,there is an app called fonepaw looks you can backup your screenshot files
327546,check if it works to u bru
327547,hello it will be impossible to restore this seed no devicespecific data is used for that
327548,nan
327549,in the previous versions were used time stamps and other combinations were to generate this seed but now it is done with help of no pseudorandom info
327550,at this point i think the only way is trying to find any app that can backup your phone files till you get back to the screenshots day i guess this is possible
327551,you need to have mobile backup data in your mac for that
327552,do you have backups for the mobile device that was used in this failure
327553,if yes you could try to restore it from previous snapshots
327554,these snapshots will have an old version of the apps and you have a small chance to restore it
327555,
327556,omg
327557,it is a nice list but it is a bit too much noise from these crypto experts
327558,
327559,tetras new pdump
327560,been looking for any code about the chainlink oracle they use for punks
327561,i dont see how a reliable chainlink oracle for punk prices can be made
327562,unless punks are traded in multiple markets i dont know this myself
327563,the one with the 1 rare lobster
327564,yes
327565,ur prog so far found 3 year old tinder girls nudes but not the f seeds can i sell those to substtute my lobbies henkreative30
327566,sure thanks for feedback some ideas give me im not an expert yet new opportunities to think from a different point of view maybe it will be interesting to someone else
327567,hahaha to be honest i never used that software bro just asked few friends because im worried about u
327568,time for dao voting reboot lob nfts with much better art
327569,yeah it is nice list and it was a great job done
327570,i need it to mint my own lobsters
327571,thanks ser
327572,read the above ivangbi went out of his way to give an example
327573,they sound a bit young to be on tinder
327574,i like my untextured lobs but lets vote to mint from treasury
327575,nah anyway prog didnt find what i needed thanks for guys oleg henry especially is a rug i quit ps just checked all seeds no i f forgot to take the screenshot of the screen of the main wallet i just messed up thats it never cross checked
327576,is there any research paper or article explaining the approaches to be considered when dealing with a split in liquidity from separating the settlement and the execution layers in ethereum maybe it is a naive question but how the ecosystem of different l2s will evolve keeps intriguing me and i cant find an obvious answer for that i do not find explicit references to this problem either
327577,maybe it uploaded screenshots to google photos or icloud
327578,icloud may have snapshots at that time
327579,i never have icloud on useless tech
327580,does anybody knows why everything solidly related is dumping sell the news
327581,dont know if price talk is allowed dont ban me ivan i can remove
327582,price not allowed but i assume just expectations are hyped wor low supplies lack of info all of it
327583,love the lack of info makes it so much more degen and insider orientated
327584,look at old files on iphone from deleted deleted the prog did not show though look at backups i never make em tho look at icloud turned off for photos look at any software trust wallet breach which is not realistic look at how telegram stores 4mo messages attachments which were deletedonly ways to get it
327585,very likely rekt sry
327586,telegram does store the attachments
327587,if you can find the message the attachment will be there
327588,sorry not attachments photo sent to myself and obviously deleted months ago
327589,may be you can ask telegram for gdpr export telegram might store deleted photos from saved messages not sure tho gdpr export would tell
327590,so likely rekt just fun to explore
327591,trying costs nothing
327592,telegram barely cooperates with hardcore law enforcement agencies they wont budge on this
327593,i hope u guys pump wo me
327594,not sure whether it was here already
327595,tldr they wanna ban pow
327596,eth pos for the win
327597,if you think they would stop at a pow ban i got a bridge to sell you
327598,i wonder if there is different source than btcecho
327599,i mean if dao decides to reimburse you in some way you cant do anything against it
327600,no i could not find one all english sources point to the btcecho article in german why do you wonder anything wrong with them
327601,never heared of them before this article and was just curious if anybody else reports this
327603,if no way to restore found dao should vote to airdrop you from treasury
327604,any good fantom rpc
327605,ftmrpcultimatenodesio
327606,legit
327607,was recommended by the byte masons not to long ago i use it
327608,it says network error for me
327609,sorry did u use the full address
327610,can you explain the dangers of using a bad rpc to a smoothbrain
327611,slower txs and higher fees
327612,yes
327613,im trying to send tx with 3 different rpc but nothing works
327614,keeps spinning
327615,eek might not be a node issue
327616,it even says could not fetch chain id with yours
327617,im pretty sure it is
327618,it worked till 10 minutes ago
327619,sometimes i get the same issue on firefox so it is not a solution
327620,anyone here participating in solidly seems to not be working very well currently good bit of ui bugs perhaps
327621,so going into the browsers extension manager and toggling metamask off and then back on fixes it super annoying none the less but it does fix it until it happens again
327623,yes
327624,not enough balance something something
327626,i dont think rewards are working for solidly either
327627,have been staked for 20 mins and zero rewards to claim
327628,thats probably just the nft holder by design think lots aint passing it along
327629,i got some but it worked after some times
327630,what do you mean you cant just deposit your liquidity in an lp and get rewards
327631,the filter function to see deposit lp is unnecessary should be improved on the ui
327632,tarot has a feature now called boostmax that gives you 25x boost on solidly lps
327633,claimable solid
327634,do you know the difference between stable and variable lps for solidly by any chance
327635,stable lps are for like kind assets stable coins pools wbtcrenbtc volatile lps are for uncorrelatedvolatile asset pairs altcoinwftm if you look at the vote page you can see what pairs have emission votes from nft holding protocols and then you can see if that pair is volatile or stable if you dont know by looking at the two assets
327636,nice how come there are variable pools with stables as well with diff balances ie not 5050
327637,id imagine because people dont know what they are doing and the ui allows one to choose between variable and stable
327638,why are all the stable pools on solidly unbalanced
327639,i used the variable version for the stable lps but yeah its strange
327640,ya i have all my lps staked on tarot boostmax which is actually functional claimable and on solidex which is apparently having issues the solidly ui was not showing rewards and you are right the stable pools are all out of whack at least in the ui dont feel like making a bad move and jumping in an out of balance stable pool gonna let everything calm down fantom is moving really slow as well
327641,solidex appear to have screwed up the voting contract which was deployed unverified all early partners currently have no voteweight for this period
327642,the guys at tarot are true professionals
327643,shouldnt it be equal for the first emissions then apply the votes for week 2 i have not actually looked into it but spitballing
327644,disagree the project is still unaudited to best of my knowledge which i can understand in this climate but at the very least implement a bug bounty to fill the gap until then for such a complex project that cares enough about compliance it blocks me from using it without a vpn in canada its surprising that it hasnt implemented either of these features
327645,ive met them irl my impression was standup dudes with a strong drive towards true decentralization
327646,thats nice and i dont mean to slight their character but theres definitely work to be done
327647,can confirm being pleasant irl is good an all but by our standards there is still much work to do
327648,the vpn comment stands out as a for legitimacy but i hear the comments on bug bountyaudit and agree
327649,sr for stupid question could i use stable coins as gas when using zksync l2 eth
327650,initial observations on the usdcmim pool on solidly the non incentivized volatile pool which i dont know why anyone would deposit to that is almost perfectly in balance with relatively low tvlthe incentivized stable pool way out of balance 1 usdc 118 mim with a ton of tvl
327651,cant even arbitrage it at least not in the swap ui
327652,exactly so not really sure if the imbalance matters
327653,idk ser but doesnt look very professional and trustworthy
327654,whole launch is a complete shitshow
327655,whats more weird is that when looking at adding to the usdcmim pool its overweight mim but when you select stable pair it wants you to put in more mim
327657,
327658,
327659,why is this contract not verified
327660,the reason i ask is solidly ui doesnt seem to show my lp position are we testing in prod again
327661,whats the best way to find startup projects running by anon
327662,yes you can use stables to pay for gas but i think the full list of acceptable coins is decided by the node operators
327663,hm it is quite complicated
327664,i think i will use eth for gas btw ty
327665,is anyones trasnsactions on fantom going through i upped gas and still pending
327666,51024198 gwei ftm gas tracker ftmscan
327667,its pretty unstable right now and high gas
327668,oof 5k gas i was upping to 2k thats the problem thanks
327670,blz let me in wtf is that
327671,i just bought some coins on spiritswap but transaction is not confirmed yet anyone knows if it will be confirmed as the current price when the network activity decreases if the price falls and the transaction is not confirmed yet i may try again with high gas fee and buy with low price if the price rises will my transaction be confirmed anyway with the current price in a few days
327672,better do swap again with 5k gwei fee if your transaction didnt confirmed in 5 seconds most likely it will not be confirmed at al
327673,i struggle to understand solidly i can see that the most incentivised pool is usdcvewe but the weve token is not even shown in the ui when i want to trade etc
327674,evidence to suggest thats reaper carving out a little corner for itself
327676,hey maxisim building shunya app multichain lens to track your defi portfolio right now you can track all your postions of compound aave uniswap curve finance makerdao with indetailed report of your holdingsi would like share access to defi maxis degens here get your feedback please dm me here for referral rt this for good karma talk to you soon credit to prat_jain who introduced me to this community thankssai
327677,small tip go to the liquidity page on the upper right side there is a sort of filter icon downward facing triangle click it and deselect my deposit this will show every pool click on the one you like and the token field will autopopulate
327678,
327679,not discussing politics just sharing finance stuff
327684,please take care of yourself we really want every single one of you to stay alive healthy and unharmed please lets leave this place free of such discussions its very scary for everyone im praying with you for peace
327685,actually its even worse
327690,i think theyll just halt trading like it was in 2008
327691,if not already
327692,ru market has no circuit breakers at 7 or this is futures so no breaker
327693,they suspended trading for a couple of hours the index crashed 50 after they reopened
327694,this is spot circuit breakers for derivatives working like this hit price limit if price is holding increase price limit increase margin requirements repeat several times for spot prices limits are generally wider since leverage is lower
327695,hey yall what do you think about data defi do you think we will see a big boom soon other than ocean have you seen any projects that are doing this
327696,data is next big thing in defi you will see good usecases around this soon
327697,i agree being able to get liquidity for data is mind blowing imo
327698,also
327699,can we ban crypto short selling too pls
327700,seafood
327701,lobster daily 311 daily recap february 221 complex option strategieslink link to discussion link to discussion 2 austrian programmer and ex crypto ceo likely stole 11 billion of etherlink link to discussion 3 is there a salary payment dapp that distributes pay to walletslink to discussion 4 are we getting closer to prediction platforms on eth with the zksync announcementlink to discussion 5 warning on an exploit type that can take place when interacting with dsdlink to discussion
327702,hey sers i work on degenscore and am wondering does anyone know someone who can put me in touch with andrew yang or someone from his group thinking of doing a chat room for degens around web3 and policy they are rolling out this program so thought it would be relavent
327703,
327704,mb try bankless guys they did an interview with him at ethdenver
327705,yeah thats great thank you
327706,data noob here could you point me in a direction to learn more about this stuff i stumble upon the data availability layer but not much beyond basics thanks
327707,maybe you partner with xdao i think community tokens fit perfectly with the dao
327708,ocean have a really good intro try it here
327709,
327710,hopefully u get lost down the rabbit hole
327711,best way to retreive a certain wallet holdings on a specific date for tax purposeszerion only goes back one year and its not accurate with defi staking
327712,and for binance as well
327713,have of my money is in the ust vault and i cant unstake them they just closed the vault for people from my jurisdiction
327714,there is a new function where you can do that you need to activate it in advance settings and edit the gas fee and check a box
327715,does anyone have any examples of what compensation looks like for external multisig folks in various projects
327716,keeping it low whilst providing half decent incentive for people to sign quicklybe active
327717,i love this channel
327719,also posted on twitter twittercomlobsters_daily
327720,0 maybe gas fees
327721,im sorry they have one of the worst support have you replied to the email that sends the automated support email i had luck getting someone once
327722,banteg should be able to help you guys have quite a few
327723,
327724,oops yearn has launched on arbitrum nice waiting for more pools
327725,is brent available anywhere on the blockchain
327726,twittercom0xvikingstatus1496835532495671297
327728,fair enough lol
327738,does anyone get fantom transactions to work tried multiple rpcs seems completely rekt
327739,yes i feel like its more of a metamask issue of not finding the right gas price than ftmwhat it worked for me is to look into for the gasprice and edit it for every transaction
327740,
327741,nah its not a gas price thing for me metamask isnt sending the transactions out into the p2p network
327743,sometimes disableenable metamask extension
327744,tried on multiple computers
327745,its an rpc thing
327746,they appear to be all rekt
327747,hi lobsters im trying to get my anchor terra balances using pythonthink i need to use the terra python sdk and the call contract_querycontract_address query_msg but have no clue how to do soany chance someone here can help w that thanks
327748,the quickest place to have this answered is the terra discord the dev chat is super friendly there
327749,got it thanks samuel will try there
327750,is there a publicly accessible curated database that maps contract addresses to some form of human nameeg etherscan has a friendly name opensea registry for im looking for a facility that doesnt necessarily rely on etherscans api and preferably includes other chains
327751,no data on solidly loads for me unfortunately with or without vpn s
327752,same here ui doesnt works very well metamask issues
327753,does anybody know how to get binance holdings of account at a certain date
327754,i tried importing history with the api in ftx and delta but the graph is trash in both and completely not accurate
327755,i saw a post about a derivatives protcol recently where all of the funding rates we baked into the token basically just hold the tokens does anyone remember seeing this and remember the name
327756,uxd protocol
327757,there is also lemma finance
327759,howdy frensdoes anyone knows if theres like a existing tool or dune dashboard created to watch apys from solidly pools
327760,
327761,search github lots of terra anchor github projects some in python
327762,
327763,i feel that having an etf style option vault to outperform market or say even have a consistent yield is hard the iv theta gain has reduced a lot since ribbon first started lot of the vaults i see are deploying 10 delta otm strategy or 20 away otm strategies this approach feels very nonsustainable and to do well computation will have to move offchain to make room for sophesticated strategies with rebalancing according to greek exposure
327764,something like what gamma strategiesvizor finance is doing with their uniswap lp strategies
327765,vote for low risk dovs
327766,also even the strategy that doesnt outperform the market could benefit trader via beta dovs lessen the correlation with the market
327767,vote for multistrategy dovs
327768,most covered calls have massively underperformed the market during the whole bull run now the same is going with cash secured put vaults as markets are going down
327769,isnt it predictable like choose dov acc to your market position
327770,more of a guessing game though in a 1520 delta move going against you investors will lose capital
327771,is solidex accurate now
327772,dovs are very interesting though if executed correctly ribbon is moving more towards offchain computation for strike price decision making
327773,from what i understand they use an autoregressive model to calculate volatility something like an arch model to calculate volatility and range
327774,that would mean active management not what most people are comfortable with
327775,
327776,first they ban selling now they erase losses must be nice
327777,two different school of thoughts onchain is tricky and you can only do so much which becomes more of an etf model ribbon is moving in the other direction but doing it systematically
327778,
327779,not sure if pantera people are credible at all but sharing anyway
327780,did check to see if it had been mentioned but beware if youre staking lps on solidly and you want to add or remove from your position you will lose your accrued rewards unless you claim before you do anything else
327781,makes sense at opium they decided to take strikes as far from atthemoney as possible but still liquid and use 2x leverage to improve yiled and capital efficiencyneutral vega is a next step not always possible with current infrastructure
327782,hi anyone know where i can find stats on number of apps deployed on each utility token
327783,rishabh_narang tandeloff the whole idea of my article that dov is not a passive return strategy its amplification of your market positioning
327784,yes exactly if the price condition is satisfied on maturity i am happy to buy low sell high
327785,you should be able to claim previously acrrued reward with claim all button
327786,they dont disappear its a ui issue
327788,i hit claim on that particular position and i did not get my previous 12 hour rewards ive just hit claim all so will see
327789,can confirm lost previous rewards
327790,thanks will have a look
327791,looking for more ux feedback and other feedback on a 0 commussion sports betting platform dm me if interested
327793,maybe btc can do the same
327794,is anyone aware of a group telegramdiscordetc where ukrainians are organizing themselves to help each other
327795,please dm him i know him from chats for a long time he is in lobsters chat as well twittercomniarbnotnastatus1496856444334796801 niarbnotna
327796,cant dm for some reason got banned
327797,dm me
327799,basis dot markets is another i think
327806,
327808,yes i do crypto initiative with our guys and foreignersdm me to be added
327811,no politics even what people are saying seems right above is for help it stays
327817,bitmex founders hayes and delo plead guilty in us prosecution link doj
327818,lol just beat me to it
327820,hayes and delo each agreed to separately pay a 10 million criminal fine representing pecuniary gain derived from the offense hayes and delo pled guilty today before us district judge john g koeltlhayes 36 of miami florida and delo 38 of the united kingdom and hong kong pled guilty to one count each of violating the bank secrecy act which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison the maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by congress and is provided here for informational purposes only as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge
327821,hayes will convert all his cellmates to crypto hodlers
327822,10 million coconut
327823,pay the government who keeps it not redispursed to the people it came from love it gib
327824,heychristopher forwarding this from another group that i was in i hope its relevant cheers
327825,gm fam revmiller and some other top builders in ukraine ie illia from near are organising a fundraising campaign for humanitarian aid for ukraine to help during this crisis and enable web3 community to provide some support were about to launch a website and more info theyll be a multi sig with trusted public figures to co ordinate the funds raised and probably thatll happen via some nft sale were also trying to coordinate and collab with on the ground orgs to help folks evacuate and get their families somewhere safe in the meantime pls join and wed highly appreciate your support in getting the word out and adding anyone to the group you might think could add value to our mission and the ppl of ukraine
327826,true but we dont know what the sentencing will be max term is scary for a 36 year old
327827,they pled to the charges so the term is probably already decided upon
327832,5 years isnt that scary when you have that much money lolyou dont even do the full 5 years so he would come out at 40 years old with more wealth than people have in several lifetimes
327833,considering this is a plea deal theres likely no jail time or it would have already been agreed to of course the judge has to sign off on the agreement but the announcement sounds like they agreed to 10 million per defendant and no jail time
327834,yeah likely zero jail
327835,of course theyre a mafia
327836,is there any competitor of hotnewcrypto
327837,this has happened to mejust now
327838,any ways to fix it
327839,there should be a way to call the contract or something right
327841,i seeded the ftmweth pool on solidly two weeks ago
327842,but it has never shown up under my liquidity
327843,nan
327844,anyone else having this problem with their lp on solidly
327845,click this and adjust filters
327846,everything is turned on
327847,hahahaha
327848,and just like that it finally appeared
327849,thanks mrm33seeks
327850,i expect more updates to the site some kinks perhaps cheers
327851,the lp only shows up on chrome on firefox i get this error
327852,id look for help in the solidly discord or tg gl
327854,solidly def needs ui upgrades looks nice but doesnt click when it needs to and on mobile it just weirds out
327855,not all of them but like 10 of the supply eth to polygon
327856,agree its a bit confusing even in pc
327857,
327858,i missed it all but the how i am playing it seems retarded a bit
327859,its fully a gambling spree of new farms in new farms
327860,
327861,nevertheless
327862,michael chen
327863,hm
327864,is chen in charge of solidex
327865,solidly is exactly why i love defi insane rewards at the moment buggy ui tokens being lost through claims fantom bogged down feels like the good old days
327866,bastardo is
327867,and in charge is maybe a strong word more like smashing hands on keyboard
327868,exactly max nostalgia
327869,ahah
327870,maybe a dumb question but the solidly stable pools work via reservers and are therefore almost always unbalanceddo i have a risk of getting iled when i deposit unbalanced eg usdcmim
327871,noone seems to care ppl just ape in
327872,the reserve balance is the ratio of current price but since the assets are 11 it wont effect underlying totals or il
327873,those pools arent unbalanced thats how their reserves work since its concentrated around 1 its not xyk pools which are 5050
327874,very different concepts
327875,thank you that makes sense
327876,an lp still has to deposit at the current ratio for the stable pools correct its not possible to deposit any ratio or even 1 sided like curve right
327877,correct
327878,got it ty just wanted to make sure i was lping correctly
327879,so if we deposit to usdcmim at 112 ratio and withdraw when its at 111 there is il
327880,no since your ratios would be the same
327881,if you deposit now you deposit less usdcmore mim if you withdraw then yout get back more usdcless mim
327883,ok thanks
327884,then solidex seems to have a calculation issue on the balanceworth of the lps that got me a bit worried i missunderstood it d
327885,l can not approve or swap anything on fantom any solution
327886,yeah was being brought up in their discord relentlessly but seems thats just an ui issue
327887,more gas
327888,is it still broken
327889,being trying to use it since yesterday
327890,spent like 20ftm in failed tx this morning it appears we can t do much more
327891,oh i see its ftm not solidly edit ok i give up for now this is worst than solana on period days
327892,higher apy comes with worse experiecen its a tradeoff
327893,is there a way to force sending tx which are not eip1559 with metamask or maybe with frame
327894,with metamask only if installing an older version pre eip1559
327895,is there another fantom rpc then the normal because it throws me continous rpc errors on solidly
327896,the solidex ui doesnt show my lp tokens anyone else facing the same problem
327897,you probably staked in solidly or you lp stable instead of variable or the other way around
327898,its for the stable usdcfrax pool and certainly not staked can see on solidly ui
327899,these 2 are the most reliable alternatives
327900,have you tried hitting max anyway often its 0000xx lp token so shows 0
327901,yes i tried the liquidity doesnt display on solidly website either not sure if its an rpc issue
327902,and you can gamble if solidex will be able to fix voting for next week
327903,possibly you staked in gauge on solidly rather than just depositing lp
327904,i am able to withdraw my liquidity but the ui doesnt show it in liquidity list
327905,also check it you joined the right pool one time i joined the variable instead of stable pool so didnt show up under solidex
327906,i deposited lp withdrew and deposited lp again just to be sure
327907,the token i received back after adding lp is sammusdcfrax
327909,fantom works fine for me adding 200gwei each transaction on top of the proposed value in mm and in solidly its a lot of strgf5
327910,well it works not really fine but it worksjust pamp those feesandre killed ftm chain
327911,do you know tools to discover nfts anyone working on something in this space
327912,the problem lies with the rpcs and gas estimations from wallets the chain is fine
327913,i can help you out sir dm me with your requirement i can add this feature in our shunya fi app
327914,ether scan export transactions
327915,will check it out thank you
327916,problem is that it only report txs but i would just need the balances on a certain date from the wallet holdings defi holdings
327919,try bloxyinfo
327920,i think it only shows holdings on certain dates though not staked stuff
327921,
327922,theyre still finding those in 2022
327923,better than nothing thanks
327924,check gastracker on ftmscan before sending transaction metamask cant keep up with fantoms speed
327925,it was an absolute shitshow solidly exchange for me as an end user i respect the builders a lot but this was not ready by stretch of the imaginationyou still need something to break for move fast and break things and that thing wasnt there as far as i can see ui is incredibly buggy at least for me it cant even show the basic things like what i deposited or my rewards when i tried to see if i could do it from the contract i ended up seeing finding an unverified contract deployment so purely from a fairly advanced end user perspective this was a horrible experience for me i am not sure we are that early in crypto lifetime to keep launching in this manner with no attention paid to ui bugs ux etc
327926,you know if you guys think crypto launches are shit and you all can do better there is an easy fix to that problem
327927,lol you know all those issues are rpc and not the app right
327928,but yeah ill look forward to your far superior launch
327929,so much bitching everywhere when theres about 6 people in this group who could launch a protocol as complex as solidly
327930,if free public rpcs are too slow for you go build a better one if solidlys launch is shit then fork it and do it better all more productive options than complaining about the state of web3 and crypto launches
327931,this attitude will onboard the next billion of users and fulfil the crypto ethos i am not attacking you but this was my experience i run pokt nodes so understand rpc a bit
327932,lol if its another billion like you please tell me where i can unsubscribe
327933,great launch sir
327934,fantastic experience i had you changed my mind
327936,thats mass adoption ser wdym
327937,coming from web2 i see no difference in the amount of chaos and initial problems
327938,coming from irl mega projects dealing with coalitions of actors i see no difference in the amount of chaos and initial problems the crux is the testing in prod or implementing while planning it fits the 21 st century but it has a price
327939,true the usual approach at least on startuplike projects where i come from is to launch a beta mvp or to a shortlist of early adoptersid say in current defi world most of the userbase are the early adopters
327940,can someone tell what this error means
327943,is there any liquidity for the actual solid token somewhere all seems to be in solidsexsolid pair but no liquidity into solid itself
327944,spookyswap had some use firebird to get a better pricing among different liq sources
327945,spooky has 300k ish
327946,thanks
327947,cant tell what the error is but usually upping the gas price solves the issue at least for me check gastracker on ftmscan and add 200 to the minimum displayed there
327949,i get that error when i attempt to load the rewards page nothing to do with gas for me
327950,same
327951,ftm gas has spiked and metamask sync isnt working
327952,i also made the mistake i am sure i added to stable pool but deposited into a vamm i can see the lp in wallet i can hard refresh site but it will not allow me to withdraw invalid balance
327953,but does show me the lp under liquidity lol i guess what i get for being an idiot
327955,hello everyonecan you please tell me where i can read the true information regarding what solidly as well as solidex and radial which build on ituse it
327956,i mean what is this how will it work which tech will it use etc
327957,machi is back
327958,you can read the medium articles of solidly and solidex
327984,this is not the right place to discuss it i suggest ending convo about war here ivangbi also dont spread news there most of them are fake now regarding from whom they come from
328011,hm why tag anyway generally i would say yes no politics please unless its a life threateningcase hope you are all ok
328013,thank you for understandingi hope you are all safe
328014,so far the launch as been great enjoy the ui as well can you speak to yearn fantom planning on adding solidly lps where the strat would be to stake in solidex then farm and dump solid and sex if its not yearn it will be someone else i am sure all part of the game
328015,wheres the apy show on solidly
328016,spookyswap and beets
328017,andre superior launch its shocking how many people cant write a js function comprehend basic defi primitives use a blockchain scanner perform basic math and readbut at the same time are so entitled that they arent made ultra rich in 48 hours off of someone elses work and also entitled to blame everyone but themselves hanging out in the solidex tg and discords is a mix of cringe and embarrassment for how defi illiterate and generally illiterate the masses are i generally view this as bullish as i can navigate the waters around them profitably this has been the greatest income per hour in my defi experience and i have been farming since 2020
328018,bullish
328019,nice to hear so chaddish stuff actually solid stuff weak pun i know
328020,i heard ser charlie and ser andre are throwing haymakers in lobsterdao tg
328021,by farming you mean dumping some token i have no idea about solidly unfortunately
328022,the best answer for the rpc issues crypto suffers is pocket network
328023,fellow lobs who are deep in solidly my general strat has been to farm all lps on solidex harvest solid venft lock sex sexwftm lp stake on solidex obviously once the next epoch happens and solidex fixes the voting fuckup the rewards for the sex native lps will drastically decrease two points questions 1 will my venft rebase and preserve my share of solid ownership aka the 33 component 2 how to value sex alone it is relatively worthless but since it can be used to get tokenized venft i would imagine that it is a proxy to the price of solid since its emissions move w solid emissions when they fix the fuckup and emissions decrease do you think that will cause a decrease in the price of sex aka im trying to figure out when to vacate the sexwftm lp
328024,also another point big ol positive feedback loop fly wheel if you are like me you have been farming on fantom for sometime accumulated a lot of fantom ecosystem lps and now they are printing solidly rewards the emissions of solidly are game changing but they also dont dilute these ecosystem lps and will benefit those other protocols for which these lps represent buying the dips in preparation for solidly was the move also shout out to ivangbi the radial airdrop for lob nft holders and the radial bootstrapping ceremony was a big win christ
328025,also shout out to ivangbi the radial airdrop for lob nft holders and the radial bootstrapping ceremony was a big win christaable and radial airdrops got actually pretty big i am not happy per se that radial has nothing out yet but its one of the many opportunities anyway the important part is that quality and attention of lobsters are not diluted in case some of them become soso cause there is no direct push for marketing or engagement people see it and act themselves that seems like a fine thin line to me idk
328026,interestingthis is a great project actuallycurious to know if you have considered for fantom andrecronje afaik pokt doenst have fantom rpc yet
328027,rpc error
328028,try this one
328029,all good thank you
328030,id still add another network in your mm w this rpc just to have on deck for when shit gets really overloaded
328031,
328032,with regards to fantom rpcs this site was a handy tool for a humble farmer the last couple of days
328033,
328034,another nebula
328036,inverse rug for lobsters holders
328037,imposter
328038,its right that the variable pool is split more equally than the stable one its like univ2 vs curve
328039,
328040,
328041,lol
328042,because its a logo of upwork
328043,i hope for some fun
328044,unlimited resources some lawyers are gonna have fun with that one
328045,seems like a pretty standard trademark law issue to me doubt anything close to unlimited resources will be needed its not some exotic crypto related legal matter where no framework or precedents exist comes probably down to the question whether up is specific enough to protect as a trademark and the similarity of the colors and shapes used
328046,bullish for ivans bags
328047,with trademarks you lose them if you dont try to enforce thembasically upwork does not actually care if they win or lose or if it goes to dispute and the guy uses it anywaythey just need to actively try to push it even just with one email because if they dont its considered abandonment of their trademark and they will lose itnot legal advice
328048,writing up upside down and in red might make more sense in the current climate anyway
328049,nb
328050,also there is not really any need to fight anything its just a scare letter no need to accept it just print dem hats
328051,
328052,having been involved in a trademark dispute myself it also depends totally on the trademark jurisdictions of each registered company
328053,hey guys
328054,can anyone recommend to stake on solidly or solidex
328055,providing liq on solidly and then staking the lp tokens on solidex appears to be what most people are doing nfa dyor etc etc
328056,
328057,
328058,rip
328059,how are people still letting this scammer near their projects crypto really is fishbrain
328060,
328064,if you deposit more in an existing pool on solidly make sure you claim before not mentoined you will lose your solidly rewards
328065,wouaww any tracker regarding the number of reward burnt like that
328066,shouldnt be too high as solidex doesnt have that issue
328067,i lost the rewards of the first night with that
328068,good to know i am just using solidex
328069,quick question on solidex as their docs are incomplete does the boost depend on me locking something or is it the protocol boost i mean should i do something
328070,the protocol boosts to max but takes 15 of your solid yield instead it returns you 1 native sex token for every 42069 solid you earn
328071,so to make it clear i cant do shit about it thanks
328072,just deposit and you earn boosted rewards you dont need to do anything
328073,ki young ju  twitteropensea got hacked again other than email phishingsome expensive nfts were traded at an almost free price in opensea the victims said they didnt list them in opensea but the transaction says it interacted with opensea contractthe hacker is cashing out via tornadocashsohwak_official1 trace the opensea s suspicious nft tradingsrecently some nft owners have claimed that their nfts have been extortedi examined these transactions found some suspicious patterns so created related dashboard on duneanalytics
328074,letsgoo
328075,cant believe it hope all your lob nft are safu
328076,ivangbis are
328077,strongest hands
328078,wtf why always os
328079,opensea is not going to be the main marketplace for much longer
328080,
328081,quick question if i want to buy something from opensea then where should i log in or thus connecting your wallet in opensea wont have any problem account might be compromise or something
328082,just connecting is not a problem though read through any tx you are signing
328083,you can use also aggregators like gem xyz
328084,tnx for this information
328085,impermax seems to have 0 deposits yet to borrow or am i blind
328087,still there did you find a solution
328089,pretty clearly written by someone unfamiliar with fantom no mention of spiritswap
328090,also if youre farming solidly you should lock up some solid and vote for the pool youre staked into youll get the pools native tokens as rewards
328091,which you can then relock to increase your lp position
328092,is there anything cool upcoming
328093,lido for polygon
328094,sunday tomorrow
328096,swapped 500 sex to usdc on solidly with 2 slippage and ended with a 90 loss nearly 10k can someone please tell me how i can prevent this from happening again
328097,its trustworthy
328098,ftmusdc liquidity is low on solidly use spooky for that pair
328099,the last address must be trc20 not erc20 i guess
328100,yes i replied to them but this whole thing it seems may take forever
328101,sex isnt on spooky last i checked
328102,swap sex to ftm on solidly then ftm to usdc on spooky is what i mean
328103,yes correct
328104,also slippage is not price impact you suffered price impact due to low liquidity
328105,didnt we agree to keep politics especially the ongoing war out of here id assume collecting donations for either side is included in that also why donate to the armed forces the money is better spent on organizations that exclusively focus on helping the civiliansvictims
328107,you should always check a dex aggregator first before using any individual dex be that solidly spooky or any other for fantom theres firebird and paraswap who integrated a handful of dexes alongside solidlyparaswap doesnt collect a fee iirc while firebird is charging 005 in my experience the firebird quote is better most of the time even after the fee is applied
328108,come to solidex tg channelwell help you therefor now we advise you to do only direct swaps on solidly beware of swaps going through multiple tokens
328109,feel free to share credible charities which do that
328112,there seem to be many popping up and despite many likely having good intentions many are also scams reaping the sorrows of the situation would ask everyone to triple check and share in your friends networks instead
328113,do i understand correctly that when a certain supply is reached the protocol plans to switch to a system with a fixed percentage of inflation not for vestakessolidly
328114,sorry for that mate liquidity was too low apparently
328117,yep join the official telegram ethereum rio 1120th march 2022
328119,
328121,hold for news regarding this from the block
328123,
328130,ok now let s keep this for twitter no politics in lobster even when it happens on ethereum imo ivangbi
328131,yes please dont overdo it redacted this is too much now
328135,ivan u deleted the wrong thing it was confirmed one post above
328138,we literally have a chance to show crypto can bring good instead of giving ammo to people saying its only used to evade sanctions
328142,u see what this is leading to ok post again one last time banteg
328143,and then all of it after that is fully redacted
328144,okay here are the official donation addresses for ukraine please consider donating
328147,how are you guys dealing with this
328148,this is only for the next weekly period right
328149,solidly think tank venft locks prevent dilutionas i understand it weekly emissions are inversely correlated with locked solid via venftso 0 locked 2m solid per week50 locked 1m solid per week and so onhow exactly is the solid one has locked in their venft protected is the difference allocated proportionally to lockers on a weekly basisfor example week 2 rolls around and 50 is locked so global pool emissions are 1m and the other 1m is distributed proportionally to lockers
328150,sounds like youve already got a tx with the same nonce try bumping your gas price by another 10
328151,is this wallet shared between devices
328152,nope
328153,this was my first txn and its again rejected
328154,underpricedgas
328155,which is the best amm or aggregator to swap ftm to frax
328156,swap went through in spookyswap
328158,im using firebird
328201,wow
328216,a product launch is considered successful if an issue in lobster daily is dedicated to you
328217,lobster daily 314 daily recap february 25solidly launch on fantom1 helping to sort out some bugs on solidly if you face the same issues dont panic its likely ui bugslink to discussion link to discussion link to discussion 2 solidly effectlaunch on fantom did a decent noiselink link to discussion link to discussion link to discussion 3 you can track solidly on defilamalink link to discussion 4 which issues are rpc relatedlink5 with the launch of solidly it feels like good old dayslink6 is there any liquidity for the actual solid token somewherelink to discussion
328219,theres 393 mil liquidity in fraxusdc pair on solid so just go to usdc first if you want either way itll be low slippage to frax when routing
328222,nan
328223,thanks this is helpful
328225,what is difference between stable volatile in solidly exchange liquidity
328226,thanks for the recapwe are working on some visuals that will help solidly usersthanks to rektdiomedes for this one
328227,biggest problem i am seeing helping people get in is not having a zap feature on solidex that just gets them into the pool they want
328228,ie someone has ftm and wants wftmtomb
328229,devs have been notified about that yep
328230,i am talking about this
328231,if you were doing stable pairs stable usdcmim sayif doing wftmrdl you want volatile they are volatile pairs
328232,ahh got it
328233,what day of the week do emission vote take effect
328234,not an aggregator but best liquidity seems to be on spirit swap
328235,solidly actually
328236,spirit have 65m
328238,y sqrt27 a3 b x2 27 a b3 x22 108 x12 27 a3 b x2 27 a b3 x2133 213 x 213 x3sqrt27 a3 b x2 27 a b3 x22 108 x12 27 a3 b x2 27 a b3 x213did andrecronje end up using this formula for stable swaps samm pairs on solidly or was this just a twitter memejoke
328241,this idk why it got deleted when i said it earlier but theres a true increasing need of decentralized bridgesescrows for it
328242,nobodys business of who you donate to if you dont want to and nobody wants staining your portfolio with tornado either
328244,does anybody know whats next for radial rdl
328245,is this just ether scan hiding the addresses its still possible to look up the full details on chain no
328246,its a name of paks project
328247,this is something i didnt fully grasp yet either dont think its fully 50 to the lockers as theoretically theres already 10 mill venft preexisting so dillution is actually just a few instead of 50 for vestakers
328248,i think the idea is that 25 goes to the initial top 25 projects and if they remain max locked 4 years their 25 is maintained no dilution but there are also zero emissions if 100 of the solid is max locked as vesolid so actually how are there any solid emissions at the moment werent the first 25 venfts all max locked for 4 years maybe nickbtts can shed some light
328249,the nfts were locked but 80m solid was minted to the basev1minter contract and counts as circulating supply no more is minted until that 80m has been distro as rewards by my understanding im not a dev
328250,thats the core mechanic
328251,ok so initially the top 25 projects got the equivalent of 20m solid and 60m solid went to the basev1 minter to be emitted
328252,after all 80m has been distro does new solid get minted and emitted weekly assuming 100 is not max locked
328253,sers anyone good with tick data especially when analysing between two exchanges for the same product
328254,what is your issue more specifically are you having problems acquiring the data interpreting the data or something else entirely its a bit of a generic question
328256,actually it was even worse i meant orderbook data a friend sent some guidance so i will try to follow hes advice and see how it goes thanks a lot anyways
328258,bot got stuck on repeat
328259,best of luck
328260,it doubled up on its infinite wisdom pure alpha right there
328261,thank you for this brosorry ivan for the bump
328262,best way to not lose rewards while claiming on solidlysolidex
328263,solidex does not have that problem afaik havent tested it tho
328264,boys when you create a lock for solid as a new venft you can increase your position we are told that the earlier we are to lock our solid the more beneficial it will be as your ratio stays the same undiluted how is that affected when you add to your position in the existing nft
328265,is it averaged out ie if you lock solid in there day 1 and then add the same amount on day 10 your effective input of solid is day 5
328266,can someone explain or is there a reasonable document to do so how votingfee collection works
328270,anyonee know the best way to change avax to ftm
328271,try using rangoexchange dexbridge aggregator
328272,thanks
328273,project rugpulled by their auditors and devs never seen anything this bad project spent a few hundred k on everything else they didusers could only mint 1 at a time which legit killed the sale
328274,confusing
328289,fin
328294,just noticed pulse x having almost 1b sacrificed lmao what if next ada
328295,anyone have experience with coingecko api vs coinmarketcap api
328296,just looking for the best api to do some analysis on coin trends
328297,why would you use anything other thancoingecko
328298,its like asking whos driven a lambo and a mazda here
328299,ive not used either one so instead of trying each out i thought id ask
328300,honestly great approach to responding to questions
328301,ah get coingecko its much better they have some tutorials too
328302,you can use databarai if you want to query
328303,thanks
328304,coingecko has a wider range of datasets higher api limits and more tokens supported
328305,i feel bad for mocking you now
328306,
328307,thanks for the info
328308,coingecko ftw
328309,1
328310,coingecko is better and you can call each api for free as far as i remember
328311,
328312,whats the fdv cmc of solid rn
328313,
328314,darrenlautf blz work ser
328315,sorry bb asked them to look into it
328316,
328317,oulala z wars
328318,they stole 5m from community and ecosystem participants yup very funny joke
328319,whats the tldr andrecronje ser
328320,same for 0xd if the total supply on cg is correct that looks very low cap to me but idk how accurate this is
328322,oxd has actually a marketcap on their website
328323,u know more whats the context of theft in andres tweets above
328324,reaper collected a nft via tvl but hashad no tokennow they created and voted for a pair that nobody owns tokens of besides themselvesbut they raising money atm and selling a token maybe they swap over
328325,aka they rather waste their votes completly then actually vote for something usefulor anything useable at all
328326,well thats legitimate behavior within the rules of the system defined wouldnt call it theft
328328,well they got the nft from their community then just do whatever they want with their nft while even raising money for their token soon with nftits just opposite of a communityecosystem distribution
328329,havent been closely following this but didnt they get the nft for having high tvl regardless of the whole solidly launch thinghavent they never talked about a token and such
328330,to be honest all this veve thingy seems kinda useless for an outsider convex was built on curve usefull stable coin swap platform here its really difficult to understand wtf is this besides experiment
328331,the risk is there for all nft recipients because there is the expectation they are gonna be good actors for solidly and the general ecosystem
328332,the issue here is the only way to rule out bad behaviour which is subjective is antagonistic voting the opportunity cost of that vote is high in terms of emissions to your communityyou and youd miss out on bribesfees also you have the mad theory as a single actor so ideally youd need to coordinate with otherswhich all of sudden looks like a dao right
328333,with the non dilutive aspect of the nft incentives to extract value by all those cash grab teams is high
328334,this
328335,is there anything to mitigate it or am i missing smth
328336,the community can vote against the emissions
328337,with the downside of having no emission vote yourself though
328338,so thats what the negative voting power slide thingy is for nice
328339,hey guys does anyone know when vapr from curve gets deposited is it daily
328340,continuously as trades happen
328341,husd triggering a 11m apr
328342,lol
328343,ah yeah for spikes like this you have to be in the pool when whatever made it spike happens
328344,andre please
328345,understanding question do i have to lock solid only before wednesday emission period to lot get dilluted or does it calculate the dillution blockwise or similar
328346,once per week
328347,oooh shit nice i assumed it was blockdynamic
328348,any gen artists heredm me pls
328349,guys any avax faucet
328350,paradigm
328351,avax testnet faucet if i dont miss wrong
328352,oh im looking for mainnet
328354,send 75 worth of token to avax using the official bridge for avax airdrop
328355,yea but it requires some avax for gas
328356,pretty sure they give you avax
328357,thats why im doing a bridge xd
328358,i have let avax net at 0 and im using bridge ftmavax but now it reuqires a sign 115 lol
328359,dont know any free faucet
328360,i dont sorry try the official avalancheavax chat
328361,dm me your address ill send you some avax
328362,thanks guyz
328365,theyre all at it self promotion during war times maybe we are too cynical
328366,where can i see solidly apy not solidex
328367,you cant would have to calculate by yourself i think
328368,do you know of any pool with great apy
328369,you can see the apy on solidex
328370,you dont need to calculate by yourself
328371,solidex breaks down apy between what comes from solidly and what comes from solidex
328372,anyways i guess its an iterative process and the forks on bsc metis will have better ui
328373,says theyre not accurate tho
328374,i thought there were other pools earning rewards that are not on solidex
328375,aprs have a range because you can get boosted solid if you lock it same as curve
328376,my page shows the pool apr and your personal apr now
328377,do you add factory pools on curve manually
328378,dont think so it should be using the registry
328383,can you check dm please
328385,what do you guys think about how the counterparty to gmx trades is gmx holders and in peak bull treasury probs is net short crypto is there a solution to all this
328386,code 32603 message internal jsonrpc error data code 32000 message header not found stack n code 32603n message internal jsonrpc errorn data n code 32000n message header not foundn n stack error internal jsonrpc errorn
328387,the full error is much longer
328388,please try a different fantom rpc sorry for the spam kind admins
328389,ah cheers sir and yeah sorry for the solidly spam
328391,anyway any place to stake solidex staking tokens
328394,scroll above ctrlf removed
328395,aside why would you ever use a negative error code
328396,much less why 32000
328397,thanks are reaper and byte masons going to be punished for this behavior
328398,considering theyre pretty much as fantom native as it gets im kinda suprised that andre has come out swinging against them folks like the bytemasons are the reason that fantom opera has grown as much as it has bebis was one of the first devs i met when i started working in the space andre himself is also a fantastic dev and the chain owes most of its relevance to him that theyre fighting each other is a shame reasonably speaking the bytemasons are in the middle of a launch and for those of you here who are devs you know the absolute burnout and exhaustion that comes with such to me it sounds like they just couldnt be bothered to deal with solidly this week so set this up as a way to kick the can down the road until the next vote when their own token would be live im suprised that so many are immediately jumping to malice when hanlons razer dictates that this is just a dumb joke that didnt land right complicated by the fact that i dont think many of the teams using solidly right now fully understand the implications of their actions as well as andre does that all said andre is in the middle of a launch too and with all the morons on twitter and in here blaming him for rpc issues he has no control over its no suprise the man is on a hair triggerif they kept farming on a token nobody could buy that would indicate malice but this just seems like a case of frayed nerves exhasuted devs and people jumping to conclusions the rest of the solidly holders could vote to punish them but thatd be a zerosum game for their own emissions so it doesnt make much sense and is unlikley to happen
328399,i read something about andre taking away fantom developer incentives from them is that even possible
328400,sleepy dev strikes again
328401,the foundation is the one who provides those incentives i believe they have full leeway with who gets what so technically yes but the foundation isnt solely andre and bytemasons is frens with them so itd be fairly unlikely
328402,bruh wtf is a require statement
328403,
328404,my take is that andre went to lengths to avoid this exact fake pool scenario the downvote system only for it to happen on week 1 which struck a nerve ofc
328405,did upbit just commit kill itself as an exchange with any liquidity
328406,they also have a very trash token with a ido they raised a lot of money and their code is based on yearn a lot of marketing for an autocompounder they did not help the ftm ecosystem beefy was around already they just took part of the pie and raised a culty community that worships bebis for no reason
328409,hi this is actually a topic i am trying to learn more about myself incentives for the fantom ecosystem fund are supposed to be programmatic and based on criteria like tvl they also have a grants program but they have mostly stopped focusing there since announcement of their ecosystem fund and 370m ftm incentives
328411,please dont post tg chats links herejust mention that in your answerlike check in solidex tg chatwhy there are many scam chats with same names and its incredibly hard to check all of them for admins
328412,they have been shit talking andre few times and only achievements they made so far was forking andres protocols nearly losing millions of users funds and releasing their own token
328413,sounds like danieleshit
328415,apart from danielles debacle teams around popsicle and abra actually delivered not forks afaik
328416,abra is a fork
328417,popsicle also didnt really work
328418,my only query was if the teams who operated within the parameters of the code reaper and byte masons but unethically according to some people andre will be punished by a decentralized foundation fantom foundation or andre alone even has the authority to do that or if its just gossipthe decision making process of this is far more consequential than this one incident
328419,they had advertised aprs completely off from reality plus they got hacked
328420,gossip
328421,also a foundation is not decentralized its an entity
328422,i appreciate the clarification thank you
328423,you just created the next fundraise idea for someone a decentralized foundation dao
328424,i think i see why andress upset by this now if every protocol who had received the nft decided to all get together and farm tokens only they have access to it results in a state where theyre the only ones getting solid and the entire goal of this endeavor with the tvl snapshot is rendered pointless goal was to distribute solid to those projects token holders by having those projects vote emissions onto themselves but if one project votes for a nontrading token they get all the solid their nft entitles them to since they own all of its lps and that increases their voting power letting them direct more solid back to themselves may even have elements of a prisoners dilemma in it not sure havent considered the mechanism that thoroughly potentially makes it possible to drain value away from solidly since you arent bringing in any fees value into the protocol but you are taking value out of the system your solid tokens
328425,anything can be done about it
328428,the general situation no its a flaw in the mechanism design nothing for it but to hope there isnt any element of prisoners dilemma bm is kinda a special case since they arent a dao daos arent impacted by this since they are governed by holders who want the solid tokens while also wanting liquidity and demand for their own token this specific case wait and see what happens to the solid tokens they farm if im right and it isnt malicious bm will probably distribute them to the community as lp incentives if they lock them however that would mean something altogether different solid tokens that are locked are nondilutive which means that this first round of emissions will always have more voting power than subsequent ones so if they lock rather than distribute the solid tokens they make from this thatd be more indicative of the unethical behavior andre has ascribed to them
328431,of what exactly
328432,bentobox
328433,its not a fork
328434,its a licensed product
328435,boringcrypto licensed it to them
328436,same difference in the sense they didnt build it themselves
328437,original deployment did not include this tool they added it on top later nvm
328438,this is not a very good take by that logic any licensed software is a fork
328439,i was responding to the context of his question apart from danielles debacle teams around popsicle and abra actually delivered not forks afaik
328440,its a licensed fork the rarest of forks
328441,they delivered a lisence omg
328442,who
328443,p213
328444,bento is a vault still takes execution to get deposits etx
328445,i like the team just saying its not a fork is disengenous
328446,its not a fork its a lork
328447,licensed fork
328448,why do you think all these daos come and try to restructure sushi
328449,hint its not for the love of community etc
328450,its for the ip that is retained to the community
328451,not so they can value extract the carcass
328452,mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
328453,true or false yearns sphere of influence is shifting from ethereum to fantom
328454,social influence perhaps capital still remains mainnet heavy they just deployed to arbitrum though so it might shift to that id argue that when it comes to people using yearn are fairly risk averse so the small increase in price in gas for significant perceived increased chain security vs ftm will mean a lot of people are going to bridge over to arbitrum
328455,plus ftm is unbearably congested atm
328456,based on my observation this group has many technical members wonder is there someone interested in cultural part have you joined some cultural related web3 community and do you think culturebesides technology will be another kernal to drive web3
328457,tech culture isnt culture
328458,good argument but if you mention culture to others its less possible to take tech in consideration
328459,its shitty but at the same time do we want solidex to have an unfathomable lead on ve locks i dont love what bm did but at the same time the competition that will eventually result between solidex and oxdaov2 is good for farmers and users
328460,yes 100 governance structures should also factor in to that theres much more to projects than just tech and much of these other roles are often taken for granted
328462,i dont want to devolve this into nft chat in any way but i typically view the nft communities i am involved with as more about culture
328463,is there anywhere to get a 1000eth flash loan for free these days
328464,not for free you never could do that but you can flash loan on aave and a few other places if you pay the fee
328465,dydx used to be free
328466,have you tried dodo
328467,idk how much eth they have though
328468,nft is more about culture part but defi and any other area should also take culture into consideration the fact is few of them talk about culture do you know the culture of makerdao or is there a podcast about cluture discussion around defi fouders
328469,hello gentshow to mint acquire lobster nft
328470,gm sir you can get one from market please join lobsterdao 3
328471,since culture is pretty hard to define what kind of things do you think defi protocols should be talking aboutconsidering
328472,thanx sirhowever i would like to get it for free in exchange of my contributions etc etc
328473,you can make a proposal for doing some a work for the dao eg making a dashboard bot research or so check out githubcomlobsterdaooverview issues and readme also please write your ideas to lobsterdao good ones are always supported after gov voting
328474,several defi daos ive seen think about their cultures quite a bit sometimes publicly yearn is a good example
328475,hm not sure what to say culture in the sense of we are ethical builders slow a bit but we take security seriously and as such we are very diligent vs we fork stuff and make sure it sticks experimental approach this is culture of building i guess and it influences the brandingbut general culture as in what preferences irl people have their families other views i would say a strong no to debate that the more subjective factors you take into account the more disagreements you will encounter within the group the more potential conflict points you create you start doing code of conduct and all that shit that kills dao vibes makes it too formal and leads to dame type of wannabe tweeting so builder culture and being focus on building cool anything else subjective should be out of the scope and left for people to deal with irl
328477,id agree with that successful cultural wayfinding in daos usually feels more like just memes rich conversation this leading sometimes to art and branding all that supports a coherent working culture often a feeling of belonging and meaning for builders and token holders without needing to define things unnaturally
328478,culture meaning different things based on context we mix up societal culture with organizational culture etc kinda often easy to get in debates coming from different povs imo
328479,ye so organizational structure
328480,yes and no its all v messy especially as we turn organizations decentralized org culture ecosystem wide etc meanwhile its v common for nft peeps to comment but culture nfts which yes true just different
328481,coming from pfps its not culture but pnding jpegs anyway is just brand style not culture most of those people are simple floor trading degens same as defi except instead of finance being open blabla ethos they root for creator ethos
328482,tradeable culture vs culture of traders kinda or more like hyperfinancialization of culture vs culture of hyperfinancialization vs internal culture of finance organizations
328484,sarthakbiswas94 sorry that is an intro wikipedia headline content once u have more depth into tech econ send
328485,can anybody explain this transaction on solidly to me it looks like 15m solid were minted and this was after the initial distribution took place
328486,mostly agree with this daos will descend into a bikeshedding hell that far exceed conventional orgs if they just become talking shops about feelings etc especially since they drop basic management for loose notions of freedom but reaching consensus on shared principles and shared mental models for ways of working which you could call organisational culture is probably more important than daos than elsewhere
328487,
328488,already this compressed
328489,deltaneutral strats yes though i would specify the band as 915 depending on ones definition of sustainable
328490,you can add overlays to increase it to 30 but affects scalability of the strategy
328491,what if you dont hedge
328496,
328497,loool some minecraft plugin from 2012 was using amm curve
328498,in my experience best cultures in organizations arise bottomup as a result of productive work because everyone is having too much fun making money to care about grievances identity politics and other zerosum stuff building something together creates rapport cultural practices are established by people in the trenchesin contrast when an organization tries to push some topdown engineered culture a lot of people are unresponsive because it doesnt fit quite right so then management tries to enforce it through political means hr stuff mandatory trainings etc leading to less productive work and more angst and then its just a vicious cycle
328499,so i agree with ivan on prioritizing building in any form the rest will just come naturally
328500,totally agree think and behave like this or get rugged by hr is how the vast majority of very hierarchical orgs end up daos are far more implicitly bottom up structures imo and have potential to do some really interesting things because of it self organisation and emergence rather than behave like this or else
328501,so what do you think about this
328502,seems theres a mind gap between engineers and artists
328503,there are two conversations about culture happening in parallel
328504,this is more material for nft avenue
328505,defi vs nfts engineers vs artists pfp vs art its all just tiresome jfc
328506,this was the first tx after the epoch change 0000 utc thursday and it triggered the mint of the 15m solid that was due to be farmed this week
328507,thank you for the reply 15m in rewards for the first week i did not know it was that much i read in andres initial post something about 2m per week so i guess that initial idea was changed later in the process
328508,was changed yes
328509,do you happen to know how much this decreases every week of is it just influenced by the increasing percentage of locked tokens
328510,its complex yes
328511,is there anywhere to check the emission schedule
328512,its not totally accurate as no solid is being locked but testnet is running a week ahead
328513,
328520,thanks bruh
328522,
328523,werent emissions supposed to be correlated to the earned trading fees of a given pool or are current high aprs on the solidly pools coming solely from dilution protection of the fantom protocols venfts which are redistributed to their community members via the pools
328528,incentives are correlated to pools with trading fees its based on behaviourpsychology not hard coded if you want to make money you vote for the pools that have volume or bribes
328529,and its getting forks with tweaks on bsc metis and arbitrum
328530,any more details about that
328531,bilidly on bsc zeus on metis cant remember the name of the one building on arbitrum
328532,arbolidly
328533,is it not hermes on metis
328534,do you guys know how i can contact the person who wrote this articlethere are a few points that are incorrect if they wanna revise
328535,u can contact me i am in direct contact with the person
328536,andre mad vanish his twitter and medium no longer there
328537,maybe he needs rest
328538,hermes and starstream financial on metis
328541,nan
328542,what a chad
328543,he has an alt account find yourself
328544,deleting twitter is when you know youve made it
328545,andre deleted himself
328546,let the man rest and detoxone doesnt go afk from social media to be hunted back to be asked about it
328548,yepreleases something awesome or that he clearly states to not ape into 10million entitled pussies dont become trillionaires overnight lots of those people break his balls on every platform disappers for a minute comes back 10x better
328549,hey lobsters does anybody know how to become axie infinity ronin chain validator
328550,i think you need to apply to sky mavis
328552,another quick question on solid which i find no answer for the rewards for vesolid stakers are they accounted for once a week and is this snapshot based or do they accrue per block in other words does it matter if i lock now or an thursday
328553,it s snapshot based not per block
328554,emissions are voted and proportional to circulating supply iirc fees go to lps but if the lps are staked they get solid instead and the groups who use their nft to vote for the pool get the fees
328557,so if you have a token that cannot be traded and you hold one of the initial nfts you just keep voting for your token and get 100 of the solid that your nfts voting power is worth rather than incentivizing people to provide lps to that pool you are instead just able to parasitize solid which you can then dump on the market i dont think thats what going on but it is possible and definitely a flaw in the design
328558,think he just had hope that the biggest protocols within the community would also act in the best interests of the community at large rather than only for themselves
328559,i think it needs coordination though shouldnt be one player shouldering the burden
328560,bebis saying that he had such a limited time to react it was so much hard work pushed onto him and all he could do in that period was deploy 2 tokens to farm it 100 himself thats kinda bullshit there was over a month with the codebase public 2 weeks between nft distribution and emissions starting if he cant figure out how to do more than deploy 2 tokens in 2 weeks well
328561,protocols built as mostly blabla forks with tokens slapped on cant be assumed to be acting in good faith
328562,also lol that bebis greatest contribution is forking yearn and doing an 8 figure raise for said fork
328563,imagine being andre and you have some guy who did a raise using your code moaning about how hard done by he is because you just handed him millions of dollars of free money
328564,this sounds like a circular pain ouch
328565,sounds like daniele
328566,and all he can find time to do in his exceptionally busy schedule is maximize the amount of returns he personally gets in the short term rather than actually trying to do right for the project as whole and thus ecosystem
328567,i can see why hes not super impressed with the whole thing
328568,reasonably speaking he should have only included daos like i said im giving bm the benefit of the doubt that theyll distribute the solid to their community but if we set that conversation aside the mechanism design was effective for daos and teams with live tokens ineffective for all others feel sympathetic to andre realizing you missed a spot on the mechanism design is a terrible feeling especially when that blind spot is driven more by humans than computers
328569,sure but dont say this is andres fault because his system allowed bebis to act like a piece of feces
328570,bebis is still the shitbag here
328571,code is law
328572,i guess its that debate
328573,ser why is ur every comment just off
328574,idk how you do it 1010 tbh
328575,thanks
328576,none of this is andres fault perse but it was a blindspot that allowed this sort of situation to exist what if there are other tokens and protocols out there that got the nft who choose to do this down the line the ones who are daos obviously wont since they want to incentivize their own token but pretending that having a system that encouragesallows negative behavior isnt a flawed system is false its an experiment and we are seeing one of the flaws of that experiment in the possibility of this outcomedoes that mean the experiment will fail no it doesnt especially if the benefit of the doubt turns out to be correctdoes it mean the mechanism was flawed certainly mistakes happen if the system survives its a good system if not we all learned something
328578,its still a solvable problem its still early antagonistic voting has a calculable cost if theres coordination to spread that burden then bad actors can still be deterred
328579,nobody is trying to say anything negative about andre over this were just observing that there is a failing in the mechanism if its possible for a situation like this to exist thats okay it appears to be a minor one and probably wont have any longterm impact
328580,theres a longer term gain for doing so but a a single player runs the risk of an ongoing votewar so it needs at least a majority to support again though this sounds a lot like a dao which was explicitly ruled out
328583,while ignoring that reaper raised over 10m from an yearn fork and bebis was being passive aggressive towards andre for a while now
328584,yeah this is what ive seen a lot since the launch aside from this reaper bs theres a ton of people super butthurt and the gist of it boils down to where is my free money why am i not getting more free money how come its so hard to get this free money
328585,im talking about mysely cannot speak for others
328586,so much entitlement
328588,i just cant escape the irony that 1 month ago this project was going to be launched with daniele as a partnership woo boy that would have been interesting
328589,all the passive agressive comments and hindsight shouldve done this or that armchair talk is very lame to read we risk losing one of the most important builders in the space because of this bs any conversation point you can come up with is because someone brought this system into reality gratitude would go a long way
328590,i hope i dont come off as passive aggressive
328591,i have no respect for bebis
328592,is constructive criticism not allowed and are we really going to lose andre this seems a bit hyperbolic
328593,nah i have no clue who bebis is tbh i never touched fantom just watching from the sidelines feel bad for andre
328594,again i have no criticsm of the guy i just am confused why everyone is so protective of him when he seems perfectly capable of defending himself and doing whatever he wants
328595,as a builder in this space it literally is everything you say or do can and will be used against you
328596,guys pls i just wanna understand how solidly works
328597,absolutely that does suck
328598,isnt that real life free speech exists but only absolute bottom of the barrel idiots exercise it
328599,you have no idea
328600,ive been personally threatened before always a good time
328601,people get wierd during launches and the best part is the worst offenders only have a few hundred dollars in play
328602,nope thats a greedy and entitled community thinking builders are robots there to make you money and not allowed to express their discomfort
328605,thats the reason why the can devs do something meme is so frustrating here are devs that put their heart and soul into building software and entitled people flock in expecting to make a quick buck and have the audacity to ask devs to do something about it
328606,hopr the swiss privacy provider has received over 1m in web3 ecosystem grantsbackers the graph edge node ankr and dusk network
328608,to the preceeding discussion critiquing mechanism design is how we learn i think anyone reading through my comments should be able to see quite apparently that i dont have any negative feelings towards the man whatsoever hes been kind to me as a newer dev in the space and his code has been incredible for getting uni v3 oracles working with my protocol however i also know bebis have met him irl and shared drinks i dont get a malicious feel from the man so when im discussing the flaw in the distribution mechanism im more trying to analyze and understand why two men i respect are in conflict with oneanother the answer is pretty simple andre didnt anticipate this flaw and hes assuming the worst bm didnt anticipate how much in value they were going to be allocated and didnt make their plans clear ahead of time my personal opinion is to give them the benefit of the doubt but i can understand where others are coming from when they dont want to ultimately i think this whole thing is just going to turn out as a blip on solidlys history and the rest of the builders in the space can learn not to include nondaos when considering this distribution method in the future
328609,i thought you offered some reasonable criticism of the protocol which was fair and you got attacked for it
328610,congrats u can finally eat scbuergel
328611,thanks i appreciate that the project itself is quite impressive the flaw was in a component of the distribution mechanic and even then its very recoverable people are very onedge about this
328612,its mostly an inoffensive joke and started from a good place but like other jokes that grows in popularity in this space ppl start using it with different intentions it starts to change the vibe yea
328614,hot take while majority of community is fucking idiotic yes some constructive criticism is healthy devs need to learn that it no longer can just be shipping code and hoping that it works you need community managers pr team if youre becoming a victim of your own success in that people care enough about your shit to get angry its a sign of success behind every death threat is a legitimate concern figure out a structure that protects you from the bullshit noise and gives high signal info immunefi but for all dev coms scale up to match it the days of the solo dev are done yall want to be professionals work like it
328615,i think theres a religion of devs being gods and its true what yall do is magical
328616,behind every death threat is a legitimate concernlol no some of them are just schizos with no legitimate concerns whatsoever
328617,behind most death threats is an entitled tard
328618,theres no victim of their own success there is burned out by the community increasing expectations in what youre doing as soon as you get a bit of traction
328619,care enough about your shit to get angry its a sign of successis that what they care about or is it that theyre working too hard to make money
328620,nobody gives a shit about the tec only the money
328621,the thing is that you can not avoid toxicity once your audience grows big enough no offense to andre but this is one of the things that have to come from within the way this kind of social dynamic works is not going to change overnight or maybe never however builders can try to grow a better mindset like why care what nonames on twitter think about you and your project just do not interact with people who do not approach respectfully there is still enough credit given by people who do
328622,i will be on the unpopular side here but if you want success and many users many by default entitled dumb often for your product the side effects come with that unless some devs are able to build fully b2b backend stuff when they only interact with other devs some dev on the end user side still gets the beatingnot sure i agree w what i wrote anymore
328623,so idk how you can argue with this
328624,oh please builders are humans the space has a systemic issue of greed independent builders are more than ok not every project needs to yield maximized profits
328625,sure thing but then be ok with it being small and if you want it to be bigger take the side effects thats normal
328626,not sure what you mean
328628,still just plain ramen
328629,ser if this is how things worked we wouldnt have the open source ecosystem as it is today and especially in this decentralization first paradigm ownership duties responsibilities and liabilities are shared but even then ppl dont let the builder have a peaceful lifewhat youre refering to is correct in the web2 context we are all trying to leave behind
328630,if you cant deal with the bullshit hire someone who can a protocol takes a village stop thinking that builders are master of all trades yall build sometimes make funny memes you dont have a commmunications degree hire your way out of this problem the world aint gonna change
328631,do ppl want a dao and get tokensor ppl want the builder to start a company and hire employees pick one
328632,daos hire all the time many roles to fill
328633,ill point this out that not taking about andre at all builders can be horrible people too
328634,then let the dao hireand stop attacking the builder
328635,sorry to keep on solidly andre intentionally said no to a dao in this instance
328636,plenty of toxic teams grabbing cash and disappearing into the ether gives us all a bad name but are they our responsibility or are they even responsible for this devs do something mentality that has spread through the community
328637,that also contributes to the problem some people in crypto have been fucked hard by various scams and cashgrabs while that does not excuse their behavior it explains to some extent why it has gotten so bad for every legit builder there are like 100 scammers and cashgrabbers
328639,also consider that if your community is 100 people and just 1 are toxic you have 1 idiot insulting you if its 100k people big you have 1000 people insulting you you get a vocial minority very quicklythe only realistic way to fix this is working on your own mindset you will never be able to control the actual problem of toxic people so you either accept that or building for a lot of people is not for you
328640,but the people funded the cashgrabs
328641,often willingly
328642,the complaints only usually come when they didnt profit like they expected
328643,yes and thats why they dont trust devs as much once they get ripped off once its a cylical problem the question im wondering is do we as builders have any responsibility to do something about the bad actors if for nothing else then our own selfinterest and peace of mind
328644,and this often comes not from reading what the builder says but trying to frontrun opportunities ppl cant distinguish between a dev innovating and someone copy pasting projects because they only care about finding the alpha before others
328645,being surprised there are many cashgrabs and scams in this market when the market knowingly funds them is like being surprised youre unlikely to survive a bullet to the head
328646,whos surprised
328647,you reap what you sow
328648,you can absolutely control the mindset of toxic people in communities by pushing them out fud is contagious but combatting it isnt down to the team or moderators its really something that needs to be encouraged at the user level users are more than happy to help shut it down but often arent empowered with the knowledge to do soin a lot of cases there is not as much transparency as there could be with projects as well as communityteam mods that may not have the best communication skills at the same time a user cant help out if they dont know the answers either if the team doesnt discuss decisions that are made or provide the whyhowetc then it makes it more difficult for anyone else to step in and shut them down
328649,problems1 you assume that you can actually block people on the internet2 you assume those people can be persuaded by rational arguments they are just angry3 again if even you are successful with 99 of the people 1 will be enough to ruin the builders day once the community is big enough
328650,i am not saying we should not combat toxic behavior just that this will never solve the problem its like trying to achieve world peace
328651,its not about being rational or trying to convince them its about making sure everyone else can see that they are irrational and you arent
328652,hm you might be right ser i dont really agree with what i wrote anymore i think charlies reply answers it well if we put that burden on the teams in opensource andres case specifically less so for solans muh funded projects w closed source it must come bottom up from user level
328655,yes agree and one rotten apple spoils the bunch not the builders daya bad influence in the community turns the community against the builder and that over a period of time ruins the builders will
328656,so we need to give users some balls
328657,basically degen citadel users good
328658,consider it a generous label for trying to other a selfinflicted problemits happened in this chat many times where people complain after the fact of getting rekt doing something nobody forced them to do
328659,even if profit driven they test help and take ownership wo bitching
328660,yeah we have the shadowy super coders and the scammer coders and the this coder and the that coderwould love to see ppl talk about community members in that light as well for a change
328661,dumb pleb usersdegen ape usersdumb whalestech whales
328662,we categorize the demand side based on portfolio size ironic
328663,donkey ass monkey keyboard pleb user needs support
328664,imagine such support tickets
328665,i also think discouraging idol worship would go a long way towards people treating others communitydev relations with more respect idol worship really just promotes toxic attitudes and opinions
328666,wouldnt that just be giving attention to cockroaches that its better to ignore with devs theyre prominent and they have power you cant ignore when one goes down a dark path some loser screaming death threats from his mothers basement not worth the spotlight just ban himor are you discussing archetypes
328667,are there any examples of a project using a taxed token to create legitimate innovative products or is it always just shitcoins
328668,no cause they rek aprs instantly with those fat ponzi filled wallets
328669,id argue influencers who cant even write a line of code did more harm to the nft ecosystem in this past year than builders defi a bit less since it requires a higher level of sophistication to influence others the point is builders can do a lot by building yes but ultimately there are other forces that pushes projects into mindshare
328670,more to the point in this instance projects were literally created over night to get the nft hard to believe long term theyll act appropriately always thought those should be excluded but here we are it was a noble thought to reward builders but any time someone gets something for free then theyll be issues
328671,nan
328672,
328674,ok so overall we cant make users not bitch so devs should just ignore and keep healthy echochambers to have their efforts be praised and exercise filter
328675,nan
328676,ask not what the builder can do for you ask what you can do for the builder to make your portfolio grow
328677,id add stop worshipping developersleaders
328678,1
328679,wouldnt that require the worshippers to do more than thinking about how do i make the most amount of money doing the least amount of work
328680,it really would take everyone including the devs themselves to stop idol worship
328681,except the worshipping is coming from outside
328682,for all the talk of community their priority is when will this person make me money
328683,worshipping is whipped up from the builders too not a one way street
328684,there are definitely builders who encourage idol worship and we know exactly who im talking about
328685,danielle is not a builder he is a scammer different
328686,not two months ago
328687,yall mixing builders with influencers some builders become influencers most builders are too socially awkward for that
328688,one can actively be both its true
328689,andre yearn boys zefram 0xngmi curve autists
328690,takes a mix of communication skills technical expertise risk tolerance etc yes
328691,lots of amazing builders like better than most that we know on twitter that dont have twitter or has an account with 100 followers
328692,theres very few ppl that can come up with a good idea and code it as well most projects have an idea guy that pays a team to build it also theres 100x more ppl that can code enough to steal someone elses idea to scam ppl
328693,ive thought about the utility of a list of known sick devs but the problem comes from who gets to determine what is impressive and good and what isnt since everything in here is so anon and easy to cheat on voting
328694,this is also some of the requirementstraits in corporate dev relevangelist jobs to be able to do events etc
328697,this has been a very constructive conversation
328698,thank you
328699,as someone who spends his days reviewing how you construct code id have to agree w strategic reserve theres more selfawareness than i anticipated obviously lobsters are creme de la creme builders but sometimes i look at developers and their work and wonder why i dont just walk dogs for a living
328700,i think looksrare guys could prevent wash trading as they generate merkle tree for trading reward claim what do you think
328701,without wash trading they wouldnt get any rewards to locked staked tokens
328702,1 feature not a bug
328703,thats so bad for token holders
328704,majority of token holders are team and early round buyers so not so much
328705,imo the only way these platforms are going to dethrone opensea is if they start paying creators for exclusivity
328706,whats the point of exclusive noname creator nobody wants to buy
328707,who said no name
328708,nay
328709,pay for large creators to exclusively launch on your platform
328710,how do you gaurantee exclusivity why cant nft owners list their nfts anywhere they want
328711,doesnt work like that in free and openweb
328712,btw come to nft avenue this is wrong chat
328713,does the platform care about how the nft collection does or do they care about fees generated also yes users can go and list it on opensea or other platforms the projects would state that theyre exclusively listing on x they wont bother verifying on opensea yes ill go to nft avenue in a second
328714,
328717,yeah since he paid so much for his venft thats bad no wait
328719,ladles and jellyspoons is there a dapp which will find your staked positions in protocols which dont provide you with a staked token is it even possible
328720,its possible but is more an off chain data analysis service of a wallet transactions closest would be a zerion zapper rotki like tool but depending on how uncommon the contracts you are staking are it may not even show up there are hundreds of one off masterchefs and staking contracts around no chance to keep up w all of them
328721,ye thought it may be a bit of a challenge its happened to me a few times and just now i realised i may have some xpremia to withdraw after i saw them tweet good money in it if someone is able to do it i guess
328723,gm lobsters does anyone have any good articles or threads to read about how to value defi protocols like what metrics to look at etc been struggling with this recently thanks
328724,hi everyone i know solidex is still not audited but how safe is this protocol
328725,this is insightful material from bankless well guest writer evan fisher to be precise
328726,nothing can be assumed safe in defi time tested at best
328727,does someone know where the create bribe button went on the solidlyexchangevote screen _
328728,is there a place one can see russianukrainian crypto buying volume
328729,internet segmentation incoming starting with namecheap
328730,what the actual fuck i mean the braintard level must stop somewhere
328731,thankyou will give this a read
328732,west having its own 5 minutes of hate for russiaon the other hand even though the war in question is not universally popular russians like me are increasingly getting disillusioned with the west
328735,like most issues this is authoritarians versus the people
328738,this is now poltiics end
328739,stop apologizing you will be hated all the same
328740,i get it the issue at hand is political but personal political views are not of interest here
328741,i dont agree or disagree but my view is also not needed so just stopsies thank u
328742,anyway namecheap rugged
328743,yup that part sucks and more and more this shit will continue ofc fk me
328744,we need usable web3 and fast
328745,best i can do is meme coins and ponzis
328746,ok fine we take it
328747,im really really disappointed that the only web3 chat is status and its a total ux disaster
328748,status still going nice
328749,
328750,kyber dmmexchange seems started geoblocking users
328751,namecheap are just idiots this is very misguided
328752,just shows how unreliable web2 is in general
328753,this is outrageous i hope web3 doesnt follow web2 actions
328754,looking for someone from decentraland to discuss partnership with a publicly traded us company anyone have contacts to share
328755,doesnt namecheap own a web3 tld provider namebase
328756,makes it even more absurd
328757,ya they offer hns domains
328759,i can suggest nicru use its services being ukrainian lol more than 10 years
328760,better something like njalla
328761,yeah rucenter is an option
328763,porkbuncom is also ok
328765,njalla
328766,njalla is bae iirc some former piratebay guys
328767,
328768,domain transfer doesnt work for some reason
328769,so nondilution mechanism wont work effectively
328770,are there any otc stablecoin telegram groups for uae
328771,anyone knows a lending protocol with chr collateral
328772,cryptosfo
328773,just went through the same shit sharing here in case it helps someone
328774,namecheap just killed all our domains because the account is registered on my russian id and gave me a week to migrate
328775,with a we know we discriminate against your whole nation and we dont give a fuck kind of wording
328776,might be a good idea to migrate all our it infrastructure to nonrussian ids though if possible
328777,i decided i dont want to roll over and pushed back that they are discriminating against a legal resident of the eu because he happened to be born in a country they dont like they pulled back and said update the info and youre good
328778,proof of address might be enough in this case so just a rental contract or a utility bill would probably do
328779,could become quite the narrative im hoping there are more sane companies than those idiots
328780,so if you guys have another residency or a rental contract or a bank outside russia that can potentially resolve such issues
328781,its a private company with ukrainians in their leadership they can do whatever they want
328791,outrage against namecheap from longtime clients more like its literally a poor pr stunt which will make people never recommend it to anyone
328792,besides russian registrators can take its place
328794,and if icann doesnt like russia then we have mirrorring of dns in place ready to detach from dns root
328795,potentially notinit for the pr
328797,it sanctions are probably the most pointless ones because software and it services are one of russias strongest suits
328799,but not infrasoftware and it still needs hardware
328800,eu will try to sneak in defi kyc during ukraine mess
328801,mark my words
328802,they already did
328805,eu reportedly plans to task new money laundering agency with oversight of crypto link
328807,is this true or fake news
328808,well of course they do
328809,banteg s drawing of prepare for inspection pose comes to mind
328810,the eus market in crypto assets legislation was tabled last month it can be fast tracked now and marked as an emergency there are bigger things to worry about than individual grievances at the moment
328812,i thought they were leaving defi alone for the time being and it mainly applied to cex
328814,the new vasp virtual service asset provider designation is going to apply to custodial and noncustodial wallets defi is technically left undefined but the scope of implementation is not clear yet
328815,the real way to rug governments for this kind of thing is to start trying to get payments in crypto right
328816,if you can buy coffee with shitcoins then they cant do anything as long as everyone acknowledges my eth is ultrasound money governments cant do much except something extreme like blanket outlaw blockchain
328817,
328818,the only way is to create circular economies at pointofsale they can designate your metamask whatever they want only the onoff ramps are legally relevant that is what suzu means by only applying to cex
328819,someone needs to fork square but add liquidity incentives
328820,mom and pops cornerstore can farm shitcoin for integrating payments point of sale app lol
328821,agree
328823,you think this is the first time this shit happens with registrars
328824,yes can vouch for this
328825,if not namecheap depending on your gtld they can revoke it as well
328826,ly for example had domains revoked for being pro lgbt ly is the domain for libya
328827,so you have multiple risks not just nameserver provider risk but gtld risk as well
328828,gandainet is french and highly reliable
328829,eg
328830,what a dumb picture
328831,hey now thats me irl checking lobs instead serving customers at my donut shop
328832,take your damn shoes off the counter
328833,andre really does seem to get it worse than almost anyone in the space its a really strange phenomenon i feel for him must really be tough and to keep resentment at bay for those you are building for is another challenge
328834,over the past few months i designed an erc721 implementation that is scalable and extremely gasefficient for onchain applications with builtin randomized extensions for metadata generationsince this article involves multiple techniques on gas saving and onchain data querying not just purely on nft i think it is nice to share it here with the community and my dear fellow developersa few key points inspired by azukis erc721a erc721psi my implementation also provides batch minting at a fixed gas cost we further optimized the amount of the data written to the storage to achieve a lower minting cost erc721psi solves the scaling issue of erc721a in token transfer and onchain metadata querying in a large batch through the use of bitmaps and the de bruijn sequence erc721psi provides the extension for batch minting tokens with tamperproof onchain randomness at the individual token level while maintaining a constant gas cost with a batch of 10 tokens erc721psi uses 90 less gas than openzepplins erc721enumerable and 20 less gas than erc721a in minting and up to 30 gas savings in firsttime token transfer compared to erc721a in addition erc721psi significantly reduces the cost of burning multiple tokens with close token ids which are 70 and 80 savings compared to erc721a and erc721enumerable respectivelyarticle happy to answer questions and have more discussionsfind me at discord 0xestarriol at personal twitter
328835,nan
328836,nan
328837,from my understanding the antidilution is not effected at all but about 10x more emissions than originally planned on are happening now and until that 100m are emitted so instead of 2m a week its actually 20m a weekso on thursday morning 000000 utc epoch 2 begins and lets say that 80 are lockedinstead of 400k for epoch 2 emissions 2m solid 180 lockedit will actually be 4m emitted in epoch2so i guess the moral of the story is that power farming on solidex particularly early in the native sex pairs due to their own partner vote allocation fuck up and locking what you can before epoch2 will disproportionally set you up for success
328838,nan
328839,was my take as well
328843,dear lobsters any idea how quickly does multichain add crosschain support these days
328844,so whats your play buy and lock sex or farm sex with sex wftm
328845,i think before the next vote i will break my solidsexsolid and wftmsex lps since the solidex native lps apr will fall drasticallylock the solid in my nft lock the sex on solidex single stake the solidsex on solidex roll all solidsex that is farmed from locking sex into the single stake roll all sex farmed from lps and solidsex single stake into sex lock roll all solid farmed from lps and solidsex single stake into my nft
328846,rolling your solid into nft right before the thursday snapshot does not give you much rebase solid
328847,it will preserve my of the supply and that is fine with me
328848,i am betting that 80 of supply will be locked so 20 of nect weeks supply will be emitted
328849,i dont think so say you lock 1s before the thursday you literally get nothing afaik
328850,how will synusdc apr get affected
328851,j0hn u seem very intelligent thanks for always contributing to the groupchat learn a lot from u
328852,i dont think so first of all if you locked 1 second before you couldnt vote second of all until the last second the system wont know total lock and thus couldnt determine next_epoch_emissions
328853,your amount of solid distribution depending on when you lock your nft
328854,thanks i have learned a shitload from lurking in here toosynusdc will come down to the vote allocations
328855,how low u think and when will it cut
328856,check the ve_distsol
328857,not sure this will be the first vote where solidexs partners votes actually go thru and the first time where whales and plebs will have voting power too
328858,ill check it tomorrow getting tired but i add to my venft 34 times a day not super worried
328860,any alternative to namecheap to transfer a domain to for free
328861,lobs still voting for rdl or just all over the place would be cool to see a dashboard of lobs votes
328862,
328863,here we go again
328864,azeem cvx unlocking soon too
328865,i think 100 mil solid was printed and 80 mil isnt lockable right so only 20 mil plus rewards mined this week plus intial liquidity could be locked so the lock will be really low lp farming may still pay much more than taking rebase over the next week
328866,is this a good place to ask radial questions
328867,
328868,when is the emission datetime each week
328869,thursday midnight utc
328870,thank you
328871,does anyone know why casting votes on solidly costs so much gas of course 1 ftm isnt going to break the bank but just curious why it take so much gwei
328872,network cogested
328873,i guess ftm is cheap so that not much optimization has been done solidly itself is complex
328874,whats the 80mil not lockable the initial distribution
328875,voting on solidy 325946 gwei making lp 273663 gwei depositng lp solidex 570339 gwei shrug i guess its not a massive amount of gas more than i expected but im guessing theres a lot more going on in the background that a snapshot vote or something
328876,hello sir john from gate io labs the investment arm of gate exchange can i connect you for business with cap finance
328877,what does it mean practically
328878,anyone know a bridge from btc wbtc on ftm
328879,isnt the ren bridge the way to go
328880,i think even varen exchange might have that avenue there with ren integration and output bridge as fantombut i havent checked their platform in a little while
328882,no comment
328883,lmao
328884,haha wtf
328885,yet
328886,please verify that this is officially russians constantly create fake donation requests to pull back support from ukraine
328887,this account was previously verified by ministers and vitalik too so in this particular case it is real
328888,a government war coin airdrop ok
328889,great than
328893,would be interesting if this becomes the first nationstate coin with gdp over 100byear
328894,ok fun joke but lets end now
328896,i am not sure if i can post it here so if you remove my post please dont ban me i am currently in ukraine situation is super tough any support would be greatly appreciated
328897,where the found will be used or monitored by anyone
328898,i think no one even cares about these questions there are many areas where humanitarian catastrophe happening i assume it will be used to import food and humanitarian goods from poland and other eu countries
328899,dmed you some help that i was asking people around thanks to them
328900,economic analysis of olympusdao i wrote it explains how it accrues value how you can try to value it
328901,above might interest you

328906,not here blz ahboyash in lobsterdao maybe but looks weird
328908,ethcc tickets sold on polygon kek ethereum community conference
328909,looked sus as fuck
328910,the sale started
328911,hi guys does anyone know if solidex has multisig couldnt find any relevant information
328912,what i understood was that the contracts are immutable so no multisig the contracts cannot be changed
328913,so the owner of the contracts is zero address
328914,id have to check the contracts for that
328915,the contracts use the renounceownershipfunction which uses ownablesolfunction renounceownership public virtual onlyowner _transferownershipaddress0
328916,that is about the pinnacle of my solidity knowledge
328917,ok thanks
328918,question is whether it has been called but as far as i can see renounceownership is called after setting parameters configuration for some contracts havent looked at all of them
328919,yeah i didnt check throughly how the function is called
328920,it finished yesterday
328921,according to solidly twitter 2 days ago 68 was locked the higher that gets in the next 36 hours the better locking is
328922,where do yall learn the programming language code do you guys have any good recommendation to learn the basics
328923,search this tg for solidity learn or something of that nature
328924,new dev solidity questionsjust check a few links
328931,ctrlf
328932,may be time for handshake
328933,for the ftm farmers seems like the ultimatenodes rpc is no longer going to be active switch to another one if you are using it i dont have any other details so let us not pollute this chat
328940,there are many fake accounts of andre in twitter report them all as fakesuspiciousdont post them here and dont ask is this real youll be banned here as wellthanks

328944,ethdubai is selling tickets on all popular evm chains as well nothing strange imolobs nft holders have 20 discounts
328945,folks q anyone using oraclize now called provable have a few qs regarding its features if you are in the know would be great if i can dm
328946,does anyone know a domain registrar who accepts crypto
328947,njalla
328949,
328950,thx admin
328951,quick on the draw
328952,
328953,which is weird since price is down nearly 50 in 2 days so more must be in lps and not locked than was 2 days ago
328954,thanks does it support domain transfers and custom dns
328955,
328956,you cant be a registrar and not support transfers
328957,at least not a real one
328958,wym custom dns
328959,custom nameservers hosted dns service that lets you set dns records
328960,i need to set my own records a c mx etc
328961,you can set custom nameservers with njalla
328962,if anyone likes animenftsstaking and finds this concept interest would love any feedback
328963,it will be interesting to see token holders vote on how a show should end based solely on how to increase the value of their token good way to immediately ensure there is a season 2 to prevent bagholding too interesting idea excited to see how it plays out i watched your reveal in denver
328966,nan
328967,dont worry me too
328968,ure not in simp list
328971,the animation is really nice is the idea that people can stake whilst knowing where the plot is going
328972,pretty sure ive seen warnings about people bringing the ukraine topic a while back yet these posts keep coming
328973,or is it more like you can stake to choose which door but you dont know what happens in that door
328974,in other words is it more like collective choose your own adventure or is it genuine feedback on the storyplot
328975,pretty sure the crypto sphere would be better suited to make smart contracts work the world is a complex place
328976,
328977,uniswaps 003 fee is that implemented on the router or the pool
328978,for example when someone trades using 1inch on a pair thats on uniswap does uniswap receive that fee
328979,on the poolthe protocollp receive the fee regardless of the frontend you use
328981,lukkiinsightbtc dm ser
328982,just read it and i love the idea will send u a dm have some ideas for lobster
328983,pretty sure it has now some spices on top tho
328984,
328985,cc mhluongo grats
328986,thats that shit i dont like
328987,this is exactly what i was asking for last year
328990,top podcasts of last month
328996,hi everyone anyone playing with terra ecosystem how do you get native ust
328997,andre twitter is fake
328998,its more like collective choose your own adventure
329000,assuming you can trade it on astroport for luna
329001,most exchanges have direct ramps for luna and ust buy there and send to you wallet
329003,not much feedback other than it is wicked and have voted already did have a question is there any pro con other than the obvious influence for voting either way
329004,which exchanges coinbase and gemini has erc20 only any us exchange has native ust
329005,tyvm ser will have a read
329006,kraken binance
329007,or buy luna ust on uniswap and send it to terra via the terra bridge
329008,not sure about other dexs but total liquidity for solid on solidly is like 65k so prices are volatile doesnt take much to move the needle solidex is locking every minute and handing out synthetic versions
329009,not really any pro and con just depends how the community wants the story to go each door represents a different fate for the main character kek
329010,thx
329011,is the onchain router considered a frontend or part of the protocol
329012,
329013,ren l1
329014,does anyone know of an arbitrum bigquery dataset like the ethereum one or know of plans to build one soon
329015,also interested in it
329016,do you have in mind a defined length for each segment or a total length for the finished work
329017,are they counting the 61 that team owns that hasnt been distributed as part of locked solid
329018,gnu taler an anonymous taxable payment system using modern cryptographyarticle comments
329019,router is developed by uniswap you can interact with the router even if you dont use their frontend but the router doesnt collect any fee
329020,alright cool thanks
329021,
329025,were hoping for the final film to be around 10 min in length it will be a short film and about 34 weeks between each episode production time animation is a lot of hard work but were referencing love death robots shorts as our lengthcontent
329026,thats awesome thanks a lot im super excited about this huge fan of animatrix
329027,
329028,
329029,do you mean the remainder of the 100m that was initially minted that will be used for subsequent week emissions
329030,yeah but is it locked doesnt appear to be and contract is prob going to count that as unlocked
329031,no and yes
329032,it can either be locked or not none of this both sthi
329033,i guess we will find out in less than 48 hours but if i had to guess i would say that it would not count it that or the stats coming from solidlys twitter are incorrect
329034,hi guys is there any reason why stable coins are in 6 decimals
329035,not all stable coinsgusd uses 2 for example
329036,oops dai is 18 decimal just checked
329037,why is tether and usdc 6 decimals
329038,yea just checked why is it so arbitrary
329039,
329040,is there any other common used tokens that are not 18decimal
329041,all the fiatcoins
329042,gastoken is but its not used anymore
329043,btc and ohm
329044,wbtc is isnt it
329045,and u want gohm anyways
329046,just call decimals
329047,
329048,think 6 decimal places is a general bankingfinance standard probably just to follow suit with that
329049,most accounting systems i can recall use that precision
329050,yepp building out a specialized platform to make it easier for devs to build dapps with access to other l1s natively without having to worry about all the crosschain tech themselves
329051,bridge your matics on ethereum if you didnt already because here is the official announcement
329053,how long until you can do anything with stmatic on polygon do i smell a curve pool
329054,huhu stay tuned for integrationsyour smell might be going in the right direction
329055,or wrong i cant tell
329056,anyone got an il calculator want to enter the fxscvxfxs pool by splitting my cvxfxs 7296 in total peg on cvxfxs is 108 per fxs so even distribution too the lp will be 3329 fxs 3643 cvxfxs whats the end result when peg is 11 more fxs and if so are we talking like 3500 3500 each
329057,just check the testnet deployment
329059,its a curve lp if that adds another factor someone is telling me i can just deposit the cvxfxs and leave as is
329060,end result would be more fxs deposit more fxs to slurp the out of balance pool you can deposit in any ratio you want
329061,ok so i already brought the cvx when it was even more out of balance but i wanna work calculations now not just yolo
329062,its an out of balance stable pool mate if you supply fxs pool will arb cvxfxs for u until the peg is restored and add fxs to the pool as u mentioned the imbalance is 8 so expected slurp there should be 8 of your deposit cvxcrvfxs rewards
329063,just add fxs
329066,
329069,tldr the nodes serve as data availability committee only responsible for storing and providing transaction data
329070,
329072,
329073,anyone know what time the release is
329074,anyone know of a list of crypto twitter accounts sorted by followers
329076,admins have already ask to stop politics talk please obey or ivan will spank you
329078,
329079,evmos imo will be huge once credible solidity devs build overfork i like the token distribution being mainly an airdrop for an l1 evm built over cosmos the cosmos ecosystem and ibc will be huge in 22 check your allocation gotrektcom
329080,gotrekt not loading my allo does it work for others i can connect with wallet and the dashboard is just emptyloading
329081,it shows for me chrome
329095,yeah atom stakers get the most as ethermint was originally funded with 100k atoms
329102,
329103,i hope it didnt end up like glmr with 10 dex in the first day launch
329104,based defi enjoyers forwarding a novel question from a fellow degen you might know the answer to
329105,are there apps out there to simulate how much of a price change increase if certain amount of eth is injected into buying up the tokens
329106,follow up question especially if you can change the blockchain and enter the smart contract address for the simulation
329111,this question cant be answered without context which curve model is the dex using for uniswap v2 the answer is xyk for univ3 it depends on liq concentration
329112,i think the question was about an app to perform calculation not that i know of have to query chain and perform calculation and the method would depend on what dex i think coingecko lists the amount of liquidity for 2 or 2 spread per exchange on each pair not sure how delayed or accurate tho
329113,good note i guess it would be best to account for all possibilites ie when the token contract is entered that the app detects the chain or we can pick it ourselves doesnt matter and on which dexes its trading ie whats the situation with the poolsliquidity and then based on that to run the appropriate price simulation if that makes sense
329114,yeah along those lines
329115,i dont know of an existing app but its pretty straight forward to code you d need to get reserve for tokena and tokenb and apply the amm formula for the relevant dex you d need to select the chain yourself as the amm might be deployed on same address on different evm chain
329116,just uniswapv3 might be a bit more complex to handle
329117,thanks for the reply i only wish i were at that level me and code are like vegans and steak just a simple degen wandering the defiverse
329119,right bcs of how differently liq is handled
329120,your assuming this is a direct hop trade
329121,wow and just like that they are simply telling users who locked cream before the cancelled snapshot they will receive 4x less token than promised and like 10 times less if they locked 3 or 4 yearswhat a joke
329122,if you make that assumption and fix slippage rate etc
329123,yes need to account for price impact as well if you want your amount in and not just the impact on token price
329124,blocknative has this functionality
329125,make a few pumps change infos as you likethen scam everyone the cream style
329126,you can do simulated trades on blocknatives platform
329127,yw
329130,meanwhile defi hold my beer
329131,
329132,thanks sir
329133,is there any infra company like infura or alchemy that actually accepts crypto payments
329134,a lot of these companies accept crypto payment for their enterprise plans
329135,weird to do that especially when web2 companies like namecheap or vultr can accept crypto payments for everyone
329136,what network
329137,main net
329138,eth
329139,manifold will be releasing securerpccom later this month you will be able to configure custom rpc endpoints as an example feature
329140,zoomk is an rpc provider right now that accepts crypto
329141,for what its worth moralisio did accept crypto payment for their regular plan when i emailed them about it
329142,moralis
329143,however i am not really happy with moralis
329144,why jc
329145,any rpc endpoints you want
329146,debug_ is available
329147,archive etc
329148,ty buddy
329149,found it slower than most also i was using it for a debug and it suddenly went offline under load which shouldnt happen when you have the paid package
329150,
329151,honestly not sure yet i am just exploring ways i can detect when a new erc721 or erc20 contract is created
329152,
329153,this airdrop will be legend is that first ever an airdrop from an official government
329154,el salvador did a bitcoin airdrop
329155,if you consider that
329156,airdrop btc mean nothing to airdrop a new token
329157,could china buy up the token and do governance attack
329158,maybe its gonna be from a partnered crypto project or something but the collected amount could break all records
329159,donations go brrr
329160,
329161,this war is so much about crypto no matter how unpopular it is to say that
329162,could russia buy up the token and do governance attack
329163,both sides have been preparing for it with crypto as leverage
329164,btc ppl get nothing
329165,lol
329166,defi or ngmi
329167,seeethe
329168,how about galvin
329169,satoshi needs to jump on this nft train to make bitcoin trendy again
329170,if someone is searching for it its at solidlyexchangebribe
329171,attack on what
329172,some degenclueless intern suggested tokenising goodwill kinda gross
329173,from the tweet thread could be their airdrop is just for polkadot could be a suggestion by gavin
329174,fake tg channels probably exist already terrible terrible idea
329175,nothing just a joke that ukraine will make decisions about the war using snapshotorg and holders of their airdropped nfts
329176,biggest brain move is making sure youre in for the polkadot side since whatever it is therell be fewer of them since fewer users
329177,or bigger brain is selling all your assets to russia for cash to bypass personal taxes
329180,is there a standard mobile walletlike how metamask is the standard for polkadot yet
329183,oops pvp
329185,the parity one i think
329186,parity signer
329187,misguided at best
329188,thanks
329189,gotta admit that id feel weird donating now
329190,gavin wood beating jihan wu for the biggest adoption marketing by just using 5 million dollars
329191,imagine they mishandle the distribution or their admin wallet gets exploited defi sillyness becomes a big deal
329192,for stupid reasons
329193,it also just looks really really bad
329194,like i own an nft given to people farming airdrops offered by a wartorn country just doesnt sound like a list i want to be on
329195,you give me attention i give you fake money
329196,well we are going thru the peak of attention economy if this actually ends up maximize their chance of getting donations you cant blame them for doing it the moral and ethical dilemma remains tho
329197,people will farm it people will lose money wtf i hate ukraine now
329198,is there a trick to get bitcoin lightning working i am trying to fund a paywithmoon virtual card with bitcoin but transactions keep failing
329199,if all you care about is donations fair enough maybe its a good idea but airdrop dynamicsmetagames are very simple and well known by individuals people assume and expect more from governments
329200,idk though in general i still dont fully grasp the idea of sending the ukraine goverment money the people yesbut a goverment that continuously gets hundred of millions to handle but now begs for a few mill because apparently they dont have money to help their citizensdont want it to end as a political discussion just in general dont understand why a goverment does this airdrop and all
329201,i am not disagreeing with you just that if donation efficiency is the goal this maybe the best way of incentivizing it
329202,i think many in general would agree with you thats why the nft drop if there is even one cant find any concrete proof that there is going to be on very well could be something thats getting lost in translation can help them approach donations in a gamified manner
329203,i absolutely hate the idea of gamifed moralityvirtue i would rather lose everything on cheese themed scam tokens
329204,i am iffy on it if theres a charity that gives you a little nft badge for donating to a cause like cleaning rivers or taking care of puppies i think theres nothing wrong with giving people a sense of pride and accomplishments but as noted there is a difference between a government doing the same thing especially one thats being massively backed by most major powers
329205,it implies that you can value this things extrinsically in reality you cant churches learned very early to hide their wealth for this reason
329206,yes i totally agree badge good ponzu entry token bad i began this conversation thinking it was a token airdrop rather than an nft
329207,commemorative art is cool
329208,they just said airdrop i assumed nft but tbh there is nothing concrete evidence of it either being an nft or token or even an airdrop to everyone who donated the thread is confusing
329209,it shifts from talking about polkadot to the airdrop
329212,how will they even justify a ponzi token
329213,decentralised war bond
329214,ohm fork to fund war
329216,morality is already gamified at the fabric of society this is just visible so it feels yucky every org incentivises funding in some shape or form
329217,virtue will be signalled the donated org will capitulate on that insight no shame
329218,yeah thats why you get tax benefits when you do charity economic incentives arent new
329219,even for governments
329220,it just feels weird for a government to do jpeg airdrop
329221,but then again government gives out medals for everything this is just medal for the metaverse
329222,such a great take
329223,learn a lot from this insight
329224,gamified morality is a very interesting topic
329225,i am not sure if you are being sarcastic but thanks anyway
329226,i was geniunely inspired by the medal comparison
329227,kinda neat one of the eth etfs in canada accumulated 30k eth in 3 days
329228,they bought the dip
329229,just programatic
329230,a few redemptions in dec ow obvious slope
329231,polkadotjsorgextension is canonical default but its a signer on purpose you cannot expect to send tokens through it send tokens through polkadotjsorgapps by connecting to the chain you are interacting withalternatively use talisman or subwallet
329232,wait parity signer is only a signer damn thought it was a full noncustodial wallet
329233,parity signer is largely unmaintained but the alternative for such a cold wallet on a separate device is stylo
329234,other mobile wallets are mathwallet nova polkawallet fearless these are generally fully fledged metamasklike apps with web3 browsers built in for the polkadot side of web3 i recommend nova
329235,
329236,question why are signers not more common code wise being more minimal should be safer and initiating transactions on a website seem both more intuitive a lot easier to build a decent ux and tokens can be automatically added without causing a security risk
329237,because people are lazy and used to the metamask paradigm of trying to do it all and being rather terrible at all of it signeronly is absolutely the only correct approach
329238,yeah feels like a large part of why mm ux is so bad because they tried doing all the things
329239,phantom seems slightly better but autoadding tokens seems dangerous
329240,if it was on a website with separation of concerns they could do a way better job
329241,especially in a heavily multi chain environment mm is a nightmare to use even with 23 active mockeths like matic ava fantom cannot use two apps on two chains at the same time without lazy devs deferring everything to mm and mm going crazy with switch network nao warnings
329242,a website should provide its rpc connection editable by user and the functionality that it expects a user to interact with nothing more and it should only ask an extension for signatures
329243,yeah agreed same thing a site would just query all networks easy enough summarize everything and offer a consolidated view
329244,polkadotjsorgextension catches a lot of flak for being too minimal but it keeps users ridiculously safe
329245,they seem to have struck a fine balance between being minimal yet still have a shit ux pretty impressive actually
329246,expecting an extension wallet to do everything from sending tokens to showing nfts is as dumb as expecting i dunno oasisapp to let you send dentacoin context matters specificity matters
329247,this is true mainly because all of polkadot spaces js api ui extension everything has a bus factor of 1
329248,is there any major security downsides of website initiated transactions do people get used to just click sign on everything or other issues
329249,no more than websites delegating the signature to a metamasklike wallet same thing if the signer can interpret the message and show what you are signing thats all you need no
329250,yeah thats my thoughts just seems like no one is doing it so figured there might be a good reason
329251,the api of every chains node in dotsama is standardized and exposed via builtin metadata autogeneration so in theory every message submitted to a node is 100 human readable in the signer ui no risk there really
329252,being on a website would also enable having an address book transaction history thats decent etc
329253,that is why kitchen sink mode is with polkadotjsorgapps while the extension is just a signer the same signer you use on something like singularapp to trade and mint nfts but we limit the feature set to just that because that is all we care about cross chain balance assets and crowdloan statuses are raeadable from subid and that is all that site does etc that is how it should work i wish ethspace understood this rather than peppering me with switch network laziness on every new tab i open
329254,i like the unix like philosophy of composable singular function components instead of monolith jack of all trades master of none
329255,hola hola does anyone know any good analytics platforms for terraluna
329256,
329257,flipside crypto is a good start
329258,have you looked at the clover wallet its multi chain and allows you to stay connected to multiple networks which helps with the switching rpc annoyance
329259,clover is abandoned iirc
329260,hello guys does anyone here have contacts with trader joes sec team looking for a way to contact them directly will be glad if someone here can help
329262,unless it was abandoned less than a month ago we recently integrated it into an application i think their narrative changed a lot from layer 1 to wallet
329263,i may be thinking of something else
329264,discord 0xmurloc theres a decent team behind joe
329271,a feature that most of these kind of service is being able to select what kind of node i want to connect to nethermind erigon etc
329277,what is the advantage of your system over pokt how are you handling the sybil problem that infura suffers from
329278,this is interesting though been thinking solidex was danieles too
329279,ok deleted because of bisex and any other sex shitty token promobut your question is legit yes how to knowprove that and not just spamming with gossips here
329280,no worries but what is danieles role in the solidlysolidex play
329282,seems more like rumours without any elements to sustain them
329283,he disappeared
329284,i am not sure why the medium article write this but it makes sense to me as daniele was part of solidly and then vanished while abracadabra joined solidex
329285,daniele is not part of solidex
329286,from what i understand he was pretty busy and i think still is managing all that went down with his own projectsand if not mistaken abra joined solidex pretty late
329287,youre part of solidex team right
329288,lets say im part of the mods
329289,do you actually know for sure the identity of your team partners
329294,enough solidex shill you let them talk of themselves too much meh
329295,read 200 msgs thanks for keeping it clean legends
329296,fucking joe man reading the cryptopians puts this exactly on brand
329297,can i ask if there is any api for token address combinationfor example for aave ohm bas cover fwb there is migration so i need mutiple smart contract address to piece together
329298,hey has anyone ever used dia data and could share some experience with them are they legit as an oracle service
329299,not aware of any project using them considering them
329300,wdym token address combination
329301,doing some adoption analysis so need to combine token txs together
329302,do you know any particular reason why is it a matter of presence in the market or its something with their services
329303,otherwise cant get full data for analysis
329304,fuse is using them
329305,probably best if you speak to the ceo paul claudius happy to connect
329306,just looking for objective opinions
329307,maybe you know anyone from their team that i could contact
329308,fuse or dia
329309,fuse
329310,sure dm me
329311,interesting topicbeing data science big data engineer i used apache spark a lot for analytics with unstructured immutable data userserviceapps tx log recordsbut im in crypto 3 years and cant find any tutorials for using apache spark for blockchain tx analyticswho knows why
329312,what do you mean
329313,if you want to analyze data onchain you can use bigquery or dune
329314,loading all transactions data into parquet files and run jobs for any question
329315,i think there should be a lot of company doing this already just inhouse
329316,yep probably btw i think you are right about bigquery its closing most of tasks for bi
329317,well i mean google offer free onchain analysis for bigquery they already load eth data into bigquery
329318,and can use it for free
329319,another option is dune which is also free and a lot better imo
329320,yeah the only issue they both re mostly ethonly atm afaik
329321,i think dune offer bsc and solana data now
329322,checked docs now raw data supported foreth xdai solana
329323,
329324,is that how the story ended
329325,was thinking team tokens unlocked or smth
329326,celo kinda pivoted their whole narrative from unbanked to defi ponzis tho
329327,cos africa and latam play didnt work out its hard
329328,its hard if youre a team from a developed country using those narratives yea
329329,why would you do that
329330,maybe he has a tokenid number that he likes
329332,hows the book
329335,new spiderbatman gauge in town created by the second largest solid whale guess what happens nextthe address had shit loads of 0xdao tokens and been relentlessly swapping them for solid throughout the day
329337,good so far pulls a lot more punches than the infinite machine and theyre all well substantiated you can see the infinite machine suggests some of these things but doesnt explicitly say them eg ming straight up manipulated vitalik as exec in lauras versus camila makes it seem like they were really close friends i think lauras version will become more definitive in the next few yrs as a consequence you need less context to understand what shes saying
329338,agree yet quite a few material details arent disclosed which is understandable once you dig deeply into the origin story and know the key players its a tricky story to tell
329340,is that a non existing token pair i really dont understand what that gives you obviously he earns the emissions himself but still lower then a high volume pool i thinkmaybe theres my issue i think
329342,
329346,this is rooshs wallet
329347,if the address locks its 500k solid for 4 years itd get 2 of emissions for itself so it recoups the invesment is 3 or 4 weeks i think then its just banking in profits thats assuming it doesnt get downvoted
329348,error replacement transaction underpriced
329349,got this error with metamask i couldnt approve any tx could somebody help me to fix it
329350,roosh is ct fantomking
329351,your gasprice is lower than the current base fee
329352,yes
329353,btw plebs this acc is fake fyi not kul
329355,my base fees is 140 with current 70 gasprice now
329356,is this comparable to what bm and bebis did few days ago
329357,exact same thing
329358,except he earned his solid so this is fair game i guess
329359,find it on google
329360,but i dont have the way to fix it
329361,if you want you can send me your etherscan tx in the dm so i take a look
329363,when did this channel turn into a solidly support group
329364,just dm
329365,we re just looking for fresh drama ser
329367,byte mason and bebis incentivized their tokens pool for this week emissions
329368,hmm emissions for this week start in about few hours right last i checked their lp on solidly was very low good opportunity there
329370,the fake andre account points to his wallet too are they griefing him roosh is friends with reaper
329371,fucking scam crowd of shitheads
329372,well they did buy every dip to be fair
329373,they also seem to have nearly 9 figures from just buying ftm at its bottom in 2019 gg
329374,why do we even try
329375,hope dies last
329376,last 9 words blz coine_r
329377,
329378,but what stops theoretically everyone from just farming his own non existing tokens apart from it being super stupidor does there come a point where bribes staking rewards voting dead pools
329379,account could be fake but that address is very real
329380,antagonistic voting was added to try and prevent this downvote a pair problem is its expensive to do it and could mean you suffer retaliation unless you coordinate with other voters
329381,ye i know this but also that its super expensive for others to actually do itbut i just dont want to wake up and see 100 different non existing pairs getting votes
329382,negative voting is supposed to prevent this for small holders that is large holders supposedly wouldnt enter into such scheme because it defeats the protocol purpose and fud the very token they own
329383,yeah this is great for solid
329384,i do think oxd and sex should get on top of this and downvote any bad actors of course they could just do their bad acting 1 min before epoch change leaving no reaction time
329385,maybe these folks do want to see solidly fail
329386,imo andre should have followed your advice vfat0 re negative vote system
329387,it mightve worked but there wasnt a lot of time to make the changes
329388,this week going forward the voting should be okay as of tonight or are there still issues
329389,i think that s a question for deridex
329390,are the vote allocations shown in the solidly ui the ones of the present week or the ones of the upcoming week if its the latter is there a way to see the vote allocations of the present week
329391,its neither its showing you the current vote allocation at that moment
329392,votes can be changed at any time
329393,can change vote last second before thursday 0000 utc
329394,if votes can change anytime how does bribing make sense
329395,it doesnt unfortunately
329396,it doesnt
329397,there will be external bribing systems soonish though
329398,why is there a column titled bribes then d
329399,it works but it s flawed
329400,so do rewards allocated to the different pools change continually then in real time or is there a snapshot of votes which sets the rewards for one week
329401,this sounds like a snapshot eg
329402,snapshot yes
329403,hm but if theres a snapshot whats the problem with bribes then
329404,bribes are continuous over 7 days not snapshot based the snapshot is for the amount of solid rewards which are then also continuously emitted over 7 days
329405,so the total amount of solid rewards for the next week is determined via snapshot but the gauges which aim this stream of solid rewards at the different pools can be moved around on a continuous basis
329406,so the amount of solid rewards per block for a specific pool can change at each block
329407,no each gauges allocation for the week is determined by the snapshot right after midnight feel free to dm so we dont pollute the chat
329408,nan
329409,3
329411,4
329412,actually nvm ivan is right
329413,fast smart pleb
329414,ayyyy lmao got it nowdem adhd
329415,i did 2 developer interviews today and figured out that its almost worthless to check dev skills only for defi devsresearchersso tasks like this are helpful to discover how person is thinking and explaining solutionpardon for offtop sirs but hope this was fun
329416,0xdao sure are doing well at botching their launch anyone slightly nervous about using it when it actually does launch im scared
329417,kek
329418,just ask them to center a div with css while you watch
329419,yeah not reassuring after so many delays site goes live then down in like 12min
329420,is this cuck code
329421,nan
329422,1
329423,look at solidex the lack of documentation security infrastructure should make you just as nervous code is shipped with an audit or a bug bounty
329424,can anyone tell me what this curve quoting formula in the solidly code does
329425,i am observing some strange behavior in the solidly stable pools and im wondering if its due to this formula
329427,is this another brain teaser
329429,wasnt there a bug bounty on immunifi
329430,thats a negative as of this moment
329431,i really dont like this type of documentation because it doesnt let me see when it was last updated the amount of gitbooks ive seen with bug bounty audit soon which were last updated 6 months ago
329432,its a good metric to measure intention vs outcome
329433,i think there is a switch on the gitbook options that shows last updated x i have it on all my docs
329434,i see thank you
329435,thank you king
329436,do we know whos auditing it now
329437,i check lobster chat its solidly chat check chat sex and bribes talk i srsly cant take it anymore it is what it is can fantom gang get a room
329438,auditors dont really to be named during the audit period but can confirm they are being audited by reputable firms
329439,too much solidly in here indeed
329440,we should be talking about politics its what ivan would want
329441,lets start some moderation sirs
329445,id like to watch you deploy an erc20 from open zeppelin
329446,any fallback source for an explanation cant reach the article
329447,decentralization
329457,only accepted reaction on which chain sir
329467,18k members love to see everyone here but please dont say hi when joining and just go and contribute research instead low noise high alpha if only
329468,sec scrutinizes nft market over illegal crypto token offerings link archive
329469,icos part 2
329470,as part of its review the sec is seeking information on socalled fractional nfts which involve breaking down the assets into units that can be easily bought and sold said the people who asked not to be named as the probe hasnt been disclosed publicly
329471,surprised pikachu
329472,depends on tap emissions no
329473,
329474,i never dived in fully tbh
329475,the team behind is big brain
329476,well i have no saft so could be a scam
329477,you should do appraisals its fun
329478,will diversify you from stables the time has come ivan
329479,they appraised parallel masterpieces at 100 eth and now they barely sell for 25
329480,pain
329481,do you recommend any bank in europe that is friendly with crypto business
329482,for germany solarisbank seems to not object to crypto from what i have so far gathered also from personal experience
329483,this depends where in europe
329484,i have no preferences any suggestion is welcome
329485,you can also look into
329486,hey i do a little writeup covering recent events in the crypto space news events and things like that to help me stay up to date if anyone finds it helpful
329487,you can try intergiroa little weirdthey just work with eur and only accept sepa transfers but really cryptofriendly
329489,should people be more concerned about how there is too much usdc reliance in crypto
329490,people probably should but we are in a bull market when everyone are more concerned about numba going up only all really interesting things like decentralization arent in focus for most people
329491,its linked with real usd so i dont think its a big problem
329492,yeah i guess that could be why it hasnt seen much attention yet
329493,the problem i see with it now is that with all financial censorship weve seen in the past week i could honestly see usdc censoring moreif governments can pressure everyone on swift to kick out an entire country how hard would it be to pressure the usdc people to blacklist a crucial defi smart contract it just seems like defi is setting itself up to not be that resilient
329494,nan
329495,coming from a regulated industry and having some exposure to aml fatf etc i suspect the usdc model is likely to be the template for us compliant stablecoins going forward
329498,agree been in the discord for a few weeks and talked with medici a bitimho main product from that protocol will be abacus spot its like some sort of nftbased liquidity pool to do arbitragei think is worth to read a bit about that if youre interested in nft price appraisal they had a sybil attack on a cryptopunk appraisal session was a interesting read and case study nft liquidity the abacus spot thingie nft legos use one of abacus products to provide pricing on nft lending protocols for example instead using floor price and such
329500,until they start blacklisting accounts associated with bad thingz russia canada truckers protest etc etc
329502,sorry replied without seeing this
329503,hi sers here is my first writing effort to decode cross chain communication for the masses pragma always open to discussions
329504,solidly first week already over thats why apr reduced a lot
329506,anyone else having issues with pending claims failing
329507,i just setup an alt chat for solidly lets stop spamming here only drama stuff
329508,i am dumb
329509,solidex chat i guess but at least we can refer people to a group and start redacting solidly support no drama message
329510,i am retarded
329512,
329513,namecheap
329514,gandi accepts btc afaik
329519,gandi
329520,gandinet
329521,the wonderful thing in crypto is that you can just hop over with zero cost to fraxdai or some other algorithmically stabilized tokenwill just push the ecosystem to build more resilient tools
329522,ser u wanna do more moderation ok
329523,they seemed to have a good reputation iirc
329524,namecheapcom
329525,also accepts btc the free speech guys
329526,it s a psyops group rich soon
329528,i find it hilariously self aware that tether registered usdt a controversial and censorable asset based on lies and trust in a specific entity which just so happens to be a crime syndicate under the id 1984 on kusamas statemine common good chain
329529,is there any good way to find deleted tweets
329530,google their twitter handle and see if its in the cache
329531,cryptodeleted telegram channel tracks some folks
329532,
329533,i know this group
329534,i remember someone had pointed me to the author of i got a problem and wanted to ask them a question anybody knows who it is
329535,
329536,u guys already shared above but yikes fuck
329537,according to him he did not get rebase so he got fooled by his own greed
329538,
329539,is it not buyable
329540,he will get his emissions thoughbut ye byte mason playbook but this time without a possible end with a token launch or anything
329541,thats the play here
329544,uho too bad lobster tg cached it
329545,its andre
329554,did you get that from nansen nick
329555,wtf is this the super cycle of cringy top signals
329556,
329558,why snapshot asks for ens address when we create a dao there also ens domain of which wallet deployer wallet or ens of token contract address
329559,some more info here
329560,i guess nobody remembers pledgecamp ico she was part of
329561,cringe is ok scamming people out of 19m not ok
329562,it was she is facebook guys sister kind of raise
329563,embarassing watch
329564,i think its alright i quite enjoyed it myself
329565,this video is so cringe
329566,aaand lets end it here thx there is nothing interesting to discuss except an outsider trying to cringe their way into the scene going mainstream will have a ton more instances like this ogs always leave when things get to this level cause they start puking at what their vision has become but vision sometimes changes so there is no right or wrong without context watch it block it or fap on it if you must and move on
329568,
329569,
329570,this is cool
329571,is there somewere an overview of all bridges that are available within the crypto space
329574,
329575,exactly what i need
329576,this is pretty cool sad we didnt sponsor this research maybe philippzentner can do smth w it
329577,made by
329578,they have support for luxe ens names too
329579,wdym luxe ens names
329580,to add on topic
329581,
329582,lmao
329583,rugged
329584,is this some kind of dream when do i wake up
329585,this timeline is unbeatable
329586,best bear mkt
329587,
329589,every time i look into privacy and metamask i find another annoying surprisei hope all you anons are frens with infura and jp morgan i guess
329590,would be cool to see those on a testnet on a separate page
329591,same goes for frame
329592,frame is the new metamask support
329593,didnt test frame yet will do that good idea
329594,delighted this happened should only donate for the right reasons toxic airdrop hunters
329595,nan
329596,as much as i hate to say it it worked look at how much they got before and after
329597,it was a good idea a great one imo
329598,its all about coordination and incentives they understand that
329599,a good idea for what what are they incentivizing
329600,in other news itau a large brazilian bank today fucked up its balance ledger some clients had their balance gone some clients had their balance increased they are as we speak trying to handle it
329601,makes everyone that actually donated look silly
329602,not talking about politics if you dont see whats happening around us i guess no point trying to explain it
329603,also ironic given recent solidly events that this is also something to make drama about let it be
329604,fundraising from speculators to survive an attack on your country is legit imo
329605,apes got farmed fun but you cant argue against here because the cause is justified in case funds are spent well if you argue against this your words are i am not happy i did not get airdrop while trying to help people who are dying you cant win that so they farmed the sheep why i am saying sheep because if you did not expect anything back nothing changed for you in terms of the cause u sought
329606,i dont pity the people that got separated from their money they got what they deserved you should know i rarely do that in this case doesnt mean i think the person doing the separation was sane
329607,then again you get what you ask for so
329608,ye thats basically it indeed any justification will work in this terrible horrible situation even a rug would be
329609,i think its ethically questionable but then again its just another day in crypto
329610,tbh i donated and assumed the airdrop would be a nft
329613,you will get banned for low iq
329614,redacted questions sowwy
329615,bro
329616,go request ur data from consensys
329617,they sent me fookin 3 gigabytes
329618,really so we got proof that consensys is logging rpc requests or what was in those 3gb
329619,fucking god damn lawyers have non disclosure agreement
329620,
329621,here is the request metamask makes to infura
329622,
329623,there is ur proof
329624,
329625,some numbers on the rise of infura we now have more than 15000 registered developers were serving over 6 billion api requests per day and transferring roughly 16 petabytes of data per month says cocchiaro in 2017 alone we relayed transactions that moved more than 7 million ether with almost 9 million more so far in 2018 and most of this growth happened over the second half of 2017
329626,we relayed transactions that moved more than 7 million ether with almost 9 million more so far in 2018
329627,how do u know the value of the transaction without recording it
329628,anyone knows a way to get 500 ropsten eth
329629,hahahahaha
329630,fyi getblockwallet has issues as well sir
329631,by the way this is not as simple as changing rpc provider metamask has several issues within that make it hard to decouple using metamask and reconsturcting the user
329632,eg metamask will use etherscan on any network etherscan supports to verify rpc provider reported state and etherscan
329633,this isnt really a wallet problem is it if you need to query balances you need onchain data metamask could evolve to disable balance checksallow you reroute all balance and gas calculation to a node of your choice but at the end of the day the issues are upstream
329634,sauce please
329635,another example metamask pings its gas service provider via codefi for gas pricing information
329636,another example metaswaps knows all your trades etc as welll as attempted trades
329637,metamask knows when you went to swap something but then cancelled
329638,if you want your wallet to attempt to make transactions without doing any kind of checks you have sufficient balance or the gas fee is correct youll end up burning eth on transactions that fail and moaning about that instead
329639,metamask knows what kind of porn u like
329640,fml
329641,every stage of the process leaks info
329642,your isp knows
329643,infura knows
329644,metamask knows
329645,whats even worse
329646,should metamasks publishing account get compromised and a malicous version of metamask make it to chromes extenstion store for update it will automatically be downloaded by every chrome user and updated
329647,seamlessly
329648,automatically that is chromes default behavior
329649,gm
329650,oof
329651,wen selfbuildable extension from source
329652,but hey guys dont worry eth_sign is getting depreciated because its not safe to use for users lel
329653,check the itau twitter account its a storm of ppl tweeting about their accounts and their social media manager trying to control the mess
329654,do you think theyre frontrunning all users in the same way flashboys did before iex
329655,is that process fully automated i would assume its not instantly published eg big extensions have to upload the update and then there is some sort of delay or review
329656,review is looks good next relevant
329657,but yeah nothing new here if you use other peoples infrastructure they know stuff about you
329658,yes im aware of a bunch of other privacy issues in mm also querying jpgs is pretty annoying ux usually won long way to go for proper privacy now that nation states entered the arena we better catch up quickly though
329659,another quick question on solidly i staked my solid and thought that there would be a reward with the snapshot but my share did not change do you have any idea why
329660,
329661,this is better checkmate zuk family
329662,finally an honest take
329663,bro
329664,yes
329665,no worries sir chrome extensions using manifest v2 will be obsolete by january 2024
329666,oh shit i mean 2023
329667,nan
329668,
329669,ruggggggggged
329670,looks like sifu
329671,to be clear metamask requires v2 cause of how they handle priv keys but i think they are using agoric ses aka realms
329673,
329674,considering that rekts the only serious adblocker ubo brave should end up with more users
329675,thanks for sharingwhy do they send cookies if you use local rpc do they still send analytics via other means other than txs and current block checking they do any other comm
329676,order books soon
329677,
329678,1inch is already an order book p2p is more like a step toward fiat onramp imo
329679,beastlyorion retweeted __just in metamask has blocked ethereum transactions in venezuela citing compliance with laws
329680,little known problem but this is also happening to some extent in other countries i hneed to switch to mobile networks to connect to some web3 websites in sea while theres no issue when i m in europe
329681,kinda interesting how the api keying and other data siphoning means they can block you even with a vpn
329682,i dont think it has anything to do with metamask though it probably depends on the rpc used by the website
329683,maybe but they do block regions
329685,ok can just say it happens ok specific web3 apps only where i am atm cambodia
329686,does the same happen to selfcompiled metamask instances
329687,well i assume geospoofing will solve it or antidetect system eg lstenebriscc with good proxies from 911re but idk who will continue using it after it
329688,they can see even your time zone in browser check out with pixelscannet or fvision
329689,lets see how long it is going to take until they extend this to russia etc
329690,using metamask id be surprised if their userbase is even dented by 001
329691,
329692,good tweet summary os new wallet vpn mm custom network rpcglad it was a default infura thing and not some crazy spy job for mm tracking ip addresses somehow
329693,you are closer to me than i thought geographically vietnam
329694,wen metamask fork default rpc to a decentralized infura already exists token to sustain the network
329695,if youre affected by this which means theyve paired your real ip with an address and consensys bothered youll need more than a vpn
329696,fair i imagine consensys is 1 doing the minimum required by law 2 having enough headaches with the switzerland situation
329697,russia is using vpns for living so i wont expect them to be affected
329698,isnt this the solution to get everyone away from infura dont know much about the details but saw them at ethdenver
329699,why wouldnt they start censoring too if they become relevant enough to be pressured
329700,its a decentralized rpc provider so yes i would think so
329701,youre not connecting to one centralized provider but a network of nodes if i recall correctly
329702,you can also run your node in proxy mode i think this would be most bulletproof solution
329703,really dont understand why more people do not run their own nodes
329704,its incredibly simple its too much effort
329705,no it is so easy and cheap to run something which you need just to submit txs and interact with the network no need for archive queries etc those are all centralized anyway on centralized layers like the graph etc
329706,its easier to just install metamask
329707,it is still more effort than just using someone elses node people will not do it unless the situation forces them to thats just how things work
329708,it is literally downloading an image onto a small computer and plugging it into 12w even a solar panel will do at least it did when i was selling them presynced
329709,yes that s the point it s a strong deterrent and i m pretty sure people in these countries have less of voice than say northern countries
329710,youve lost 99 of people at image
329711,how do i install a picture to run my transactionsinsert math meme
329712,sure but like i said i was selling them presynced and there are other services that do the same still is 500 really too much to pay to have 100 availability to the worlds uncensorable database
329713,for the average person yes
329714,so it is literally plug and play via stuff like avado or whatever that other things was called that they took stuff from and whitelabeled it
329715,yes for most
329716,i refuse to believe that in a world where the avg eth tx is 100 those that use eth will have 500 for lifetime access to it
329717,are you that disconnected from what the average crypto user is or do you mean why not more of us are running their own node
329718,i am quite disconnected but i am also wondering that yes
329719,i might be interested to look into it and play around for fun what are the requirements or do you have a good link to get started
329720,theyre willing to pay that to make money theyre not willing to do that to make an effort
329721,
329722,wouldnt do it even if you paid me
329723,avg user dont give a shiz about decentralization they just wan make it
329724,avg user also not technical
329725,and even if youre willing to make an effort its kinda like onchain voting not visibly worth it
329726,took avg user a while to fully figure out metamask
329727,well i dunno maybe i am in the wrong camp here but if your livelihood depends on metamask and infura and other centralized eth infra so much that it actually hurts when they finally do fuck you spending a week to learn about the basics of having a list of backuo rpc nodes in a text file and what they mean seems like a pretty good investment
329728,if its as easy as clicking download waiting 5 minutes and then pressing an icon and nothing else yeah probably changes
329729,sure they will react if they need to but until then metamask good enuff
329730,but sync a b and c nah
329731,will leave this tool here for those who are migrating from it rn sweeposauruscom
329732,hi anybody know what a metamask alternative is
329733,frame
329734,apparently being talked about here already
329735,there are several great alternatives mentioned also check out linked defiprime list from op post
329736,how private is it if you run your own node you would be the only one doing txs from it no and depending on how you host it it will make you very identifiable not
329737,thank you
329738,you can run nodes with a proxy
329739,and i think the other stuff is all configurable within your chosen client
329740,mostly because it adds moving parts you have to maintain and upgrade over time for a civilian use its probably overkilled and error prone
329741,there is also that
329742,kinda like how companies dont run their servers anymore
329743,running nodes for multiple chains in a fault tolerant way is a big extra work
329744,but it is good that there is an option and there is a market for rpc providers
329745,i think having a choice is the important thing
329746,nobody hosts stuff themselves anymorethe culture of people doing things themselves has definitely disappeared over the years
329747,this is true will look into what you said below
329748,pokt at least incentivizes people to run their own nodes otherwise its hard to get people to when rpc providers are generally plug and play
329749,yeah but with multiple providers its a relaively low risk if they are in different legal spaces
329750,if it is all infura that is bad
329751,alchemy even has a walkthrough for using them in lieu of infura
329752,they are all in the us so you are not derisking your compliance
329753,but as long as metamask is bundled with it might be hard to get people to move
329754,ahem an api key identifies you in ways similar to infura
329755,its an example of another provider making an infura offramp guide
329756,for better decentralization people running their own nodes is best but nonus entities that make it easy to switch may also make a dent
329757,other options the best place to hide a tree is in a forest
329759,wen ur first mention on techcrunch is smh
329760,lmfaooo
329761,win
329762,nan
329763,tbt to 0xchad
329764,i am sorry but you are our child charlie_eth call us daddy
329765,is there such thing as a multisig which instead of needing all a majority of a participants to sign it just doesnt execute for 24 hours and allows a member to veto its execution instead of having to be signed
329766,ah yes optimistic governance or whatever it was called vshvsh u implemented it or someone else i forgot
329767,ive seen a lot of people complaining how tiresome it is getting participants to sign a lot of the time it feels like it just makes more sense
329768,ivangbi
329769,i know 1 2 projects that work on more advanced governance policies social recovery think its very much needed as simple multisig isnt functional for daos where accessexecution rights should be more granular not in prod afaik though
329770,that was exactly my thinking process no joke its like calling a cleaner a executive health maintaince officer
329771,new name tag for u blz
329772,if no one will suggest you a toolservice try using a combination between githubcomethereumalarmclockethereumalarmclock and githubcomjackbekketescrowethblobmastercontractsescrowadvansedsol with gnosis or special services like safientio if youll find a better solution please reply to this message with it sir3
329773,narrative bldr
329774,can i have a link for main defi chat group
329775,if this is not a troll then ouch ser this is the main one
329776,yep the implementation we made at lido for this is called easy track but its tailored to our dao on aragon currently im not aware of any module you can use to do something similar with like gnosis safe but that would be awesome
329777,brutal customer review
329779,very proud
329781,gnosis safe has tx guards which could be utilized for that but tbh i havent seen any in action personally
329782,
329783,we are based out of st lucia so no us jurisdiction issues
329784,your tx wont be arbitraged unless your using the sushiswap frontend incase your wondering it uses a different endpoint for that
329785,i hate current web3
329786,nan
329787,wen web11
329788,reminder pancakeswap will start geoblocking users from 10 countries on march 9
329789,wow really source please
329790,there are some other articles on this as well but i wonder how they managed to do it so quietly noone noticed
329791,fuckers i will make sure to dump every bnb i farm
329792,our free crypto world collapsing so sad
329793,the list of crypto platforms that we should avoid since they started geofencing users i will regularly update the listmetamaskinfuraopenseapancakeswap
329794,tbf they could come up with something like we had to block frontend for our legal policy but here is the alternative frontend made by community members thats fucking it
329795,cuba sudan the democratic republic of congo zimbabwe belarus syria iraq crimea and belarus im going to guess one of these mentions of belarus is meant to be russiaedit article writer did not include north korea nor iran very poorly written article as the screenshot below lists the countries
329798,they banned to name it russia i guess
329799,how to avoid metamask sister
329800,good question
329801,liquity is a really good example of this theres so many different front ends that it makes it censorship resistant
329802,i guess we can avoid infura and thats about it its still main wallet and its kinda retarded to have it main wallet since 2016 lol
329803,see this use the search its very helpful
329804,and it still offers bad user experience
329805,yes but its the job of the project team to educate community about it
329806,frontend solutions will be very important
329807,
329808,show me single tweet they even warned their users
329809,thanks ill read it i use 10 different wallets but still need to dig deeper to figure out which one is the best main alternative to mm i get the rpc part
329810,yup no warning for the world to see only these
329817,admin ban
329818,maybe just use brave its a privacy browser chromium with ethereum wallet included you can add custom rpc ive been using pokt network rpc for about a week hasnt gone down yet
329819,brave tracks you too there model is advertising
329820,you can disable
329821,i dont like the idea of wallet being embedded within browser only
329822,coinbase wallet is nice the browser extension is just a qr code that you scan from ur phone
329823,it does not use coinbase exchange
329824,whenever u want to sign tx u scan from ur phone as opposed to having it on your computer
329827,yeah its a drawback but if youre looking to get away from mm you can kill 2 birds with one stone with this config
329828,thats actually pretty nice ive avoided coinbase because im distrustfultrust is decent on mobile but the browser is shit been piloting imtoken for the browser so far so good
329829,can we throw in 1inch and dydx
329832,i heard that devs having hard times implementing software with coinbase wallet
329836,they have entirely reworked their sdk from walletlink to coinbasesdk as of last week
329837,it should be easier to work with
329838,i mean even this retarded move has pretty much opposide effect does anyone know can handshake be block the same way and whats the most userfriendly yet uncensored way to use ens name for regular plebs ens gateway can do the same thing technically like who cares how decentrazlied your web3 domain name if web2 gateway block it based on nationality
329839,crazy and with namecheap recently buying out namebase i wonder how the future of handshake domains will be affected
329840,
329841,does anyone have duna analytics for block usdc addresse volume we calced for usdt and it was more than 350m for ethereum alone excluding all other sidechains so its 5 of all usdt are seized
329842,this omg they are geo blocking lets avoid them is a bit of a weird narrative now where have you been in the past defi year the geo blocking making sign a disclaimer w ur wallet have been a thing for a long time gradually projects open source their uis so you could even circumvent that and run your own or they dont force ip blocking while letting you soft consent to some random disclaimers they also cant openly say hey go use this illegal frontend obviously just have a bit of brains to research that now its fundamentally different if its on the lower level of infura but the rest holds same
329843,virtue signalling at its best
329844,ser i think its bad that you are diminishing the importance of the problem i would be in real trouble for millions of people right now i myself alone have close to a hundred requests from acquaintances of how to buy stablecoin in russia and keep it securely i can only imagine how many technically uneducated newcomers joining stablecoin marketing right now people who last week didnt even know this word as for the solution i think its important to split wallets into two categories one that gives an easy way around avoid geo blocking and one that dont matemask both browser plugin and mobile app have simple settings to edit rpc addresses so its very easy to put a new one trust wallet on other hand does not
329845,flashbots rpc any good
329846,it does the things its supposed to do
329847,dont know will set it up and give it a try
329848,
329849,sure that seems fair i meant more in the context of defi and more complex solutions where id expect users to have more brains in other context for the really retail ye likely more us friendly stuff and that will also be made an opportunity anyway i am not disagreeing with you per se
329850,does blankwallet provide a solution to this didnt dig into it but if its all about privacy id like to believe it covers all the edge cases no
329851,
329852,past issue
329854,the stuck tx fix on this one is kinda inconvenient aside from api sushirelay comv1 are there other suggested noncensored rpcs for regular users
329855,question really is will people flock over to a decentralized solution like looks never quite understood the fascination with os anyway and wouldnt mosteveryone be able to circumvent using nft agregators geniegem
329856,how is looks decentralized in any way though only because they airdropped a few tokens doesnt make them decentralized especially if they hold the big share of the tokens
329857,in the jurisdiction sense team is anon there is no legal entity behind it to coerce
329859,the default is powerful primitive ser opensea is how most people get introduced to nfts
329860,sryyyyy addmin
329861,didnt read the definition all the way
329862,ethermineorg
329863,sushirelay connects to it however it is a flashbots endpoint so ur tx night get rejected
329864,whats the best dex agg with mev protected trades and charges fees in tokensnot eth
329865,sushirelay also services the frontend for sushiswap so it exposes all the necessary rpc methods for a dapp to function
329866,gasless trading
329867,yes already using cowswap but need an alternative
329868,what is there to setup
329870,matcha offers this on certain pairs
329871,or certain amounts forget
329872,sushi router upgrade has this feature but not deployed yet
329873,couldnt you just use flashbot rpc with matcha1inchparaswap
329874,its not gasless
329875,also cowswap should be doing exactly what you are asking it there are bids
329876,blocked usdt isnt sanctions only its more malware and hacks
329877,true on matcha if you use wethover 5k is can be gassless on some pairs
329878,hmm so theres no good alternative to cowswap atm
329879,you can vouch for all 500 wallets i dont think so its only matter of time until it would be based on nationality and other political bs imho money shouldnt be controll by goverments at all some sort of decentralized universal thing like water too big to be influenced by individual goverments
329880,yes
329881,the ofac list of banned addresses is only 21 eth addresses
329882,fincen has yet to request blocking of usdt i think that i am not sure of
329884,here
329885,usdt banned addeess
329886,oh right sorry since usdt hasnt banned the sanction list yet that means it would never happen no risk whatsoever my apology for being so shortsighted i didnt claim they banned based on political reasons yet i wrote that 350m of assets is seized they can do it in a matter of seconds with the current trend that even wallets dex etc restricted their access based on regulator requests its only a matter of time until centralized stablecoins will follow
329887,built you this
329890,nan
329891,thanks really appreaciate so only 24m on ethereum any thoughts on why is it 12x lower than usdt
329892,no idea not sure if there are other methods of banning i used topic blacklisted called by usdc blacklister only has calls for 25 addresses on eth
329894,i use it fwiw
329895,havent had any major issues with hanging txs or anything if thats what youre worried about
329896,anyone know about this want to know their actual implementation
329898,its probably because defi exploiters in the early days cashed out to usdt and the team was fast in freezing if youre really interested id suggest you research how much of that frozen usdt was frozen from hackers
329899,the evmos airdrop evm compatible chain on cosmos is already claimable looks like there are some issues though with the frontendyou can claim 50 of your evmos drop by voting for the government proposal and staking tokens1 go to its a community frontend feel free to double check in the official evmos discord2 connect your metamask3 navigate to governance airdrop claim mission vote 4 go back to main dashboard and you should have received 25 of your airdrop5 you need to stake to get another 25 of the airdrop6 we are running a validator so if you have no preferred validator id be happy if you could stake with us at danku_zone w daicafter you staked you will have the other 25 in your dashboard available
329900,i understand your point of you but this is not limited geofencing due to securities issue or censuring few smart contract pairs securities on the frontend what is happening now has wide implications greatly affects ordinary users for example opensea is a centralized platform but we have to be prepared that just like theyve blocked iranian or russian artists and buyers they will one day block chinese or indian if the govt says so or hints so and just like they are blocking the whole countries they may go after individuals as well with blocking or seizing and i am not talking war here there may be situations like divorce investigation ppl unaware of proximity of tainted coins etc crypto world will be split in two very soon i hope that this will wake up developers of blue chip projects to start thinking about best practices when it comes to frontends decentralizing governance and code updates asap that ethereum community will decide to not impose infra by default on their platforms work on improving decentralized infrastructure it seems now that we were not prepared for this as the development of different parts of the web3 puzzle was not going hand in hand
329901,this is all totally true open source uis open source everything and make more users learn of it once they start experiencing issues its natural indeed always a private side of any industry and a fully public compliant one
329902,here some more stats on usdcusdt bans
329903,is it only applicable to metamask since keplr fails to vote right now
329904,i think so for the keplr part you need to send or receive an ibc transaction to get 25 of your airdropyou can do that by fe switching to osmosis in keplr create a new ibc transfer channel204 for osmosis token and send 00x osmo to evmos this will unlock 25 of your airdrop in keplr
329905,the official claiming page is still broken
329907,hey degens is there any platform works like manager present the idea ie btcatom 3x long user deposit fund to vaultmanager does trading with their strategyprompted and once position is closed it divides rewards
329908,so what exactly do you want social trading
329909,this can be done w gearbox fi u wanna build it and get lemme know
329910,otherwise indexes can handle this somewhat but not sure how optimized
329911,they are more passive and not really social trading not sure they fit
329912,theres a project called trading strategy that aims to do something similar but they wont be live until late 2022 probably
329913,basically yearn for active strats
329914,anyone else still using ambire wallet imo best stable yield right now around 2425 when you hold lobster only drawback you get paid in their token
329915,that worked thanks for those who cannot find ibc transfer button go to keplr settings and switch it on
329916,wow lolwhy did i waste tons claiming before
329917,how would building strategies work on gearbox exploring use cases for a team of top tradfi quants with profitable strats
329918,can be done differently could you maybe suggest a concrete one
329919,cool eth denver talk i am guessing its similar to auth3s metamirror product where offchain data is stored and computed in parcel a privacypreserving blockchain storage and computation infrastructure developed by oasis labs
329920,sure example 1 basis trade 2 longonly basket with some hedged exposures where possible
329921,this is kind of like dhedge but with dhegde you subscribe to existing fund managers and get to see how they manage their positions transparently
329922,yeah but dhedge still not supporting perp
329923,when was the last time the gas was so low
329924,you can probably do this with enzymefinance by submitting a feature request
329925,
329926,i see thanks for the answers
329927,thanks for question with gearbox developing strategies is very simple1 write you strategy for example you want to short eth and invest in usdc on yearn it could be something provide 1 eth get x4 leverage youll have 4eth swap 4eth to 12k usdc deposit 12k usdc into yearn2 then you can do these steps using gearbox interface3 if youre interested to implement it programmatic gearbox has adapters special smart contacts which have them same programming interface as original contacts you wanna use for example uniswap v3 or yearn so to solidity pseudo code would be something like that creditmanageropencreditaccount1eth x4 to get 4eth univ2adapterswapexacttokensfortokens4eth to get 12k usdc yearnadapterdeposit12k usdc to deposit usdc to yusdc pls connect dev chat on discord if you need more help
329928,oxmikko sweet thanks we will follow up later
329929,
329930,interesting
329931,are perprelated strategies also possible via gearbox such as basis trading as someone mentioned above
329932,you mean whitelisting perpetual protocol for instance and then doing the strats or smth else if yes then technically possible but requires some more oracle work
329933,not yet but integrations will go brr soon so maybe within a couple of months
329934,oh thanks do u know which perps dydx wont be possible as far as i know
329935,that is probably impossible ye too hard tech wise oxmikko correct me if wrong
329936,keplr will not work with ledger in this instance for now
329937,no im not like that if you read further i explained my opinion why im avoiding them its about the attitude they have chosen simply inform your users they didnt even tweet about this geoblocking and educate community in a way so they or the project team anonymously create the frontend themselves this is my position
329938,perpetual protocol should work tongnk yes
329939,its an interesting subject how should we call anonduplicates of geofenced frontends how to know if they are legit and not phishing fronts maybe we should start brainstorming this as we need duplicatefronts asap
329940,have the core trusted members audit and release an os version then compare all changes if anyone makes with it if you wanna run locally and then the hash ok any other ui can crosscheck if your source code is same
329941,oxmikko what was ur idea i forget
329942,he going full monty
329943,thats exactly why i had that opinon project team themselves should come with solution if they believe in something called decentralized
329944,they stand by this
329945,would it be possible to transfer collateral to optimism
329946,they would have to do it in anon manner so maybe giving a hint to core community at least which will spread it so we know
329947,yea were composable
329948,any info about it ser this is too alpha
329949,could you intro to the team pls
329950,their public resources are here
329951,basically their vault contracts are somewhat similar to gearbox credit accounts and are run by oracles
329952,ser why dont they make with gearbox
329953,interdasting
329954,are there plans for gearbox to support any zk rollups in the future
329955,what did you want to talk about i can ask around
329956,we dont like you
329957,interesting but why they are trading some of the real dogshit tokens
329958,nan
329959,profit is all ser
329961,because such drawdown risks arent worth those profits
329963,i dont think theyre trading those its an api demonstration for their existing product
329964,stop share that fake twitter
329965,relax
329966,makes sense thanks for explanation
329967,theyve started with a jupyter toolkit for algotrading basically
329968,i wish i knew what that means haha
329969,i think theyre using this for their vaults
329970,geofencing isnt usually done in the frontend layer so simply cloning frontend code and expecting it to be able to connect to the same backend serversservices upon deployment is unlikely to work perhaps a solution could be found in server configurations that route connections through a predefined array of proxies based in nongeofenced territories
329973,guys im sorry for offtopic but i dont have much communities to ask this i have some frien in ukraine he is helping innocent people to survive and asked me to donate some money he has card number but i cant transfer anything to him unfortunately due to those stupid sanctions it seems if anyone has solution to this problem please shoot me dm
329975,you can transfer money to the ukraine sanctions are againts russian and russian banks
329976,i cant i tried using few banks and payment systems its not like im making it up i literally tried already
329977,wisecom is also a good gateway im still paying my dev invoices through this
329978,try using eth_change_bot cheque or cex use mixer if you are in rf
329979,hey guys i m ukrainian in ukraine now helping our people out here to get by any donation are appropriated via crypto or bank
329980,im russian and i cant transfer to your privatbank card
329981,thanks
329983,oh this explains a lot
329987,i think the ukranian govt also prohibited all transactions coming in from russia
329988,this seems like the best solution i can basically just send any crypto to his card damn i forgot about this one
329989,thank you guys lets end it here seems we have found a good working solution use it wisely
329991,link for docs
329992,or ask anything in discord channels
329993,the community cant figure out how to build a ui they feel this strongly about
329994,does anyone have experience with claiming an inactive registered 2013 no activity whatsoever profile from twitter i keep sending them the requested documents but they reject it without comment
329995,
329996,a small step from unmarshal to make sure access to web3 is available for everyone
329997,great solution thanks sir
329998,
329999,inb4 lobsters fundraise from a16z at 1b valuation
330000,and open our own restaurant fap center and dev incubator
330001,fish farm aquarium restaurant
330002,read fap as lap ngmi
330003,is there anywhere that shows different yields for dif tokens
330004,trying to find somewhere i can park my usdc or other stable
330005,coindixcom
330006,are there any decentralised blockchain explorer not even sure how that will work but just curious
330007,thanks david
330009,i hope its possible in web3 and some adaptive strategies are able to be crowdsourced and adoptedbut im somehow very skeptical to to any magic bullets in active portfolio management it remains me biggest sector of cashgrab from retail forex market like pamm trading or portfolio bots and bots marketplacesthis is just doesnt work not a scam but cashgrab to make it even more attractive some projects are using ai with narratives likeai will generate u profit everydaybut in reality it doesnt work
330010,erigon otterscan still the best experience for ethereum
330011,akula otterscan soon
330012,yes some hft hedge funds are using ai models and algos for portfolio management and active algo trading but in my experience those were adaptive models which were tuning some basic strategy mostly stupid arbitragepricing even here the only thing which was working was models trainingtesting and selection every day based on most freshed databtw even this approach 100 loosing money during blackswans please share any opposite experience with algorithmic trading or crowdsourced strategies
330013,yes sir excited for akula too
330015,more like alternative to blockscan
330016,depends on how much theyve lost during those drawdowns i wouldnt expect these guys to outperform holding eth too much since only textbook strats are public as they claim but even 23 yield on top can be respectable long term
330018,is a cool doc send it cori_the_bee
330019,oops
330020,btw is 2tb ssd enough for erigon archive node
330021,they recommend 3 i think
330023,2 tb might be enough for a couple of weeks from now but it wont for long
330024,why would the merge reduce fees tho
330025,dont forget the merge wont really have any noticeable effect on throughputgas fees
330027,eh most people tend to demominate their gas fees in usd so if eth price goes down gas price in gwei will just go up assuming constant demand
330028,im frantically trying to think of transactions to do now while gas is sub 30 gwei though lol
330030,yeah that did cross my mind maybe i should buy a dozen
330031,wish there were derivatives based on gas
330032,they require a lot of computations hence oiler is doing it w starky stuff
330033,there used to be gas tokens that abused the selfdestruct opcode
330035,tkstanczak can shed some light before releases if he wants to idk
330036,not sure if still exists
330039,kinda fair its a waste of space haha
330040,couldve just renamed it to sudoku smh
330043,damn i am doing some starky more plonky stuff too definitely interested about learning more about projects in this space
330044,eth needs a borrowchecker instead of selfdestruct p
330045,yam had monthly gas options on uma not sure about the current situation
330048,big brain
330049,is there a comprehensive and updated website showing lending stacking pooling apr on all chainssomething like i have eth on ethereum there is aave with a certain apr ecc on fantom tarot impermax etc
330050,idk how accurate this is but coindixcom
330051,
330052,to migrate users to the new vlcvx contract all currently locked cvx has been unlocked from the old contract anyone who has votelocked their cvx will have to withdraw their tokens from the lock cvx page and relock in the new contract
330053,
330054,very nice thanks subscribed already
330055,hope it was helpful
330056,i thought dev inculator ahahah joke aside congrats guys
330057,
330058,hey all on acd today we discussed the proscons of postmerge mapping the latest json rpc keyword to a safe head block 4 sec delay which we dont expect to be reorged in normal network conditions instead of the absolute latest block providing extra security by default both options would be available so the question is about what we default to curious what folks here think about this
330059,does this mean the safe head rpc has some latency do devs still have the option to use the existing rpc or does it get deprecated
330060,safe head would return an older block until the current block has enough attestations to be deemed safe the rpc will keep supporting latest for the time being but the question is whether we map latest to that safe block or to the actual tip of the chain which we can also expose directly via eg a new unsafe flag
330061,near blockchain has a finality property for exactly that reason
330062,saving you a click
330063,yes we will have finalized too
330064,but it happens every 12 minutes so its not something we can swap into latest
330065,seems like multichainxyz will stop the service open source though
330066,wdym
330067,nan
330068,isnt that chainlist
330069,question is what happened to the tokens
330070,thats anyswapmulti not the same i think
330071,oh i thought was anyswap
330072,hey anybody hearing about this convex exploit
330073,im hearing rumors all tokens have been unlocked
330074,
330075,due to sanctions expect increase in non centralised stables like dai people are worried usdt and usdc will be blocking them
330076,thats an interesting composition if its supposed to be safe
330077,considering they voted usdc and friends in what happens if theyre compelled to comply
330078,
330079,i think it is impossible to block dai its like blocking ethereum network in a country
330080,famous last words
330081,wouldnt the blocking that needs to happen here be the blocking of addresses whether that be by fiatcoins or by dai itself
330082,protocol needs to be redeployed if you want to modify dai in any way
330083,aside from ust anything else that is truly decentralizedwell ust is as decentralized as the centralized control of terra and co
330084,reflexer or frax
330085,lusd
330086,lusd
330087,most decentralized
330088,even the ui is decentralized
330089,have u or anyone else here successfully voted claimed and staked via metamask and can confirm that it is safe to do so metamask is warning me of a potential threat when i try voting
330090,i personally did it and it worked
330091,i think it warns you to sign a message right
330092,they also have their dashboard for keplr running now i think
330093,its a pretty shitty uiux thoughin case you are looking for a validator destination again shameless shill evmosvaloper1teve9jdzedzu64mty72qc2888kh7t9hjchp5y2
330094,frax is backed by 80 or so usdc
330095,for dai the token itself yeah save for approval shenanigans thats unlikely to changebut going forward you dont need to redeploy everything do you
330097,its the same answer as when ppl were saying maker was gonna implement kyc cant be done in the current system
330098,the biggest problem of makerdai is usdc collateral which can be frozen otherwise i do not see any weak points
330099,yes and even this is manageable the fud is tiresome
330100,agreed maker is getting way too much shit from people who have no clue especially the ust and mim people are insufferable
330101,2 and 3
330102,ppl are just too easily influenced and love holding torches and pitchforks brownie points for independent thinkers
330103,he seems optimistic about mkr holders stopping such a vote given that token is even more concentrated than comp color me sceptical
330104,i suggest a bit of optimism in general of course maker can crash and burn there are no silver bullets but you better start understanding the collateral damage it can cause across the ecosystem if you wanna be on that side of history
330105,perhaps in matters like this i say lusd did it best its better to eliminate to the extent possible leverage compellors might have than hope its different this time
330106,no one is comparing these things though the more the merrier we all working towards common goals there is no winner takes all
330107,just stop hatin geez
330108,they are migrating their locking contract after discovering a vulnerability that wasnt exploited
330109,ahh that makes more sense
330110,no funds were at risk its all on their announcement
330111,
330112,we are in if someone blacklist maker on usdc
330113,nan
330114,whats your opinion on rai as a safe way to go in stable fully decentralized
330115,thread happening today about this
330116,rai is also legit
330117,for me it goes lusd rai othersfwiw i dont believe either is scalable for reasons rai explains in their docs
330118,1
330119,did ampleforth introduce smth new recently
330120,since forth happened youd be better off with even usdcim still very much in favor of the mechanism behind it not so much the project
330121,yeah ampl is best for pricing a future trade at roughly 1 each but it cant really be held safely across days as your holdings value is a of the market cap
330122,
330123,oef seems savage
330125,hey guys anyone got any info might be psyops so dont take it as fud
330126,i liked this post better when it was about some cool new eip that allows lower storage costs
330127,ctrlf for earlier tweets ser but anyway maybe he is just tired and wants plebs to fuck off he loves psyops let him be
330128,
330129,please check out this is 100 info
330130,reposting your original post cause its coolerthat is damn neat gonna save a lot of gas with this
330131,this space sucks sometimes
330132,yh i think we should just leave him alone like hes probably reading all this lol
330133,idk its over for fantom for solidly for andre how decentralized the project is if one developer leaving is its over
330134,discuss the work not the man
330135,fucking really i did ill stop posting since all i do is repost sorry sir
330136,not over but people like andre make a goodcompetitive project to an outstanding one most of the time
330137,never said it was over thats from the tweet i agree with you fantom is bigger than andre although he was probably the reason they started to gain big traction if being honest
330138,i think it was more the chain working during the bullrun
330139,was it didnt start to have real traction until andre started tweeting about it spooky and spirit release deployment yearn followed and then dex aggregators etc
330140,idk how much value adds tho discussing the why so wouldnt go to much about it tbh
330141,there was a lot of liquidity migrating into fantom because solidlyagree with fantom working hard but i think those two reasons are not mutually exclusive i think both reasons made fantom gain a lot of traction
330142,well andre was there since the beginning and it didnt move until about a year ago along with every other chain 3 years of flat
330143,
330144,if you go back a year and look at avax bsc ftm matic they all went nuts in january 2021 and he wasnt apart of all of them
330146,just saw this seems regulators are coming hard
330147,404
330148,if you mean the medium article go to the tweet then click the medium link dunno why telegram cut the link
330149,does anyone know an app to calculate how much the price would move in a liquidity pool if someone buys or sells x amount of tokens
330150,uniswap
330151,they give you a price impact
330152,anyone know a good api for nft s
330153,trying to build a simple table for my amateur website
330155,alchemy
330156,you can do this on furucombo soon
330157,opensea has one
330161,lel
330162,hey i never said it was a good one though rereading the question that was it
330163,
330164,what kind of table
330165,does anyone know people from defiprime it seems they cite our curation on mirror without any credit
330166,nan
330167,nan
330168,i dont believe its a coincide
330171,hm i actually thought it is just automated posting from mirror based on views or something like that
330172,stay safe out there banteg
330173,mirror doesnt provide public view data neither a browser thats why we create a curator dao to select excellent articles with a crawler
330174,arent crawling and scraping data from mirror violating their tos
330175,from arweave their contents are stored there
330176,thanks for the credit dear defi prime team
330177,most of the mirror links we posting coming from mirror_curator_dao kudos for curating this channel
330178,thx
330179,omfg
330180,
330181,otterscan should work with erigondevel branch bsc i intend to support it and it should work right now i dont say 100 sure because im still in the process of syncing my bsc node much bigger than mainnet
330182,fwiw many of etherscans features are fictions stuff like internal txns are not actually part of spec
330183,if you dont need archive data from block 1 you can enable pruning i have mine set to 1 yr ago and its using 1tb
330184,though iirc once you enable pruning you cant decrease the number of blocks to keep
330185,yes good note i think changing any pruning config will require fresh sync
330188,arent internal transactions just traces
330190,not since the beginning
330191,curious question for keeper functions in protocols that trade assets such as yearn harvests selling the rewards for the underlying what prevents keepers from sandwiching the trade do keepers just rug the pool on each harvest
330192,kind of i would need to scrap the website because i cant sort by coin s
330193,what do you mean you can just use search symbols to filter out what you need
330194,any solidity dev here can help me with reducing gas in my contract its a short one dm please thanks
330195,in response to the extraordinary events following russias invasion of ukraine the united states and the united kingdom have imposed expansive economic sanctions designed to hold russia accountable to comply circle is temporarily disabling all fiat payments from accounts located in russia including card payments from cards issued in russia this may impact your business and we apologize for any inconvenience
330196,next step freeze usdc on all suspicious accounts
330197,potentially it becomes kyc to move your usdc
330198,how would you even implement that
330199,well i would see that as a worst case scenario would be complex around contracts so maybe initially just freezing eoa funds pending kyc possibly contracts would need to kyc as a controlling company or dox founders problem with that is it would pretty much destroy usdc basically self destructing the control that gov has over it so probably wouldnt be that hardcore but its certainly possible
330200,most complexity probably lies around bridged assets side chains l2s and liquid derivative assets like ausdc so ya unlikely to be possible as a blanket approach without causing major trouble for non sanctioned by us entities
330201,hard to stay but 1 theres technical possibility to do so mechanics of blacklisting is actively used as analyze above showed 2 we have clear trend for regulation everything thats possible 3 fiat money regulated af
330202,any solidity telegram chats where one can ask questions
330203,
330205,thanks ruffr1d3r
330207,no worries
330208,
330213,mguan326 you can also check here loads of cool stuff
330215,i wonder what the solution is to unrekt the evmos rektdrop for those that use a ledger its been a pretty awful launch for those who are not followingthose eligible to receive evmos airdrop but keys created on ledger hardware wallet cannot claim while being diluted heavily with current staking apr around 6000one would think this issue would have been tested prior to launchcurrent fix in progressthere seems also to be an issue with ledger metamask but that may have a work around major issue is ledger keplr
330216,for me in general it says the claim coming soon
330217,i dont think the official claim dashboard is even up yet which begs the question why launch and activate inflation they delayed the launch once to avoid this kind of stuff happening but its been an absolute fuckup
330218,you are getting dilluted if not stake sorry for noob q
330219,so how to even claim without an ledger
330220,of course 200m circ tokens at launch majority of which are unclaimable and current inflation is 750k per day
330221,there have been dashboards built by some validators or could do manually
330223,metamask seems to only work with anyone know if its legit as mm warns during the signature
330224,yes is legit
330225,yep used it a few hrs ago all good
330226,then you might find this entertaining
330227,
330228,synthetix assets getting more volumes based on this tweet whats the catalyst
330229,whats the story with kp3r closing down
330230,maybe they need synthetix assets to buy synthetix stocks
330231,nan
330232,oh was andre the only maintainer
330233,what is the source for this how can u close down that if a ui is maybe shutting down just saying it doesnt mean a protocol stops
330234,is it working onchain if yes fine
330235,devs dont really use uis anyway
330236,fair
330237,
330238,also fair
330239,idk personally not taking on anchor and ust risk enjoying the rekt 4 yields fffs
330240,also chainlist
330241,can someone spin up an ipfs version
330242,not ipfs but theres this for now
330243,wait is that fixed forex or just keeper network
330244,funny how some people are asking etherscan to censor spoof erc20 transfers which do follow the spec internal transactions view was created years ago it helps users see eth transfers in sent by contact interactions
330246,defi building sers im happy to report to all of you that im in bali and its very good here much spiritual many healthy i see people extending lobsterdao into meatspace and gathering together in dubai why dont we move further and rent a cool villa or mansion together depends on how many for lobsters who are doing cool stuff i prepared some info coliving generation event if that works it would be cool to have lobsterhouses around the globe
330247,can you dm examples of these censored tokens generally only fake or brand infringement cases get this which helps protect users
330248,this is better for lobsterdao chat ser good to hear u r safu personally would never do such a thing cause that sounds like bad opsec idk the discussion can continue in lobsterdao chat
330249,for me it also shows claim your rektdrop coming soon anyone knows how to claim
330252,
330253,ive never heard of bacon protocol
330257,this is the old website kp3r already has a new one new one
330259,i have the perfect example
330260,thedao token is censored everywhere
330261,in this case you should be able to search for these tokens if you select tokens in the search bar dropdown only tokens that have gone through minimal verification by the team come up in results by default some people like to complain about censorship until they get scammed then they blame us for supporting scammers
330262,yes that dao uniswap metamask etc all have it banned
330263,ser
330264,i didnt say etherscan
330265,i said uniswap metamask etc
330266,ah you replied me replying to a question on etherscan
330267,yes
330268,some level of censorship is desirable
330269,malicious pathological tokens
330270,tbh in my experience those who complain about censorship often havent thought through other considerations such as scams or decency
330271,censorship is a wedge to take away freedoms instead of censorship us common decency
330272,whaaaat
330273,not true
330274,i may find a token like porn token offensive for example but no one is going to censor it and i wouldnt want then to people should be free even if it leads to their own destruction and people should also practice self control and patience with others who not see the world the same as you
330275,i understand this is a debate that cant be won some people say this others will complain there isnt enough censorship reality often more nuanced then a debate on telegram or twitter will achieve
330277,oh yeah you can also search for tokens in the search bar in top tokens page eg feel free to complete the exact word
330278,anyone experienced error 500 on gnosis safe was trying to access it but it wouldnt load the balance the balance looks fine on etherscan just that i cant initiate any transaction from the website directly
330279,looks fine for me jsust loaded to test
330280,
330281,was fine for my other safes too just 1 in particular and im not sure why
330282,andre please come back i know youre lurking in here
330284,you arent digging hard enough into the curve factory pools
330285,its a home loan project
330286,does anyone have a feeling that trading volume fees displayed on the solidly analytics site are over 10x more than the actual ones im comparing bribe fees im getting from voting and nonstaked lp on one pair and things are way off
330287,they are 20x higher
330288,its a fork of spookys analytics which has 02 fee
330289,whoever that dev is didnt bother to update the front end fee
330290,lol thanks
330291,np
330292,hey can anyone tell how tools like icy tools and compass art pick new nft listings for sale within seconds
330293,masq is offering beta to anyone in ukrainerussia dealing with censorship may be of use for anyone here
330294,i have seen the listing reflect on these tools as soon as they are listed for sale on opensea are opensea api that efficient because i keep hearing that opensea api are unreliable
330298,
330299,no need to respond just interesting
330300,full disclosure im a cc at dhedgeon dhedge you can create a pool yourself and trade into any assets that are white listed on the protocol we also support aave for borrowinglending and shorting you create the pool investors deposit funds into your pool and then you can use any of the whitelisted protocols to trade lp and short an incubated protocol called has started creating some automated strategy pools currently leveraged long and short eth and btc pools but theres more to come such as impermanent loss hedged lping
330301,anyone can be a manager on dhedge were on eth polygon and optimism so even if you dont have a tonne of aum its still feasible to run a pool and have an active strategy
330302,we will be soon next integration on optimism but for now you can achieve 3x leverage in pools using aave on polygon
330303,visa suspended all operations in russia
330307,thats essentially zerofee transfers and atm withdrawalscant have fees on something that doesnt exist
330309,its all happening too fast mastercard also followed quoting the tweet since the link seems to break for me and the only way to access the text was webarchive
330310,i think thats not true russianissued visa cards still work in russia
330311,mc had just done the same it seems
330312,nan
330313,read the press release they will not be international cards but will work in russia and non russiaisssued cc will not work in russia which is a killer for tourism
330314,yeah i read it they will not suspend all operations according to the release is my point
330315,mastercard will though it seems
330316,nan
330317,this episode of black mirror just never ends
330318,this is next level cancel you would have to exchange your money to ruble no one wants to do the atm
330319,i did my mastercard transaction today all good business is business hysteria is hysteria
330320,did you know royal dutch shell bought russian oil whats up with sanctions
330321,yes between the announcement to the real application it might takes 12weekssame for the sanction some will be applied from the 16march only but announced days earlier like in the case of swift
330322,can i ask a question about solidly i dont understand how work the rebase for the venft we have a query in the contract to show what we can claim with our venft but it shows 0 for the moment
330327,see this example before judge do a small research
330333,waht is evmos what makes it special and how to claim
330337,killer just bring good ol cash and have mirunionpay cobranded card which will work everywhere
330339,unionpay is widely available
330340,yes
330342,sers do i need to approve weth uni router to provide liquidity i am approving usdc and still getting transferhelper transfer_from_failed error that usually means its approval cant find weth method from uni to do it tho thanks
330343,yes you need to approve both erc20 tokens
330345,whats a good community for solidity devs other than crypto devs on discord
330346,you may watch porn in denmark where said porn is legal then watch same porn in usa where it is illegal
330347,these are for profit services at the end of the day not public goods
330348,unionpay is chinese
330352,
330353,kinda interesting stuff
330354,sp33qr next time so much politics is a perma ban you forgot where you are share a big piece fine we all read no one cares of your everyone couch opinions unless its a raw fact
330357,does anyone know if its possible to bridge back from metis semiinstantly
330358,forgot it had a 7 day bridge back
330359,you can use cbridge
330360,thank you
330361,sirs
330362,
330363,the moment you need a cvx unlock function for 4 year locked kp3rs
330364,i think its good for him he is a best builder in defi for 3 years
330365,see you in next cycle andre
330366,good stockholm syndrome
330367,started a list of useful librariescontract deployments on different chains including testnets create prs with other useful stuff
330368,seems solidly frontend getting nuked or do i read that wrong not a github smartie
330369,lobsterdao devs can take the role of upkeeping the ui maybe then and inserting their own fees into it liquity model idk risky and hard but just saying
330371,
330372,people with enough brains and resources can coup now tbh for good
330373,
330374,this is not andres personal wallet just fyi
330375,but ecosystem bags geist beets scream etc got sold in advance
330376,nothing wrong with that per se because this is a wallet of a trader affiliated ecosystem wallet probably but make of that whatever you will not proving anything
330377,the last tx is all ftm being deposited into geist or what is it
330378,
330379,wo a few days in advance it seems nice find
330380,nice idea ivangbi
330381,isnt that what andre always wanted to build a dex with no one maintains it
330382,that is indeed you can take over and either abuse nah or build further
330383,sounds good to me in theory even though its always good to have a marketer 247
330384,i am not speculating on anything like that the decision to shut down and doing shutting down was probably not a 1 hour work to delegate everything etc so it was just continuous so there is likely no relation even
330385,well ye daos need to take over but with sushi nobody did that yet
330387,sorry it was posted before didnt see
330388,exactly this is why i am skeptic
330389,nwnw all good
330390,i dont remember a project with no pushing team that succeed
330391,sushi has strong internal backlash these one have no internal to begin with
330392,ask for a print promise things and then do something
330393,very possible
330394,imo when regulation will deepen less and less people probably would want to be responsible on that
330395,good luck to all of us
330396,nobody stops u from being anon there
330397,i would think more and more
330398,not sure how these anon users will be dealt as if regulation comes across board why would any protocolcompany would let you remain anon
330400,ser this protocol has no kyc u can insert its all onchain already its not a web 2 company so your statements do not make sense sorry couch legal
330401,the issue could be ur personal bank source of funds but this is always solveable
330402,soon we will see a shift from blocking funds to nationalising funds meaning steal youll remember my words
330403,politics aside i cant argue here everybody in finance world is being given such a high degree of blocking subjectivity that its becoming really inside oh well
330404,kp3ryearn already have teams running them so less relevant with regards to their frontends etc
330405,hopefully andre is ok
330406,sucks to see same hope andre is ok
330407,ye kp3r is a big chunk of promises and barely something live surly gonna be okay
330408,what bunny said
330409,
330410,fantom eco had been good for yfi revenue though right
330411,dev does something community thinks wagmi because dev did something community realizes they are ngmi after all blames dev dev burns out trying to do something while community throws rocks dev eventually quits community throws more rocks because dev quitsthis is why we cant have nice things
330412,one of the issues i see with all the projects out there is that they are very person oriented instead of the project a lot of the communications of the projects happen with the personal twitter handlers i gets very fragile
330417,community bad dev good
330418,its crazy how every cycle dev burns out trying to do something happens at the same time as token unlocks and bear markets
330419,plebs aped in a project after that blaming on devs they deserve it kek
330421,so are they not even supposed to get burned out now
330422,you mean the speculators starts going for the devs head when up only ceases making for an unhealthy environment to continue building
330423,probably because the community gets super toxic around those times
330424,its more the fact that some people have no conviction in the space at all they are just willing to push through it because of the huge fiat pay off
330425,again just saying what i see every few years
330426,can we please not have this discussion again happened just earlier this week and following
330427,its the community throws more rocks because dev quits stage cant stop it
330428,you must not be looking too closely then
330431,bullish on devs that continue building during the tough times
330432,solid is a test version of old deriswap right
330433,bullish on stupid comments
330435,andre continued building during 201819
330436,reviewing projects working on ftmyfi etc
330437,no
330438,have a look at the wall street emotions chart you might find a better explanation there with how communities behave around devs
330439,i have goldfish memory so correct me if im wrong working on yfi in 2018 isnt right surely
330440,1819
330441,when did i said 17
330442,you do realize he worked on other things right
330443,no need to excessively moralise lolcrypto potential to make loads of money paired with toxic conditions when things dont go so well
330444,to be honest i only find good wishes to andre in all chats and people understandably pissed of the price action
330445,but i guess you see things differently when youre the one in the spot even if majority of messages are positive that wont weigh enough
330446,across twitter and even here the resentment seems to not stop its crazy to watch tbh
330447,theres a whole lot more you dont see flung at devs in private and the unfortunate amount of expectationentitlement people have especially when they become belligerent it adds up and people dont want to deal with it
330448,developerdao
330449,perhaps some should have taken note in andres medium post not so smart contracts
330450,all the more reason for devs to stay anon
330451,damned if you do damned if you dont
330452,satoshi gonna rug any moment now
330453,skeleton_in_a_chairjpg
330454,ok enough memezes good point raised here it is what it is ggwp
330455,because when a bear market starts significant pressure increases on the devswaiting for someone to take over solidy im sure itll live on yearn is already very stable without andre
330456,solidex posted they are but not sure how accurate
330457,
330458,i guess i mean if the projects are self sustainable then brilliant no problem but i see the number of contributions everywhere right now generally going down rapidly and its just sad to me that many people will abandon the space because market conditions are badnot saying thats why andre is leaving i have no idea why he is but that is 100 a general trend
330463,here is what they saidandre and i have decided that we are closing the chapter of contibuting to the deficrypto space
330465,thats true but the good builders continue to build just that during bull theres a lot more contributions by forkers or people trying to cashgrab i dont feel that innovation necessarily is much more during a bull
330467,i think it is really dependent though even if there is good innovation but no one want to participate in it then it makes to use also toptier development is with toptier teams eitherways
330469,haha sad for them it seems to be taken care of already
330472,redactedthey are a sub project on a different chain for a different protocol really no space for lobsters to discuss much we know em you can farm and love em ur thing but done
330473,i want to share only something about the building of startups concept perhaps what has happened was the best for the defi industry
330475,
330476,the fact that some people in twitter are saying rugged blows my mind
330479,andre replieoooooooors are an interesting breed of person
330480,there have been people saying that on pretty much anything hes tweeted in the last year
330489,i honestly want to understand their train of thought i cant fathom ha their rationale
330491,thats like a dollar store ape ser much like his trash opinion
330492,out of interest what would this chat be saying if it was julien that did thisandre is entitled to do what he wants but he was the face of all these projects most only got popularity due to his involvement to some it will feel like a rug
330493,one is a dev and a builder another one is not you can stop your mental comparisons there
330494,he doesnt stop all his projects just closed the frontend and handovers
330495,contracts are live and working frontend can be maintained by anyone this outcry of helplessness is the problem andre is pointing out
330497,hi julien
330498,just out of curiosity has anyone else considered that andre can always just make an anon acct if he feels like getting back in or alternatively may have already
330499,like are we really lamenting the exit of the innovation that andre represents from the space or something else
330500,i agree with its a symbol of the trend
330501,i think i meant something different than how you understood that last line i edited it to make it clearer
330502,yes more in this new regulation phase maybe he want to be anon and was a cleaning movement the work is done he has fulfilled what he announced he was going to build he is within his right to seek more privacy
330504,aaaaand is enough seeing a bit of craziness at this point
330505,whats yearns dd process to add a new strat do its vaults any public info around
330506,not all of it is public process is mostly internal but some points we check are governance can the contracts be changed upgraded msig situation are the signers known in the space past audits and if it matches latest deployed code how long has the protocol been working do they have bug bounties how have they handled issues if they had in the past then we checked against the strategy the contract code we will use the strategist writing the strategy needs to deep dive and prove how and why we are not going to get rug and a second security person validates the document and goes thru the code as wellif there are things we dont like of the protocol we usually can talk to them and ask them to change it most are keen to do itfinally after all of this we score the strategy to a given riskimpact score and usually brand new protocols will have higher risk so we would cap the impact at some amount that is not life ending for yearn after the inital review we schedule recurring reviews of the strategy and dd to give out to audit firms or security contractors or other internal security role to have schedlue like inspections only after these are done the risk score can improve and the strat can take more funds
330507,twittercom0xblascostatus1500455598684618753
330508,doing gods work
330509,several links to add on topic from megithubcomkayisweb3fromzeroweb3smsunartocombasedbuilders useweb3xyz
330510,dont forget cryptozombies
330511,another good source in my opinion is useweb3xyz
330512,will be in special play learn compilation capturetheethercomethernautopenzeppelincomcryptozombiesiodappuniversitycomdamnvulnerabledefixyz
330513,so many ways to learn to buidl good time to build some public goods
330514,more links for my compendium thanks
330515,what the easiest way to get all the bytes for a specific eth block i mean the actual data that is hashed to create the blockhash
330516,
330517,great thread to put all dumbass shit to bed ncerovac u r useful
330518,thx ser ibidino did that magic
330520,
330521,
330522,lots of chatter on ct about this i think theres a lot of misinformation the contracts code will still be live but hosting the uis are shutting down we can all pitch in and host the new uis if all the contributors on those projects choose to not do so trustnode just posted a write up i personally dont think its a bad thing andre has done so much for this space and if he wants time off or to leave for hood thats fine more people around to buidl imo the space is just in a very weird place rn so not surprised
330523,cryptd0e see who is taking over uis
330524,nice ty just missed this one
330525,thats just an indication of even people heavily involved in the space having a wrong mental model when it comes to defi products
330526,my convex apys
330527,might as well shit into my own mouth
330528,algo stables are at 5 apy loool fkoff
330529,imagine taking their risk for 5
330530,omfg my anoos is so red these apys are disaster
330532,yea i think this will cause a lot of chaos to those just grifting in the space its unfortunate thats its come to this really will miss andre
330534,most probably the chaos is a necessary evil for the long run the way i see it web3 is dangerously close to developing the same kind of centralized dependencies as web2 some realignment like this from time to time is need to keep that in check
330535,dangerously close is an exaggeration but not too far either
330537,plenty of developers in the ecosystem andre will come and go just like many others who were unnamed and contributed to their respective projects some dont even get recognition for their work this too shall pass
330538,this is very accurate its becoming harder and harder to draw a distinction between web2 and web3 everyone just slaps web3 on things now even when its all just vc backed and vc chains running things defi needed a bit of a kick to the nuts to help correct things
330539,it definitely is a lot of the space has become the same kind of networking mess that web2 space is accused of and more and more capital is getting locked in these channels where outsiders rarely have access to
330540,use dao funds to host the all the uis would be good publicity
330541,imagine thinking web3 and web2 involves different ppl tech is different but ppl the same
330542,i think its less the people but rather how the markets industry evolves it happens to every single new spacemoney flow is all the same alwayshasbeenjpeg
330544,id say the advantage of defi over web2 space is that the underlying structures that power the ecosystem are very deliberately designed to push back against the natural human inclination to gravitate towards strong authoritative figures if this had happened in web2 world theres a nonzero chance yearns backend wouldnt exist any more
330545,nan
330546,except in a very limited number of applications decentralisation is a meme
330547,youre not wrong just the scope of your statement is much more limited than most assume
330548,i had no clue price action could cripple a groups ability to operate their product guess i stand corrected
330549,it cant for sure but the point im making is for most applications atm it does
330551,im not discussing price action more the fundamental will this product still work tomorrow question if you honestly think yearn is finished because andre has left that sounds very shortsighted
330552,i dont disagree ser im just making the point that what you are saying is applicable only to a very limited number of projects
330553,despite the immutability of contracts
330554,youre contending that a given projects value is based purely on hype rather than any fundamental valueoffering
330555,yes depending on who you ask
330556,to a large degree unfortunately
330557,where do you think we are
330558,ser it is a rhetorical question
330559,in most cases yes
330560,lets accept the premise that projects are built mainly on hype that leads to the further question are all the people building on fantom only because they like andre or are there people who might have come for andre and stayed because they found something else that was interesting same with yearn are there people building for yearn because they only like andre or do they actually see utility in iti think the utility is there at this point and the hype is selfperpetuating without andre though a year ago my answer would have been different out of all of his projects solidly is probably the most unlikely to have this brandloyalty outside of the man himself however i think fantom as it was prior to january was running just fine with minimal involvement from andre i build there and i dont have any plans to stop building cause andre isnt involved any more just like the people
330561,id say yearn network effect is more down to banteg than andre and has been for a while
330567,is this for real
330568,china is a bad influence smh
330569,but iirc russia has some exercises regularly where it makes sure its ready to disconnect from the global internet any time needed
330570,we built a working frontend will be improving its core to remove the annoying rpc issues and also work on the routing issue
330571,this document does not mention anything of the kind and so far it is russia that is disconnected from the internet from the outside for example cogent magistral operator has banned ru region same did cisco and so on list is big
330572,the document lists tips on opsec and there is nothing that can be interpreted as disconnecting from the internet anyway i am in moscow until the march 20th and i can confirm it
330573,i have a satellite internet equipment set up and connected so be sure youll know if something like this happens before the 20th
330574,mostly bonds if a keeper misbehaves the protocol can rug its bondsimilar to how nodes work on a chain but it doesnt punish downtime rather misbehaviour
330575,i was thinking this through as a tangent to a project last yearthe limiting factor is its basically an oracle for very niche ie likely unique queries so the economics of paying for multiply replicated work in looking up and storing the information means you need either 1 high roller users 2 a specialised blockchain or 3 tight tradeoffs on the blockchain trilemma eg decentralised 35 validators and probably 2 or 3 of those optionschainlink has http get so 3 must be possibleiirc parsiq were intending to move towards 2but tbh i want to see this happen so feel free if you want to dm to spitball i may still one day buidl the thing and more eyes brains on it is a good thing
330576,so something like how grt nodes work maybe
330577,not familiar but i would guess yeah
330579,gm
330580,nice to be back
330581,gm
330582,wen polygon lugano hq
330583,looking forward to all these other flavours of polygon coming along
330584,hahaha not only for polygon brother but trying a compliant and regulated home for all crypto startups and more importantly daos
330586,uae
330587,gn ser i still remember your explicit replies to andre on twitter you and many others from polygone team like mr bjelice are disgrace for whole crypto community
330588,they transitioned to this system a few years ago sovereign internet law was announced in 2019 then sometime after they tested it
330589,ohh but now you know that those harsh words were for a reason i guess that became apparent once again last few days no sadly that time i just couldnt take it anymore
330590,can we just respectfully avoid personal conflicts etc for now
330591,like the man has left leave him alone sandeepnailwal its great having you here
330605,rightly said sir but we dont have to be married to the game we can all do positive sum good work for the advancement of web3 instead of participating in these games by some incumbants
330606,did you just come here to pirouette on someone elses grave
330607,incumwhat sounds painful
330608,i urge both sides to remain sane or i will use desperate measures mutes thank you
330609,it might be look like that but i wasnt trying was just responding to msgshappy that i m back to the lobster community uponly
330611,this
330612,a review to help keep up with events over the past week geopolitical events keep cucking the market evmos airdrop fumble troubling geographical censorship memecoin mri ripping upcoming celestia modular narrative ens domain sales nft cool off luna rally solunavax shoutout andre leaving crypto everyone and their grandmother trying to get into the metaverse capital flooding into the space ct sentiment bearish narratives meta news data always lots going on in crypto
330613,ok now it feels like bear market
330614,it has been a while rektplebs going to get very busy
330615,why
330616,devs do something mentality
330617,lrc ceo stepping down too
330622,yea has felt bera to me for a couple months
330623,socially at least
330624,some outlier communities tho
330625,does anyone know when eth merge will be
330627,
330628,i think i heard some time in summer is planned but its been delayed so much i guess no one really knows
330630,next chinese new year
330631,shanghai is planned for q4
330632,
330633,bro no one at yearn is there doing shit cause of andre
330634,this is why you never trust an african
330635,when fantom did its seed round andre wasnt even on board yet
330636,yes that was my point
330637,well its fair to say that if wasnt for andre fantom would still be chasing blockchain remitance deals with afghanistan and stuff like that where theres no profit to be made
330638,true or if they do they can always double check stuff however wo an official ui very little is stopping anyone to spin up a replicate and change the smart contract interactions to transferfrom so yeah would be neat to at least have something up and backed by some digital entity
330639,all fantom defi are andre
330640,you mean like cover and cream
330641,just as btc and eth these were created for multichain but tells a lot
330642,99 of defi on any chain is just ported or cloned from an eth project tbf
330643,on evm ledgers
330644,its not the point these are just wrapped tokens creations
330645,if you mint a nft is your address at risk because you interacted with a potential scam contract address or can this only be if you approve the nft
330646,all andre stuff is now redacted you really dont get the point of let a person detox one day discussions were enough all was covered also fantom chats were exhaustive in their explanation of the affiliation moving on
330648,no ur probably finein general calling random smart contracts shouldnt compromise ur existing assets unless you called approve beforehandbut obviously dont go around doing this just because
330649,thanks mate
330650,i dont necessarily think projects are built on hype ac was building projects when there was no one left in the space 2018 2019 this space is just borderline unrealistic in terms of expectations right now mainly because its bulloverheated to put it into perspective a project released at this stage of development would have received different reception if it was released in late 2019 a time when builders were helping each other and users were realistic mostly but now just because you arent releasing ipograde protocols and the token isnt returning exponential gains out the gate its a rug builders who love building start to lose incentivemotivation to build anything
330651,yeah some great useful protocols out there that arent being used much but certainly could be useful but no degen farm or they were very good secrets
330653,thumbsup reaction
330654,if a useful protocol doesnt have ponzinomics is it really useful
330655,uniswap compound aave curve prior to the wars and so many more
330656,protocols i use the mostyearnuniswapmatcha
330657,it was more rhetorical but yeah there are some good utility first protocols
330658,solid is actually very useful its 001 fee swap it has a lot of utility and potential to kill uniswap sushi curve altogether
330659,now we need builders to iterate on acs work
330660,and bring the product to mvp to finalized product
330661,i am hopeful that at least one of the fork achieve this
330662,isnt the north star of incentives for solidly is to direct to most volume pool
330663,thats how dexes should be i guess
330664,shh im trying to work sir dont make me contemplate the zen of ponzinomics
330665,frankly at 001 swap they will get all swaps from aggregators
330666,so that will get volume with or without rewards
330668,
330669,where are you guys farming now that the solidly frenzy is seemingly over eth and stables
330670,in the backyard ser
330671,how would you iterate whats missing
330672,iterate doesnt always mean you have to add new features it could be just about tweaking the existing ones to find the right productmarket fit
330673,agreed what would you tweak
330674,we never lie more than before the elections during war and after hunting georges clemenceau
330675,only as long as theres liquidity when emissions tail off who will provide liquidity no one unless those limited emissions are highly valuable which will only be true if the transaction volume is high enough to make the minisicule percentage fees not so minuscule in absolute terms so what will happen between now and three months from now to drive that volume
330676,
330677,why such large discrepancy occurs and when arb mgavaudan
330678,03 fee uniswap pools often see more revenue than 1 pools because of higher volumes
330679,did yearn ever update 220 given the lower rates now or no milkyklim
330680,
330681,interesting
330682,any thoughts on what maia is building on metis with hermes solidly fork
330683,this is not a blanket solution it may work in some cases and for some time but eventually attackers will recognize the patterns of those monitoring systems and work around them could be effective against low effort hacks in the long termessentially this is no different from the idea of circuit breakers the problem lies in defining suspicious conditions in a way which only covers hacks and not regular activity
330684,but solidly revenue doesnt go to liquidity provides the token is the only incentive
330685,i think the theoretical assumption is that solid will correlate with fees thus making issuance more valuable for lps even if the amounts reduce
330686,my lord if you want to rage quit crypto go take a look at the plebs losing their minds over a potential chain reset this hasnt been indicated as occurring in evmos community channel
330687,
330688,
330689,i personally agree that this would be the correct move in this case there were no liquidity pools on osmosis for evmos or any other dex so only rektage would be p2p trading
330690,tbh if you are trying to make somewhat of a fair launch is it and thats your only moat kinda0 you should aspire to make it closer to fair launch with equal opportunities onchain
330691,i have no context on evmos i am just larping by saying maybe refixing is not so bad
330692,its supposed to be fair launch rekt drop was no presale devs are definitely in a difficult position here but i think worse off if they dont start again clean in a few weeks when ready
330693,but how would bridges work in that case wouldnt lets say eth sides of bridges be basically locked
330694,either way one group is gonna lose so there wont be a solution to satisfy everyone
330695,there were no bridges active yet
330696,this also true perhaps those early ones who got an edge are not too bad left w it
330697,that would imply they are real and not just randoms then over longterm is fine
330698,well who will lose exactly if reset no real players would have been trading this p2p given the state of things i doubt much was traded p2p at all
330699,i cant tell the amount of otc traders but everyone who has done so would lose of course on thee other hand you could argue that it was the risk of buying otci prefer the reset solution because i think there are more people affected negatively by the partial launch which diluted the rewards of anyone who had errors andor is using ledger
330700,its not even about the edge it was such a failed launch and requires major upgrades would be technically simpler to relaunch v2 and a much cleaner start to things doing it again either way it is certainly an interesting state of events i wouldnt want to be in those devs shoes right now you should see the v2 commits on github dont think theyve slept for a week
330701,also calling it a rekt drop while being itself a rekt rekt drop is kinda funny dont be that chain
330702,recent trend of dao governance pioneered by dani lives onlook at this stellar example of governance at sommelier zakimanian singlehandedly decided not to go ahead with the proposal voted in by the community
330703,nan
330704,web3 is the scam after all
330705,look at me i am the dao now
330706,yes its scam just get a lot of money from vcs and go have fun at crypto events
330707,or governance vote and freeze someones funds and send them to to charity idk lol the big problem is that everyone thinks they owe someone im waiting for adequacy to come to web3 but it seems it will last forever
330708,is it sommelier they were showing some governance proposals blabla and finally its zakimanian deciding everything lol
330710,and keep twitter shitposting thats also very important thing that you have to do
330711,this is ridiculous they say they dont have resources to proceed with verification of data and in the meantime they have raised twice multiple millions from top vcs
330712,and after it people still think that the onegoal game would always be on their side
330713,wow quite a few people are vocal i didnt even keep track what is the tldr
330714,please stop tagging a person and be more clear this pleb behavior crying is antilobsters be concrete
330715,discussing this move
330716,yes but what is that sip tldr of yesno etc
330717,we come again to the question of whether or not a company can give a damn about voting decisions lol
330718,is there a link to the sip or the details please or some previous context on it
330719,nothing abstract please the discussion should it be allowed is too vacuumed
330720,ok herethere was this proposal sips002 on sommelier governance forum that was about distributing somm tokens to early eth usersand the next accepted by governance step was sips003 proposing moving community pool funds in preparation of distribution of somm tokens to early eth usersand today one of cofounders is writing that he could not verify data from sips002 and sips003 so he is cancelling sips003 voted by community
330721,thank u this is clear reading up
330722,starlink or alternatives
330723,and they are of course doing dev so hard that they dont have any time to verify any snapshot data doesnt apply to shitposting and having fun at denver
330724,both sips002 and sips003 proposals were well discussed by the community and finally accepted by the governance what me and other community members dont understand why there was needed this daogovernance theater if in the end one person is deciding the future of
330725,alternatives of course i wrote this article a long time ago describes my equipment wwwlinkedincompulsehowhacksatellitehewd
330726,advisory dao
330727,what if that random smart contract calls approve functions on high profile collections think apes art blocks etc would you see that in metamask eg if your transaction is writing to function x of the random smart contract and this function x does all kinds of things including calling approve functions on other smart contracts is that possible
330728,continuing to pursue uniswap v3 is a recipe for failure
330729,im currently working on the aave cellar launch
330730,thats the primary focus
330731,dont have bandwidth for anything else
330732,here is an example0x69e8b735ef83581de92c2618a1cfa55c05ddafff is in the volumefi distributionzero evidence it ever interacted with sommelier
330733,we dont really have the time to go through and audit everything in the volumefi proposal but the assumption in the governance proposal was the data could be trusted
330734,im not opposed to coming up with some distribution to pairings uers in the future
330735,but i dont have the engineering bandwidth to work on it right now
330736,peter we get your frustrated but the fact that the data in sips 003 which was proposed by volumefi cant be validated makes it impossible to justify continuing with the airdropfunds would go back to the community pool which means they will be used for future ecosystem developments and growth of the protocolbut as zaki already mentioned we are not opposed to an airdrop for our early sommelier pairings users its just that we currently dont have the manpower to focus on itlet us launch our first cellars and push staking rewards live then we can revisit this
330737,we are not opposed to an airdrop for our early sommelier pairings users its just that we currently dont have the manpower to focus on it
330738,tldr lets do it later
330739,i dont see the negativity now then why the screaming
330740,do you have any time to help them verify the dataa lot of people in the sommelier chat somehow miss the point noone there is saying early users shouldnt get rewarded its just that someone has to find a fair way to verify who was an early user otherwise your rewards will get diluted by people who have used uniswap but arent eligible for the sommelier criteriai think thats something where the community can be constructive and help out instead of purposely misunderstanding the whole discussion
330741,right now im trying to figure out what to do about this osmosis incentives land mine that we hit
330742,doing the eth airdrop under these conditions would rug all the osmosis lps
330743,it would also be a lot of arb volume across the gravity bridge that will hurt the cellar launch
330744,i wouldnt be so sure tldr lets postpone it indefinitely
330745,so there are two sides1 subjective dev team who realized changes needed to be made2 people and users who expected an airdrop and liquiditywhat happened 1 data wasnt verified used as excuse2 devs decided traction timing etc need to change3 votes which happened now dont reflect the point 2question ye what cia said we come again to the question of whether or not a company can give a damn about voting decisions
330746,is this fair as tldr vardhanam
330747,is this implicit doxing d
330748,neither confirm nor deny
330749,also months and months of radio silence with community and then suddenly a message in telegram chat stating i decided not to go ahead with the proposalno announcements no discussion on governance forumthats my biggest issue with this
330751,were there promises endorsements timeline hype for this happening prior if yes i can understandthe issue sometimes happening is that dev teams ae overlyexcited but dev has its own milestones which always changeits important but hard to keep community expectations which drive engagement in order see somewhat paraswap airdropis that the issue here what i am trying to say
330752,a solution would be if every team hired a fulltime dev whos only discussing on forum and tg so that other devs dont get burned out i agree that more communication would probably have helped here because i fully understand zakis concerns that he cant proceed with the airdrop as it is but i am not deep enough into sommelier to understand if other milestones should get neglected for some time to proceed with sip003 first
330753,people are retarded there summarizes them discussion that everyone is having
330754,nan
330755,def a lot of text to read pls tldr ppl think soft governance is hard governance and dev said nah maybe later
330756,well while people are retarded 1 has brains so your comms should be as such as to allow that 1 to be on the same wave with you because they can potentially become contributors you dont need to comfort the total idiots but not comforting anyone leaves you in a sad place
330757,yes
330758,probably because of the difference in orderbook vs vamm perp models
330759,were also on eth l2s evm so wont be arbing anything on solana in short term
330760,more of this ser
330761,never have so many faught over such little things
330762,goldilocks
330763,its more important to be likes than to be rightcorrect thats the lesson andre taught me
330764,its all a popularity contest at the end of the day yes
330765,it is tiresome yea agree lobsterdao feeling like the principals office after the school playground fight
330766,only cia and ivan have such mindshare
330767,
330768,so ivan we going to do march madness this year
330770,no i am not burger to play ball ask larry
330771,cest la vie
330772,google so sexist
330773,y only show mens
330774,sentinam meam sacculos
330775,et devs aliquid
330776,yup
330777,
330778,interesting anyone following uxd any comments maybe mgavaudan
330779,i mean im obviously biased here but theyre essentially selling their governance token to cover the losses incurred because of those huge negative funding rates
330780,is there a world where that model works which would justify the imperfections caused now
330781,its why we went with a different model for lemma where we abstract pnl into a vault
330782,a lot more sustainable imo
330784,with current mechanism no
330785,that said im sure theyre thinking about ways to improve on their model dirac there seems like a smart guy
330786,also to be clear we lemma are also going to have to improve on our current model since growth will be limited otherwise
330787,its why were actually coming out with a really cool new primitive built on usdl soonish
330788,is it still possible to withdrawal to binance or kraken from russia also with credit card or just sepa in ruble
330789,use p2p currently should work with tinkoff bank card all cards issued on ruterritory will work only in russia since 10th unionpayissued cards eg zenit bank work abroad and for crossboarder payments and will continue working in russia and abroad after 10th
330790,deus will optimize this by offering onchain derivs with funding rates from big volume sources for example a cex in a decentralized way by offering 3rd party lps to take a trade onchain and possibly countertrade elsewhere if someone from uxd is here contact me
330791,ob or peer to pool
330792,what chain l2 will this be on
330794,does anyone know an extension or tool similar to this one the goal is to add documentation comments natspec to solidity code that can be filled out
330798,
330799,new fud
330800,i believe they decided to take the opportunity to overhaul quite a few aspects of staking which i imagine explains partially at least why its taking so long to rollout
330801,is there a good tokenized etf funds on chain
330802,indexcoop
330803,what about real world tokenized etf funds
330804,no one we can recall ftx does offer some things i think but obv is centralized
330805,working on it
330806,let us know when it is done im keen for it
330807,anywhere onchain to trade commodities preferably not l1
330808,kwenta optimism
330809,apparently there are no commodities there
330810,mirror on terra if youre into that has uso and ishares silvergold
330811,sweet was hoping to get exposure to the actual commodities but this may just work as well thank you
330812,thanks gamestop
330813,partner and dumping
330814,couldnt tell about their implementation but if youre looking for more info you might want to listen to bankless podcasts they recently held a panel with them poap and lens protocol
330815,actually i listened but not much in terms of actual impelemtation
330816,is there a website that provides public keys of cexes should be possible
330817,not exactly what you want but nametags could be useful for we youre doing
330818,
330820,so gamestop is a weakhand lmao selling before the news
330821,gmwhat wallets do people here use other than metamask and why
330822,frame because its awesome
330823,
330824,thanks will give this a try
330825,
330826,samczsun saved the day again
330827,hello friends have a question for ceos and funds whats the medium fee you usually pay to people who help in attracting investments is such commission usually 100 transparent for investors or hidden how much do you pay in attracted currency and in projects tokensjust formulating my contract with brokers and thinking about which prices are ok
330828,if the project is good enough the number is 0
330829,interesting one i know few cases when its around 75125 but yeah as mentioned above it much better when its 0
330830,hello everyone what is the best way to purchase stablecoins via wire transfer or cash for institutional investors has anyone faced this issue considering doing it directly via circle or tether with 10bp commission but maybe there are better ways
330832,25 is what i know some cases are always outliers based on who is bringing who and what their demands are not always transparent projects though will have to account and is part of the contract you would sign with the introducer
330833,0
330834,ideally but sometimes a bridge helps
330835,guys i know we promised not to talk about andre again but there is this
330836,andre said there were devs helping him find bugs before the launch where one of them was basmag0x i assume remember as such this is nothing against andre as conspiracy this is just showing solidex grapes was a bit more on the inside due to their work i assume no love or hate
330837,solidex got a pretty bad score from us 24
330838,no testing no audit no access controls
330839,usually a good sign of a project not built to last
330840,they said chat admin doing an audit now but cant release details till complete or who is going it sus
330841,it seems more than a bit on the inside if the grapessolidex domain was registered before solidly was even announced
330842,solidex is immutable
330843,so is solidly
330844,why the voting bug persists with work around i suppose
330845,the way defisafety rates projects isnt build to last you cant apply blanket ratings to various defi project as if they should all behave the same
330846,its like when your team said curve should have a timelock
330847,we iterate our processes frequently and specialise the review based on dev feedback
330848,it just shows you have no understanding of how our protocol works so its hard to take your work seriously
330849,and i have nothing against defisafety it could potentially be a useful public good service but not in its current form
330850,we contacted your development team in advance of publishing the review but never heard anything back a lot of our reviews are collaborative efforts with developers eg stakedao which goes live later today has been a weekslong discussion with the developers carefully applying the questions and ensuring they are relevant
330851,basam0x twitter account was created along with grapes finance though it s a mock account
330852,its never us just shouting into the void we give dev teams as much time as necessary to highlight things for our userbase
330853,i appreciate your confidence in us and were very open to feedback how might we improve it to be more of a public good
330854,btw charlie_eth how did you guys decide to entrust solidex with your venft it was quite a few millions in there what s the process
330856,you cant apply a checklist to a protocol to decide whether it meets security standards most robust protocols have no or minimal admin rights and immutability but you penalize those because non existing admin rights arent sitting behind a timelocked multisig another note is that thats just my personal opinion but none of those teams owe you time if they want to help you work towards your report thats fine but they basically get hurt because they dont want to take the time to show you how things work
330857,insiders pushed for it which sucked there wasnt much other choice though
330859,look at code look at available options talk to people not much we can do on such short notice i guess it doesnt matter now though
330860,i cant get a read solidex code skem cash grab or ground up built to last ui seems great lol
330861,just semianon semiinsider devs i think they had have decent intentions cant say anything else any bugs are natural in new code nobody is protected from it see their virtue with time nobody can attest now
330862,hmm i can see the confusion we dont penalise protocols that do not have timelocks provided that they explain why they do not have timelocks look at our convex review c2tp was super clear in explaining how it worked and did a good job documenting this i wrote a guide citing cvx as a near perfect example they score this protocols are rarely scored on the content of their security measures instead they just need to show that theyve considered it and have documented thisas for whether or not we deserve your time thats up to you we get requested protocols frequently by our userbase and if you dont have the time to work with us thats fine were not here to serve you were here to serve our user base i hope that makes this a little clearer thanks
330863,see how cvx clearly states it does not use timelocks we award points for this
330864,you should see if there is any correlation between hacked protocols and their ratings
330866,not sure if that helps or harms
330867,no such correlations should be drawn ever nobody is ever safe devving is hard we all need to protec each other
330868,if that function calls approve it doesnt matterthe way permissions work for erc20721 assets means that the approve call has to originate from your eoa address and not another contract
330869,you can not award points on whether the projects itself explains their design choices or not either you understand them and judge based on that or you dont unless you are somehow rating the communication efforts of the project
330870,pmriviere sorry that comment was too tinfoil info is here
330871,to be fair i did have to go a bit out of my way to explain stuff though which is what charlie is referring to
330872,so whats the point of those ratings then
330873,i wrote this a few months ago we dont draw conclusions we just bring the data to you to make your own decisions with id need to run the numbers again to make sure its still perfectly relevant
330874,similar to ico ratings i think good intentions can be there users respond to different criteria but just take it as raw info and dont look at a score
330875,i am not arguing w u charlie btw
330876,why drama redacted idk it probably matters for our wonderland friends
330877,generally speaking transparent code and good developer practises has a trend towards safer code in identifying what some of these practises might look like we can increase the number of eyes looking at code thereby making it more robust
330878,probably cause its just rumours
330879,as developers all of this stuff might seem fairly straightforward to youus but from an outsiders perspective its extremely confusing and virtually impossible to compare one protocol to another these scores are an attempt to bring some form of comparison
330880,instead of caring about if people got an allo or the guys that built it is it sound and solid does it work i guess we see
330881,yes i remember do you think jumping through the hoop was a valuable use of your time to explain how your multisig contracts works
330882,ye this is more what matters tbh and no there werent allos which are hidden which is transparent enough
330883,in bear even devs hate each other
330884,yes more hate more expose
330885,nan
330886,
330887,if the code is immutable im pretty sure it will be here for as long as fantom exists
330888,ahhh blast the secret is out
330889,i protected u a bit ser blz no rug
330890,whats the defirating on gearbox
330891,333333
330892,this
330893,sad when devs cannibalize each other in public its already hard enough with arm chair speculators hounding them
330894,gm looking thru sources regarding how to unbatch a merkle root tx its a diploma verification tx done by a university any suggestions where to exactly poke at in etherscan
330895,is high so i have to play nice mewny
330896,ours its 88 we worked together with ivangbi and 0xmikko good developer team very good preexisting documentation remarkable commitment to decentralisation and actual execution from the start
330897,hehe i know 3
330898,was poking fun
330899,this will make charlie_eth hate gearbox now although he already did
330900,few
330901,nan
330902,whyfud
330903,i was in fantom defi as user since sushi deployed and it started gaining traction there was a beautiful epoch where everything ran smoothly you payed 1 gwei and less than a second later you got your transaction donefast forward to now and im paying 19ftm for a 5k gwei transaction to go after x undetermined minutes in an invisible queue and you see people paying 10150k gwei for transactions every time that theres an use that resembles ethereumsthen people shifted to having big hopes of things getting fixed after fvm but when they say it will be 2 years and the charismatic coauthor of lachesis leaves and you add the state of ethereum getting better and better wellwrapping up people went into a promising escalable eth killer backed by a good dev when ethereum transactions were getting absurdly high and people leaving after said dev leaving when the network is showing that cant escalate its just a cherry on topthe same happened to polygon and they planned the merge with hermez which should go live this year and not even counting the existence of others like starknet etc that makes waiting for 2 years a minimum big leap of faith
330904,interesting thanks a lot ser
330905,cool name maybe you could help us read through all this or we stick to the irony
330906,1 cult left to kill terra fans
330907,andre daniele tetra etc have been poked i love them all except daniele the scammer coco shit but its factual people in those cult are with pitchforks just an observation and yes those people are retarded by default
330909,ser sunny please language
330910,do is hesitant to pay his employees my apologies
330911,dont forget the ada tiktok cult
330912,and sec write him love letters terra ded now
330913,many large projects have them this is nothing new not something to poke on or make fun of my man
330914,i assume they all fucking got rekt on options trading scams on robinhood retarded kids they got what they wanted
330915,i jest terra is a fantastic project that has rightfully earned its place w 2nd largest network tvl do is a visionary and tfl will upend the fabric of our economy should have been more clearly identified as sarcasm
330916,nan
330917,stableivan doesnt like the 20 apr
330918,might as well farm 100 then with peniscock stablecoin i am ofc being too mean but i subjectively dont buy into their ust model if you can borrow ust at a low rate to farm sure
330919,i will happily delete this if asked to as it is about solidly but not hype more or less looking for a larger brain explanation to invalidate my findingssuper low slippage and super low fees protocol for protocols use votes to direct emissions to lps use votes collect fees and bribes positive feedback loop lock solid to own share via ve33 the low slippage and low fees protocol for protocols should lead to high volumes which complete the positive feedback loop totally get it and love ithowever votes for pools at snapshot direct emissions but immediately after snapshot i can move my votes to any pool i want and start accruing bribes in real time doesnt this effectively break the positive feedback loop since bribes are not locked for voters at snapshot if not totally breaking positive feedback loop it sure renders bribes irrelevant in terms of having an influence on votes for snapshot and lets everyone and their grandma goobble up all the bribes without actually voting for emissions for this pool
330920,
330921,so in this case no one would actually use the built in bribing system
330922,i know alot of people in the crypto space doing this disgusting
330923,ye because the contract is basically flawed but immutable
330925,a complete implementation of the travel rule will prove to be difficult considering not every technology allows this particular information to be stored and transferred it would be much easier to set up a global register of identified addresses a procedure also used in banking
330926,mostly just pleb larps there have been a few blue prints over the years would ignore
330927,i hope so
330928,careful ivangbi do is gonna start appearing in your twitter as reply guyakshually
330929,i like consensus but how is it possible to vote for yourself on this contextthis is not ethical brantly should have abstainedindeed i am sorry to say but alexs narrative doesnt hold aka ppl delegated to him their own vote they could have redelegated to othersprobably the result wouldnt have been different but i would have liked to see those who delegated to vote on their own or to a party which supported brantly
330930,if its not ethical to vote for the option on your interests then voting as a concept is useless
330931,lol us presidents are televised voting for themselves every year
330932,agree in general lets say in another way more cynical its a boomerang
330933,gn fam spotted a cool concept twittercomofficer_ciastatus1500883735373402119
330934,i do not suggest using it though but worth mentioning in the guidegithubcomoffcierciacryptoopsecselfguardroadmap
330935,context missing ppl are deciding if you may leave or not you should not votebut more importantly president vote is 1 here theres delegation would have been different if the delegated votes was move to smone else who supported brantly or vote on their own
330936,thats what a presidential or congressional etc etc election is if there is an incumbent deciding if they leave or stay
330937,other way around during bull markets we bite eachothers heads of bear markets we try to become friends again
330938,hey who can tell me a little about the api from 1inchi want to approve a coin and i get back an big hexcodebut where i have to send these codewant to set a limit order i want to code in c with the nethereum libraryi hope you can help methanks in advance
330939,thanks for expanding i hope in web3 we can use improved mechanisms
330940,what are the possible downsides if its invisible ink
330941,only you yourself will tell someone about it or if someone is watching you
330942,youd definitely get drunk and tell people
330943,after they see it in a club due to strobe lights
330944,it seems ppl are taking for granted the transparency aspect of crypto governance focusing on the person who voted no in their own self interest a natural behaviour and to be expected in crypto rather than the abstainers for example this can only lead to more resentment and infighting a good case study in general
330945,if ppl dont like the system they built that allows individuals to vote for themselves then they can leave instead of the other way around
330946,ppl dont like that he voted for himself ppl dont like that other ppl still delegate to him geez maybe realize that ppl have different opinions and thats the whole point around governance
330947,does yearn still charge a 2 management fee i thought that was removed at some point
330948,yes they do
330949,thanks vpepo
330950,tattoo master lol i mean as a risk
330951,problem is that founders have too much voting power unless they do smth like gearbox
330952,definitely great case study i am not judging none honestly if ens reached is what it is we have to thank brantly and team they did an astonishing jobyou pointed out a good point with crypto governance we have better visibility and thats greatmy question is the mechanism working as expected thinking more about it if its not correct probably there will a governance vote to change the governance itself curious to see this kind of phenomenon in the case
330953,do you mean like generating boilerplate comment sections or actually documenting it for you as well
330954,gearbox is a great extreme example with its own tradeoffs pls unlock tokens sir ivan but for 99 projects out there to expect anything but the team still holding majority in the short term is also forcing a project into fall apart mode again tradeoffs everywhere
330955,all this extension is is 4 mustache templates and some parsing
330956,yessssss
330957,show me the study that shows democratic process leads to better outcomes
330958,how is the ppl that founded a project having the most say a bad thing ill never get the idea of building something to just give away voting rights
330959,mechanism imo is working as expected the mechanism use is arguable doing governance around how a system should function is v different from doing governance around what the people should or not do
330960,100
330961,its a good thing its bad to expect operating teams to give majority ownership to the community from the start i guess we agree
330962,i think we are in the corner case scenario the event occurred its difficult to plan
330963,100 youll up in solid situation where ppl with no invested determining rewards to pools where theyre the only holders
330964,what are other tools you can use to check sentiment and or ratificate a decision like that
330965,i think the problem is that boundaries between what team can do and what community can expect arent defined thus endless drama over devscommunity interests
330966,why no adversarial governance structure 13 multisig where 1 can update governance but its two phase conmit that can be revoked by 23
330967,thinking loudly not voting and make the decision wo the community in or out would have get the same result
330968,if the team has a stake in it wont that make them more willing to go the extra mile and keep long term value locks etc i dont get it
330969,100 to both yea one example that comes to mind is maker right after mcd launch the foundation still had a say over the protocol the community pressured to pass a few changes disagreeing with the foundation those changes almost caused the protocol to implode a few months later it is what it is
330970,ja thats raise me the question if its a problem of tools aka the current governance framework we have can express or catch this kind of situations
330971,community generally equals 3 or 4 whales that were friends and family of team that got in super early so its founders vs whales not much community involved
330972,what community
330973,so you point out that initial distribution could have been fairer
330974,chilling in discord and posting memes does not make community
330975,think of this trauma as a team building exercise
330976,this is a good source of inspiration was correct to not implode too early for giving away tokens
330977,you are now more of a community having gone through this than had you not
330978,i think no matter the distribution itll end up being whales vs founders in the end 95 of community will have 5 of voting power
330979,spoiler i am doing so many questions because i am thinking about the governance of the protocol we are building your feedback is relevant for me and want to disavow biasesbeliefs
330980,why are you assuming governance model of capital vote
330981,it was about a timelock i think protocol was too young still so it was important to act fast and fix production bugs if any appeared it was mostly ct doing a fud campaign about centralization bla bla pressuring for a change then a few months later black thursday happened 0 bids etc there was a need to act fast to fix the liquidation system was not possible people lost money rest is history
330982,could not be wrong in general are you arguing the contrary
330983,concentration is inevitable
330984,i remember i didnt make the association so in retrospect better to have the control somehow
330985,thats just physics
330986,nothing is inevitable except death and taxes sir
330987,mmm you have constraints if you wantmost of the models outside are token you can transfer buy etci still believe theres a rainbow of governance mechanisms from the msig to buyable tokens
330988,yes progressive decentralization makes sense pplcommunity are impatient greedy and think they know more than they actually do about how protocols works sometimes they think they know better than the devteam that created the system devteam always gets blamed if things goes bad anyway
330989,sure you can have constraints but thats the thing about inevitability itll still happen
330990,centralization system is more efficient
330991,in the end we are ppl no matter the forms we are still in the phase users are customer you as owner is the blameable
330992,we are getting circular now
330993,how to solve make it illegal to be rich make it illegal to be poor make it illegal to sell make it illegal to buy
330994,ahahah 1 great chattingwhat about yfi still under 20k
330995,muh familia needs to circulate some gear soon ser pls must disrupt the dao model
330996,here you comrades go an excellent piece by phill daian on governance
330997,none of the issues discussed here are new examine the literature etc etc
330998,good pointer also this
330999,a random dude once saidcommunity is bullshit so my theory was as follows if someone has the token it is in their best interest to do whatever they can to increase the value of their token how naive i was and i guess this is partly our own fault as a defi community for calling it governance tokens because all people want to do is govern but not in the trenches helping fight instead on their throne as a dictator simply shouting orders while their plebian developers need to execute they dont care about your protocol they dont care about you and would just as soon sell that token when they no longer think you are contributing enough by their standards not them you they wont try to add value but they will be happy spending endless hours of your time asking you for updates and for you to explain in detail your thought processes and endless back and forth on the most pointless menial topics governance and community kill innovation and development dont do it
331000,governance i am convinced is mediated suicide by web3
331001,yes thank you emo andre for that insightful diatribe
331002,good thing that guy stopped making daos after that article
331003,lol he did say something about masochism
331004,the problem with governance is your using web1 ways of creating proposals there is no modeling done etc no one benchmarks their proposals excluding gauntlet network ofc
331005,cannot not answer its only the perspective of the builder i agree for the consequences but strongly believer that natural tensions between parties must exist and are the key for good things
331006,but even more so
331007,all of these systems presume a trained market
331008,these governance systems do not have trained actors in it
331009,eg stock market is a trained market
331010,the market for governance proposals for some randy dao is not quite as sophisticated or developed hence lends itself to gaming etc
331011,you want chess players in your governance market
331012,the problem with governance in crypto is people think you can squeeze out democracy from something with the dna of a plutocracy
331013,what you got was kids playing tic tac toe
331014,then they get surprised when it ends up as a plutocracy and then we go again lets pile up more things on top repeat
331015,someone read the article i posted
331016,inb4 real governance has yet fo be tried
331017,teddywoodward ser so when i lp i can only redeem at the expiration time is that so1 do i get lp tokens representation i can sell back into the pool if so even if the liquidity is quite low then i would assume which is totally fine as is2 are lp tokens received if there are can be used for something else like collateral somewhere
331018,just boilerplate i built something myself based on some library i found now it always surprises me how immature the tooling for blockchain development is compared to traditional development also in terms of reflection basedsmart code refactoring
331019,hey ivangbi you can redeem at maturity and if you lend to march or june you can exit early whenever you want if you lend to the december maturity there will be a three month period between march and june where you wont be able to exit early1 when you lend you get back fcash tokens you can sell these fcash tokens back to the liquidity pool for cash that is how you exit early if the size of your loan is much larger than the liquidity in the pool you might have trouble exiting early but you can always redeem at maturity just fine no matter the size2 fcash can be used as collateral on notional so you could borrow the same currency or a different currency on notional against your fcash we are also currently working with a few other protocols to take fcash as collateral notably when fiat dao launches you will be able to mint fiat against your fcash collateral
331020,sup any oil synths anywhere
331021,mirror
331022,muso yeah anything else available
331023,synthetix is going to relaunch soil but thats all i know
331024,whats your concern with muso
331025,when nickel synths
331027,terra
331028,do you pronounce that soil or s and oil
331029,s pause oil
331032,the problem with dgov is people have forgotten the tech is supposed to scale coordination at scale if we cant create functional systems then the tech doesnt work
331033,id argue it works but the social habits are still not integrated
331034,you should look at radspec fyi
331035,for all the amazing defi wizards here whats do you guys think is next big wave for defi
331036,gearbox
331037,fixed income leaders
331038,considering blockchain development itself as a field is younger than vscode its not that surprising every bit of good tooling that exists has been iterative
331039,options are my bet but im not even a wizard learning
331040,yeah more sophisticated defi trading vehicles should be a good bet
331041,something we are building
331042,when token ser
331043,thx ser looks cool
331044,edufi
331045,synthetic markets compared to tradfi we havent touched it yet
331046,rwa on defi but that might be too far out still
331047,actually working with one of those rn theyre closer than you think
331048,one got a maker loan a couple months ago
331049,also working on this once we launch we will also arrange a collab with lobsters
331050,all of us were working on same thing nice
331051,i hope our evm preference are different at least
331052,thats more of an emotional statement than saying decentralized governance is impossible it just means we have a long way to go still both protocolwise and culturallysocially
331053,it is not that decentralized governance is impossible its just not the right fit for most projects and models people try to force it onto these days governance just has become a good way to justify having a token without having to do anything else for or with it so you have a lot of mismatches
331054,zaki reversal seems like the issue is fixed
331055,perhaps but as far as statements go decentralized governance has been little more than hopeful statements about how adding blockchain into the mix somehow solves something
331056,can ask details how that loan happens
331057,imo one of the main issues in governance is lot of those models are based on how rfcs work in open source projects but in most of these cases that does map well to governance where serious economic incentives are involved
331060,i am not in favor of synthetic markets trading the crypto index pegged to financial indexes are just another way of derivatives of derivatives which usually ends up with crisis as mortgage loan backed aaa rated derivatives
331061,what
331062,utterly false
331063,look at makerdao and compound
331064,makerdao has gotten governance correct mostly
331065,compound style governance seems to be the pattern to go forward with openzeppelin offers it in their library
331066,as it turns out you couldnt have picked two worse examples
331067,k
331068,yeah ive done some research on how their delegate system operates and it is a good example for the rest of defi hasu becoming a delegate is very exciting
331069,then again we probably have different ideas whether is correct
331070,the fuck do i care about their frontend
331071,its useful if the idea is to pretend the people that have a say is greater than the people that did before it was an out and out startup
331072,i dont think people should have a say
331073,the frontend is irrelevant the data is what is
331074,anyone know if there is a bot that lets discord members mint an nft directly from the discord server
331075,equality is for suckers
331076,maybe but shifting the goalposts after the fact is amusing to say the least
331077,why should someone joining late in the game be afforded the same weight as a person who was there day 1
331078,theres a name for that centuries old depending on how far back you want to go decentralized governance isnt it
331079,what goalposts
331080,fam turning into a bit of an endless back and forth now
331081,the federal reserve is a decentralized central bank
331082,tomato tomato
331083,this is getting too circular now sers you are both not fully wrong just with different ideology
331084,blz fin now this is not going anywhere sometimes i think coiner benevolent and sam r same
331085,
331086,lets get back to doom and gloom as a collective group not in fighting lol
331088,but we argue all the time
331089,nan
331091,devs arguing online
331092,babahahh this is the best tweet
331093,ahem
331094,
331095,wow you mean somebody working in crypto lied about their background
331096,if you dropped out of elementary school you dropped out of a path to a phd
331097,please tell me youre not defending him
331098,literally just had to have an uncomfortable 30 minute talk with normie friends about why charles is a scam
331099,nan
331100,what if i told you that charles isnt actually the founder of cardano but they hired him on as a mouthpiece because they needed a full time shill and they are happy to let him believe that
331101,
331102,tfw you actually dropped out of a phd and have no clue why someone would lie about thatbut really though is that somehow prestigious people in crypto dont care where you went to school or what you studied all about what you do here
331103,probably different now but cardano is technically from a time where you had ico scams that would scrape stock photos and label itexmsft exgoogle exapple 13 years experience
331104,yeah that makes sense still see those projects usually dont go too well
331105,january 2018how it started
331106,has an air of ha crypto is a joke i work at faang surely i can outdo everyone there
331107,that sounds like a conspiracy theory that eventually turns out to be true in some form
331108,what would you say about bitcoin and ethereum governance
331109,they are the most successful things in crypto at the moment perhaps regardless of governance although did they do something right
331110,i far prefer their lack of onchain governance no governance is the best governance is my stance on the matterof course elimination isnt practical for every project not everything is liquity or uniswap if we ignore that token but rather that than the rube goldberg pretendaos we have today
331111,dont governance tokens have a better chance at governing a project than company stock
331112,i dont see how thats possible excluding the implementationdetail blockchain element theyre identical in the best case worse otherwise because with stocks you have the identity of the people no im not saying thats a justification to start hosing peoples info to create better daos yet no one would honestly claim alphabet and friends are daos
331113,no phd pleb
331114,forever a lowly ms
331115,regulations will probably kill it
331116,poor hungry and pretty dumb
331117,hahaha im interested in hearing more
331118,who is the actual founder then
331119,cant be named
331120,
331121,danm i didnt know there was anyone named its in this world
331122,yep cardano shills in 2017 milked the phd gigabrain dev narrative
331124,jayeharrill hey qsp rugged
331125,alex is the new king
331126,what makes oasis protocol unique is it potential
331127,new financial instruments built on top of prediction markets
331128,
331129,
331130,could anybody connect metamask wallet with this
331131,i try on pc and mobile too but i couldnt
331132,
331133,exactly this ser
331134,in my opinion bridging tech as a infrastructure piece and options markets
331136,what really amazes me is how so many of these completely dead projects are still trading on cexs
331137,qsp and aion are two that come to my mind first but many others
331138,quantstamp is fine only the token is rekt
331139,lol qsp raising a new funding round
331140,nostalgia trading remind yourself of the euphoria of the good times
331141,
331142,
331143,nothing like trading 2017 coins for the ptsd feels
331144,just like ctk tokens dont have any related to the company
331145,my fav so far was the one raising for expanding their banana plantation
331146,not even a single mention of the token on their website its fucking hilarious i wonder how their lifetime community members are doing tempted to check out the tg group
331147,no shame exit didnt even bother to rebrand
331148,does quantstamp invest money in projects like a vc
331149,they only siphon money
331150,if you read their whitepaper they didnt even deliver their promise
331151,i am not sure if they invest in projects per se but they certainly ask for a hefty amount of tokens when auditing one almost like a vc
331152,hey anyone who is following coinmonks on twitter or medium they clearly promote scammers on their medium account they have a column where they promote signal groups which are clearly a pump and dump schema they used to be reasonable based on what i learned but either changed their minds and grabbed some quick or just sold to someone they wanted to publish my medium article so i took a look into them and found out what they do would be happy if you unfollowed them as by following them you are increasing their credibility both on twitter and medium
331153,hey ivangbi am i allowed to post a defi job here people may be interested in looked through the rules but they didnt mention this
331154,just saw job board never mind
331155,
331156,ty for the lobster perk and congrats on the raise nick
331157,thanks
331158,true this off late a project i know was asked 250k worth of tokens at the seed round price of 10m this in addition to don ho being an angel investor in that round
331159,they dont display the score anymore
331160,check the link leaderborad is remained
331161,
331162,does anyone know alternative it does work anymore
331167,is there any website that display the amount and unlock time of cvx and crv
331170,cvx
331171,who did we cancel last night
331173,thanks but this is not all the unlock right
331174,
331175,yes it is this was the previous unlocking schedule but everything got unlocked at once some day ago due to a bug in the contract
331176,alright thanks didnt know that
331177,so currently only 1 user locked his cvx
331178,my money is on aaaaaaa being that user
331179,nope its aggregated by unlocking date
331180,damn
331182,if youre interested in cvx new contract data i created a dashboard last weekendsponsoredbybadger
331184,known russians with vpns
331185,how lol whats the point to use coinbase if you cant use it for onoff ramp
331186,russians with dollars
331188,i dont know a single russian using coinbase they are just spreading retarded hysteria even broader
331189,there is 0 point to use them
331195,please less blabla be factual redacted whatever is above is fine
331214,thank you charlie_eth u beat me
331215,hi i want to do some analysis on sandwich attack on dunebut how do i define them is there any existing dune dashboard queries that i can learn from
331219,you may wanna try this

331227,
331228,unionpayjcb issued cards should work fine abroad i assume try wwwgazprombankruuploadfilesiblockf6atarifpuuniversalnyy_0603pdf bank or wait several days tinkoff will start issuing them soon
331229,true id also presume debit cards like wisedukascopy are also going to work no problems in israel atm so wont be able to try or comment firsthand
331237,did saddle finance forked curve
331238,yeah was a whole thing about licensing back in the day
331239,afaik curve is built by vyper so saddle forked the curve amm and implemented it using solidity
331240,i honestly cant remember at this point if it was originally in vyper and then ported over as a getout clause or if they reimplemented and launched with it but i recall there being a distinct barney about what was covered in a license with curve getting a lot of shit about licensed defi code
331241,
331242,ive just realised im wearing my rekt shirt
331243,the frog chimes in when called apparently
331244,yeh
331248,guys why using blocktimestamp in the contract considered vulnerability sometimes eli5
331249,this is because it can be manipulated by miners to some extent
331250,is there a technical limit to how many addresses usdc might blacklist
331251,no
331252,2160
331268,someone nuked that whole chat whilst i was in the middle of nuking it another staged bot
331270,no mercy
331271,is there a jira alternative for crypto that many most builders in the space prefer or use to manage the whole company remotely not just the development
331273,i dont think so
331274,clickup is great tho
331275,have you tried this service sir wwwwonderversexyz
331276,both of my other companies run on jira and trello traditional startups so not familiar with anything else but would much rather pick what every web3 devs are most familiar with for my new project ill check out wonderverse and clickup thanks
331277,only a vulnerability if your timing needs to be exact to within 30 seconds if youre using a lockup that doesnt need that kind of precision eg vesting then blocktimestamp is safe to use
331278,wwwclarityso also did smth cool for task management
331279,is wonderverse more focused on making daos work or is the actual project management side equally good as something like clickup most of the team will start out being paid traditionally so dont necessarily need a lot of the dao related functionality
331280,sweet will check that out too thanks
331281,just osinted this service githubcomhatskierdrello but seems their domain is expired
331282,financial nfts are going to be a big component of nextgen architectures expect them to become a very common way to make uiux portable to the point that you see actual dappsthat is to say that live ui embedded within nfts is a very easy and obvious way to streamline getting positions off proprietary marketplaces and into universal erc7211155 marketplaces
331283,deworkxyz maybe
331284,people use notion usually
331285,oh really ive used notion before but didnt feel like itd be super helpful for project product management stuff
331286,at yearn we use linear
331287,chainlink powered algo funds triggered by fundamentals changes in dex tokens tlvprice ratio
331288,i believe a self hosted version of notion exists but i pay for notion to support the dev after msft ripped him
331289,clickup def seems like the closesst to what im looking for so far
331290,yep many builders use it i use notion as personal agenda but in crypto widely popular
331291,awesome yeah thats more along the lines of what i was looking for is linear common in the space
331292,maybe i dont know how to use it right when i used it it seemed to have none of the functionality youd want for managing an org
331293,hmmm not sure but its clearly better than notion imho
331294,
331295,you can check templates here me and my team are using traditional solutions but l really like notion i think one of founder was also in that group
331296,they were crypto friendly guys
331297,ah good old days
331298,cbdcs being passed will inadverntly and unintentionally cause this india introducing cbdcs next year will be the biggest onboarding of new people to crypto 15b people 6 of global economy post currency turns into cbdc wont be too long for land and property you own to turn into an nft in your govt assigned wallet its the perfect use case if we figure out how to wrap that out or take it off the countrys chain next step in defi is here not sure itll be the next one but yeah these financial nfts will be massive for adoption
331299,assuming a cbdc central bank digital currengy will be crypto which seems doubtful unless india has signalled otherwise
331300,feelsgoodbropngwe make modular systems for them excited to see what the future holds future of defi is simplified ux most people dont have the brainpower to remember what farm they deposited into 6 months ago much less how to use a block explorer wrap their position into an fnft suddenly they can just check everything in one spot
331301,that all said hope cbdcs arent the catalyst for this thats kinda like winning a fight because your opponent had a heart attack
331302,india already has one of the best digital banking protocols most of the south east asian countries do too i dont see the central government shifting from that to a blockchain based currency all cbdcs would do is cut out the middleman cash when the reserve bank needs to infuse more money into the economy
331303,if these cbdcs can be wrapped as erc20s with canonical versions the possibilities are endless it will behave probably like a stable coin with the ability to blacklist and freeze on the flip side it could create new onboarding channels that will be like hoses pumping users
331304,yeah have called it crypto and blockchain based have to wait and see what they introduce but larger point is this will be the first time majority of indian users will experience digital money in their own custodyatleast on perception india has amazing fintech but this will take it a step ahead what financial products they then use it in will be a nice base level understanding for actual decentralised crypto is not immediately but over term well see a good movement
331305,the country that does take their currency off chain and actually decentralises it could have the chance to grow massively will dump usdt for a decentralised inrd or whatever in a second
331306,because non digital currencies cant
331307,the ramp creation to do it on chain and the process rn isnt strong enough though
331309,in feb they announced a blockchain based currency
331310,
331311,could someone tell me why singlesided dai has 27 apy on bancor what am i missing thx
331312,in the same breadth where the governor for reserve bank said that there should be a blanket ban on all crypto currencies and the announcement just said they are evaluating blockchain and other techs for it not that it will use blockchain for sure dunno it just seems a bit far fetched to think that the same body of government that wants to ban cryptocurrencies will introduce an open blockchain based currency that can interact with other chains
331313,decentralised inrdwhat does a cbdc have to do with decentralization
331317,yeah which is why i dont expect the inrt or whatever to be decentralised but blockchain based has been confirmed
331318,has been like this for all the stable 1sided pools on bancor for a good while since apy is so high and their il protection over time is great almost impossible to get in tho
331319,you didnt see all of their plans yet
331320,nan
331322,this is literally screaming you gonna pay to amazon service to listen to the birds singing
331325,if its not decentralised why use a blockchain might as well use git and excel sheets
331326,recruitement of people self custody of digital assets and understanding why its important is still lost on most
331327,recruitment of people for how does a cbdc where cb means central bank help with self custody and understanding
331328,i mean people are using solana so
331329,recruitment of people to decentralised technology
331330,thats nice what part of cbdc helps with that
331331,there arent any noncustodial digital wallets rn that arent decentralised cbdcs with all their negatives bring the understanding of this to people as well
331332,that is not going to happen
331333,sorry didnt know all world leaders told you they dont want to give citizens country issued digital wallets that help the country see and control all the citizens assets
331334,not even the people in crypto care that much about the negatives of youre telling spongebob on the street is going to see a cbdc thats practically indistinguishable from the digital money theyve been using and start caring about actually decentralized currency
331335,ser self custody decentralisation seaparate things we are talking about
331336,self custody of digital assets will be a first time experience for most citizens in a country that introduces cbdcs
331337,the internet is going to make everyone a programmer
331338,your claim is even more absurd than that
331339,fintech in india is insane but still no self custody wallets
331340,okay we can agree to disagree self custody is a big deal to me not to you thats fine
331341,whats the need to self custody gov issued assets
331342,ser youre claiming cbdc will make normal people care about selfcustody because no reason whatsoever
331343,the gov issued asset is national currency its the same as saying why do we need a web3 wallet if we can keep tokens on binance
331344,that is literally the opposite of what i was asking but okay
331345,because mitigation of risk from banks ability to use money at any timebanks are restrictive holidays weekends daily timings easier to follow transactions and differentiated new financial services they will have access to more freely
331346,its the same reasons why we keep a part of our money in web3 wallets
331347,lol
331348,while those wallets can be controlled by the govt
331349,the perception will largely be that people control it
331350,this from a normal person
331351,im not sure you understand how non custodial wallets work i apologize if i sound rude here
331352,this is largely the perception by most noncrypto people rn yeah sadly govt psyops are real
331353,i dont think govt psyops is the problem here
331354,err how
331356,summary cbdc where cb means central bank will make normal people suddenly care about self custody in order to mitigate risks from banksokay
331357,ye idk what you are arguing ser mugglesect either
331358,did yall know one of the first uses for the printing press was in printing indulgences still killed the power of the catholic church in the long runcrypto and cbdcs are that exact scenario nearly a thousand years later
331359,they didnt have the ability to rug your writing from under you at the click of a button so exact same is being incredibly generous
331360,not intentionally no ser but if as an avg citizen i now had a digital wallet that didnt restrict my transactions basis holidays and timings like banks doindian banks are terrible at this ill self custody some of my money and understand the point of it
331361,it doesnt matter if they introduce cbdcs because ultimately their system is less efficient the soviet union had a thriving black market in exchanging rubles with dollars you cant fight gravity
331362,if anything is similar it would be chinas alipay and friends
331363,upi doesnt shut down on weekends neither does internet banking
331364,i dont even know when was the last time i was inside a physical bank
331365,300 limit on upi though
331366,i now had a digital walletaverage citizen couldnt care lessill self custodyser i feel like you dont know what the cb in cbdc means
331367,yeah but you are an entirely different part of the society i work in an fmcg company 2b business most of the transaction received by our distributors are cash they dont deposit till they absolutely have to to ensure cash stays with them this is pretty common ability to have self custody of this without banks is a huge space
331368,i have never faced that issue infact i have daily transactions that go far above that without issues maybe a bank specific limit but even then what makes you think that similar limits wont be there on a protocol by the central government
331369,there is a very particular reason why many of those businesses are cash heavy and i dont see any incentives for them to jump on to a protocol that is centralized can go down anytime and has more government control leaving behind trusty old cash
331370,unless they are absolutely forced to because the government wants to force the protocol onto them
331371,this is pepsi coke nestle cant evade tax post gst easily on the contrary they want to get rid of cash based operations because its an expense and massively trust based average for our business last year for cash handling was 2 for a business thats about 15b cash based 2 is massive
331372,lobsterdao holders get to participate in dex guru governance and future guru tokens details here
331373,paytm and the likes arent trusted self custody for business owners who handle multiple cash transactions daily is neededbangalore distributor association actually had a whole session on this4050b turnover combined and the response was insanely positive
331374,thats when i saw slight hope in the shit show cbdcs largely will be
331375,
331378,why is dao rate so much higher than usdc rate niemerg
331379,seeing that persist over a few markets while convrersion is 11 really
331380,maybe its because dai has less liquidity
331381,nan
331382,thats just 03 right
331383,i meaning borrowing liquidity
331384,ye curious why nobody is stepping in seems like free yield
331385,although people are locked in for those durations then and they dont want that
331386,i was just acting on ur tweet to ape big into notional and then use ftokens on yield potentially
331387,teddywoodward cc
331388,we are still setting it up to make that work hoping to launch next week
331389,we are gonna try every way we can think of to turn our low rates into free alpha
331390,for any lobsters in the nyc area
331391,
331392,please drop in
331393,cant speak for the future but presently 4 mil salvadorans choose to use govt chivo wallet
331394,
331395,somebodys got to do it ivan definitely look forward to this
331396,cbdcs next year onwards sure will be one fun era
331397,yeah thats pretty much whats guaranteed to happen
331398,selfcustody doesnt even register as a thing much less a concern
331399,
331400,relevant to cbdcs
331401,530000 venezuelans use reserve appwallet and transact in rsv
331402,naisu
331403,btw if i lped back in the days to gib ntokens liquidity at a high 20 rate organic then was like 8 would i technically be rekt now i know that is lping and not lending but when lping there at such a rate i am taking a hit then that the rates have gone down its like buying fixed income at a high rate no
331404,ser you literally just agreed people will use govt wallets i am saying these wallets will enable people to experience our noncustodial wallets and explain the point of owning your assets which can lead to movement to crypto called them selfcustodial should have probably said noncustodial didnt because govts will probably have thr choice to control them thus blurring the terminology
331405,you realize chivo is custodial right
331406,you realise 60 of the population uses it when they realise they want to own their assets they move to web3
331407,thats exactly what i am saying
331408,most cbdc wallets will be custodial but will enable people to see the point
331409,wich they currentky dont because they dont even try it out
331410,so what youre saying is a thing that hasnt happened with a noncbdc will magically happen with a cbdc
331411,i thought was bad enough
331412,wow
331413,the government is heavily incentivized to prevent people from seeing the point either through heavy regulation or through propaganda
331414,someone mentions cbdc 4 hours later
331415,yes but a good percent does see through it when you do it for 15billion people it will lead to movement to noncustodials wallets as well for those who do
331416,thats what i said
331418,meh this conversation is a circle of nothingness cbdc from ui going to be pretty much the same as what people already using its not going to be pushing people to self custody any more than they are from bank apps alipay wechat etc its fine to think so but just saying you think so over and over again seems kind of useless
331419,
331420,de fuk
331421,perhaps starting unjustified witch hunts against contributors wasnt such a good idea after all
331422,u surprised
331423,i thought dame tried to cancel everyone
331424,boomerang headshot
331425,
331426,finally some bullish charts
331427,still better uptime than some l1s
331428,the canceloooor is cancelled
331429,its not just me experiencing discord issues now then
331430,maybe a side effect on this would be rainbow being cancelled and losing share of their user base though call
331431,
331433,nah you would have been fine ntokens can experience a little il because they do get long or short rates as rates move but the effect is pretty small even with the very large move in interest rates that weve seen since launch for example weve been lping since day 1 and our organic return not counting token incentives is currently sitting at about 3 annualized even with the large initial rate volatility
331434,is there anything i need to consider when i want to start learning python on a macbook
331435,nah
331436,
331437,yes massive down of discord twitter youtube etc
331438,expecting some hit me up when youre building web3 discord messages on twitter now
331439,
331440,someone ballsed up dns somewhere i bet
331441,inb4 cyber attack
331442,but its something mundane and stupid
331443,is this the end
331444,yes no more dao coordination on discord and no more banging tunes on your sonos via spotify
331445,feels like the end of times
331446,mike was just in a shitty position in this situation would have hated to be in his shoes
331447,can anyone recommend software that visualizes wallet interaction with other wallets
331448,see full thread sir
331449,also githubcomoffcierciadefideveloperroadmaptransactionvisualizationscoringtracking
331450,discord is back up and running the daos are saved
331451,it wasnt cloudflare
331452,thank god i dont have to go outside
331453,it was a google load balancer it seems
331454,curatetoearn new interesting conceptps i was thinking tcr is dead already
331455,tcrs are back oh my
331456,feels like we are in early 2018
331457,
331458,my bags feel like end of feb 2018
331459,not yet we need prediction markets back too
331460,tcrs have a user problem especially heading into the bear
331461,but the engineering could be set and it could work in tandem with the eventual return of social tokens imo
331462,and prediction markets
331463,all suffer from the general crypto user problem
331464,they are more web3 products then money makers
331465,almost agree
331471,hi all were do you staking coins maybe someone knows staking aggregator
331472,depends on what youre staking
331473,bnb avax bico on okex many coins do you know service were whos aggregate offers for staking
331474,yieldyak beefy finance pickle offer aggregation
331475,thank you
331476,you can add yieldwolf and autofarm to that list i think adamant too
331477,alpaca finance as well with leverage is optional
331479,does anybody have a script to importexport metamask accounts via private key including the account name
331480,its super ridiculous that when i switch computers there is no easy way to transfer my metamask
331481,copypaste into evernote is the thing to do
331482,ian balina jokes aside the evernote solution isnt even interesting you gotta do it manually for all your accounts wtf
331483,
331492,
331493,does anyone know who is behind mev bot 0xa57
331494,what kinda solutions do you guys use for hotwallets say for servers the monitor contracts control bridges mev bots
331495,flashboy telegram or discord might know
331497,i mean what solutions are used to hold the private key for say an mev bot exchange hot wallets and so
331498,does anyone know reliable p2p or at least kycless fiatoff ramp in indonesia looks like for 20m crypto users with ru passport all centrazlied exchanges and centrazlied assets in the near future are closed for good
331499,what about localcryptoscom
331500,this or check binance p2p market
331501,
331502,redacted from official sources
331507,it depends who you go with how many contracts and how complex it is so it can range
331508,lmao at bain crypto having to apologize for having a team of white and asian men
331509,i hate this world
331510,hope paradigm chads never have to capitulate like that
331511,nothing wrong with employing the biologically more logical and intelligent gender
331512,cmon guys lets end it here thank you i agree with the fact it should be clear to everyone that no one should be ashamed of nationality and apologise for it
331518,not really as each prices it different just hit some up for quotes and see then negotiate from there
331519,sure weve been in close contact with them happy to relay input maia is addressing some of the setbacks andre had in his original solidly to put the safety of the community and quality of the product first such as consolidating a list of all bugs witnessed in solidly and their fixes mostly ui some minor to the minter contract to fix emission decay and due to the emissions in andres original solidly after a few months maia has decided to raise emissions by 20 now 5 to match curves biweekly emissions of 1by addressing these setback it gives maia the opportunity to be the solidly fork that addresses what went wrong in the original launch bringing higher tvl over the metis emission start in hermes protocol will begin march 10
331527,i think theyre an optimisim fork
331529,noice check dm pls
331531,hi giga brain sers this thread has struck my mind would be good to have your thoughts on luna
331532,couple good senior developers were asking around 5000 l highly recommend ask advices from muditg or samczsun
331534,tier 1 audit firms are charging 40kengineerweek and still have an year long waitlist tier 23 charge anywhere from 5kengineerweek to 20k
331535,the thread is complete bs not a ponzi anymore than bitcoin and especially compared to usd edit to elaborate i dont mean to compare pegged vs unpegged simply that the classic definition of ponzi doesnt apply here
331536,may l ask do you audit by yourself it was one of the thing l wonder about you
331537,for 2000 loc it can range from 40k to 180ktier 1 and for tier 1 you mostly have to wait months for a slot
331538,i do but dont have any availability right now
331539,you are god tier so l expect there is a longer waitlist
331540,bitcoin does not claim to be stable
331541,
331542,aww thanks ser
331543,didnt know that was a prequisite to be a ponzi
331544,i was just going through their tvl 19b out of total 22b is anchor or liquid staking people call anchor to be a ponzi itself giving 20 fixed on stables what if everyone starts to redeem their ust for luna and then sell luna to usdt if luna starts losing value dont you think the whole ecosystem will fall offsimilar to like if everyone starts going to withdraw their money from bank usd ponzi falls though usd standard wont be so easy to fall off coz thats protected by states but lunaust standard is still very new and just probably need a black swan event or when vcs panic sell their 100x bags
331545,that is the argument yes but believers say they will come up with new utility sinks so far only 90 just farming and thats where the conversation ends there hasnt been anything new on the ust front i am personally in the boomer camp like monet too but there are enough people in the other camp its all about believing and changing elasticity idk so unless there is something new i would suggest to not continue this convo further because there is not much to discuss
331546,nothingburger as always good
331550,there has been some new innovation on the ust front specifically alice as an example
331551,terra fan here but isnt alica just a simplified normie ux for anchor
331552,if you ever quote certik next to questions of security that is an immediate red flag to just literally ban you no certik is one of the worst auditor s anyway other names on your list are good chainsecurity sigmaprime mixbytes etc
331553,it does nothing to incentivise lending balance the treasury
331554,making an app doesnt mean much so far entire crypto is whale ponzi games but ye an app makes believers believe in ust peg is fine
331555,easier on off ramp with point of sale integration i view it as a venmo competitor
331559,this is correct in its current state but it wouldnt be a leap to expect more from their roadmap
331560,meh i think thats reaching if they onboard more people onto anchor then the treasure deletes alot quicker
331561,i could be wrong but i dont see alice really helping here
331562,and the interest rate drops a bit nbd
331563,the issue is that ser venmo competitor was used in pitch decks about one million times
331564,touche
331565,another way than going with an auditing company may be an audit competition like just found out about it yestday dont know much about it
331568,youre funny ser
331569,are you from alice mr
331570,they are adding a forex reserve to be better prepared for a black swan event
331573,
331576,zokyo is good too
331578,auditors with reputation dont engage in such open things they simply have no time its more so for devs tinkering with code and kinda bug bounty hunters
331580,what do cscryptography academics mean if they complain about ethereum tooling
331581,thats a positive thread by the way
331583,would say yes and yes
331584,lots of noise as well though in the reports
331585,thank you ser
331586,very important viewpoint will give a shot
331587,ye same as any bug bounty but cant not do it
331588,i would guess working on the node clients having an easy setup to test changes and just jump in and test it out
331589,whatever you do make sure you setup your dmarc
331590,mostly that they cant fathom how producing good tooling based on an entirely new collaboration model which is being worked out in parallel with product development itself can take a bit of time
331591,the guy addresses that in the thread directly
331592,is there a handy twitter thread of projects that currently using or plan to use vetokenomics
331593,lmao did you get that too dd defi is so far away from all that stuff that ye we had that too
331594,even though everyone knows it
331595,yeah immunefi doesnt allow it but they still get on the dms
331596,another great overview by blocmates this time on potion
331597,hey degens im trying to create a child contract inside the factory contractchild contract size is around 23kb and factory contract size is much over than 24kbis there anyway to overcome this issue
331598,we got azuro
331599,why do all prediction market start with a
331600,predictability
331601,poly market
331603,i love when people call a thread that goes against their bags bs and then proceed to compare a pegged coin with an unpegged coin notice that usd is not a pegged coin whilst ust is of course the general logical capacity of people in this space is below an average elementary school class hilarious
331604,suggest to mute someone like this for a while who consistently puts out misleading and low quality comments
331605,id say that its more around the fact that the likelihood for a bank run on the usd is very low as it is widely accepted everywher and growth is organicwhereas ust has grown a lot and mostly due to huge unsustainable apy figures the forced adoption here is the issue leverage against mim looped apy etctechnically ust will probably stay on peg or return to it pretty fast but a bank run can harm the price of luna horribly
331606,both have mechanisms for stability they are different obivously as ust aims to track the precise value of usd and the usd aims to be relatively stable
331607,just different pegging mechanisms i assume u r referring to usdc and not usd
331608,nope im referring to usd
331609,read the message i was replying to
331610,ah ok i assume he was referring to the fact there can be a bank run on any asset including usd the ust ponzi bankrun meme seems to be the new usdt unbacked meme its held up ok through some heavy drawdowns of course theres a risk but theres a risk with anything
331611,the point is that usd holders are after stabilityust holders are after unsustainable apyso if indeed anchor cant sustain the 20 apy we might see a huge bank run and its hard to predict the outcomepretty sure thats the gist of the story
331612,just because you can on some level call nearly everything a ponzi doesnt mean that ponzi a ponzi b and then use that as argument to call another line of arguments bs its a low quality comment with no nuance and no content all of this guys comments are like that get rid of him
331613,enough please there were not really new arguments after this fin
331614,there is a difference between asking low quality questions and giving low quality comments
331615,the former is much more okay than the latter if you aim for an open high quality chat room
331616,there will be no bankrun because theres no bank to run to to contract ust supply youre incentivised to burn ust to mint luna the convergence of market caps of these assets will maintain the peg luna liquidity is deep af able to take on ms of market sell orders just a nothingburger discussion
331617,thats true ye makes sense
331618,and another one answering the concern what happens when sell orders come in in the bs by explaining that the liquidity can easily stomach sell orders in the ms d
331619,just for context ust market cap compared to 1 year ago has gone up x17 from 800 million to 14 billion
331620,
331621,did you enable optimisation on solc compilier that will usually chop off a few bytes or else try to break the factory contract into modules sire
331622,responsible innovation
331623,anything over 3 apy is a crime
331624,thats a good one ahaha
331625,more like innovation is a crime
331626,i thought someone said that giving low quality comments was less okay if the aim was to have high quality chat rooms you really think that there will be sell orders of bs without any buy pressure think of the magnitude of volume that the mms behind luna do and their bags in may luna fell 75 and saw its mcap below ust mcap and the peg got to 96c different numbers much more scarier now but the point still stands the market can efficiently react to these events again nothingburger with 0 value add comments as sprinkles
331627,ok fin
331628,guys can anybody explain me one thing like i understand what erc in say erc 20 or 721is but what does the number 20 or 721 define i mean yeah they are the standards but was there any logic behind those numbers since they cant be completely random right any resource on this
331629,clone factories
331630,literally enumeration
331631,so it is just random or is it that they keep going on sequentially but those that finally become standards are the one commercialized
331632,look at the underlying eip youll probably find clues there
331633,everything that launches originates in an eip submission
331635,very similar to how good ol rfcs and status work
331636,serial number to enumerate eips
331637,why do you think that it in crypto we wont have a new elite
331638,we already do but is much much more open anyway sorry that convo is political fugezi meh
331639,why will the world not get better or wannabe stuff lets not
331641,using examples from a prolonged reflexive upside scenario to predict what might happen in a prolonged reflexive downside scenario is a logical fallacyalso notice that if the same fraction of supply would be net sold today as was net sold in may then youre indeed talking about a net selling pressure in the bs
331642,is trustswaps vestingasaservice the best for linear vesting of an erc20 token
331643,why would a third party service be better than having complete control over the vesting in your own code would imagine trustswap will be taking a cut of your tokens too to provide this
331644,its free apparently and i assume audited

331656,here we go again
331657,its larp would delete
331660,no idea i just trust laura she cross check sources i heard
331661,ah well doesnt say anything pretty doubtful its sia idk lets move to nft_avenue if anywhere
331662,yes wanna google how many ppl were reinforcing the snoop is medici back when that happen its not a good look
331663,feedback on this
331664,arrow up
331665,lets agree that if this is a fake sia lauras whole book is biased and wrong
331667,nah i think this association is lame tbh her book is good and that tweet is unfortunate both are ok
331668,1 shes an incredible journalist
331669,jk i m a fan of laura
331670,i just hope the influencers we respect and trust stop enabling this kind of misleading marketing stunts
331671,
331672,whos the larp now
331673,who cares
331674,so we have snoop dog and sia now
331675,nope we just have more marketingsocial media management firms contracted by nft kols and are starting to understand that celebreties dont manage their own social media accounts
331676,wen oops my account was hacked
331677,web3 fixes this
331678,never its a semantically correct tweet since if you read sia bio it clearly states that the account is managed by a team
331679,the tweet feels more personal than that no feels different from snoop dog
331680,next week we could ls with commodities in snx
331681,managed sure but gives enough plausible deniability to claim the link to the honestly suspiciouslooking account was something something tweetdeck something got hacked if they ever needed to
331682,just yet another conversation about adoption but she s big for reference
331683,vs our top ct star
331684,this is why we cant have nice things
331685,no one cares
331686,fk celebrities
331687,fk 24hr news cycles that have nothing to talk about so they empower morons like this
331688,isnt mooncarl and bitboy our biggest most trusted stars
331689,look ill say this much crypto folks have bought out arenas in the us and sponsored teams football and cricket we are past the stage ofa celeb mentioning mattering
331690,adoption now is in building generational companies transferwise ig etc the space has evolved also why 50th random pool in 20th chain has become irrelevant rn obv market cycles play a role here but zoom out
331691,amen it only matters for retail frogs being boiled in extractive nft soups
331693,can you share this in a google sheets link
331694,yep
331695,thx just edit out the csv file now safer for everyone thanks for this
331696,hey lobsters i was curious to check which links in the group were posted more than once for education purposes and see what i might have missed turned out a great idea learned tons of new stuff sharing with you the result
331698,maybe they should spend more time making the eu work
331699,i actually think this is pretty bullish theyre scared of it but theyre even more scared of being followers instead of leaders some nft ponzi cleanup could do us good hopefully coincenter and uni embezzleeducation fund do their job
331701,cool yes
331702,
331703,i have lots of resources on my compendium and am always adding will make sure and add this to the directories and lists section
331704,isnt it has a same impact as creating any new token as eth gov token and organize snapshot voting for anythingimho it has same effect as web3 voting on the eth forumi mean the whole story here is legitimacy and influence power on eth devsminers from those who are token holders also not sure that such token must be liquid in any way transfersdex esinteresting read anyway
331705,if im launching a defi protocol no admin keys fully decentralized from day 1 tokens fairly distributed is there a service that would allow me to host the frontend so that i dont have to take liability for operating the service dont need to think about regulatory stuff or sanctions but would still be reliable for users in that they can trust theres no modification to the code to steal fundsinsert malicious code in any form basically outsourcing the hosting does handshake arweave ipfs solve it
331706,ipfs
331707,
331708,will it ever go up again mathematically speaking
331709,ipfs alone would require some nodes to pin the content else no node stores any data afaik cloudflare and other centralized cdns are the most popular nodes pinning content how do you recommend ipfs nodes are incentivized werent arweave and filecoin going to solve this
331710,they are but no real codebuilts examples yetalso very interesting in such topic
331711,essentially is there a good example of this being done are uniswap and yearn frontends available that are actively used in this format
331712,another question how youll manage domain without such responsibility
331714,i had written handshake in my original q never used handshake my assumption was it allows uniswapeth to redirect to the arweave store
331715,although no idea how sslhttps works in that case
331716,mathematically speaking its not a great reserve currency anymore
331717,spheron might help you setup a build and deploy process currently they deploy to arweave and skynet but believe they have plans to deploy to ipfsfilecoin too the docs walk you through attaching a handshake domain
331718,have you or anyone here tried using it just asking to see if it would be worth the time to actually test it given it seems to have a token i have never heard of with a dead price so just giving the usual scam vibes
331719,i havent didnt realise there was a token it was called argo before and was free to use
331720,yes
331721,meh in that case best to direct any qs in arweaves dev discord first
331722,usdo depeg
331723,whats the best institutional safety grade hw wallet
331724,fleek ens domain evaluate handshake and arweave
331725,fleek is great
331726,short answer no even on ipfs as the pinner youre kinda liable
331727,ship the frontend code as open source ask nicely for others to host it for you
331728,wen decentralized aws
331730,thats an oxymoron
331731,
331732,whatever happened with what was it holochain
331734,closest thing ive come across is aleph with their microvms
331735,the ppl has questions
331736,
331738,wow
331739,i was expecting something at the end of the article like karma points are now extended hahaha anyway wont be able to participate to this like vip seat sale if not for the lobsterdao fam thank you very much
331740,hi lobsters could you please help me i need 27 goerli eth to continue staking testing but the faucet is broken the website also shows the error maybe you have goerli eth you dont need please send it to 0x0c1b6f40935187dce7acd47dd986b9896ddde8f0
331741,hey guys do dapps generally use etherscans api or do they build their own tooling to parse data from nodes curious to know if i should recommend the api
331742,infura alchemyapi
331743,dapps use rpc services
331744,any dapp using an api is at high risk of breaking if the api goes down or puts out bad data for example
331748,i have been hearing about rpc a lot could you please explain whats it and how its different from api sir
331749,you query a node directly using rpc so the data is direct from chain in its most raw form
331750,follow us on twitter to keep up with the daorelated news twittercom10b57e6da0status1501619781048360966s20tn2iejqqxqklpqbzcddipnq
331758,is it too late to be eligible to earn coinlist karma points
331759,i think it is i tried and only got an error that the event is over i tried 1 month ago
331760,oh i see and how to be eligible actually
331761,pls join lobsterdao sirs this is the main techrelated chat should stay clean and informatie
331762,you can still earn coinlist karma points by performing other actions on their site eg staking trading lending participating in sales etc
331764,would you happen to have the links related to this
331772,i think he meant flashbots in which case the discord link is discordgg slash 7hvtycdnck
331773,please reference him as his excellency
331774,show respect
331777,anyone know a good team token lock up app with built in vesting
331782,are you looking for existing tokens or solidity source code for your project
331783,i was just looking into this i am not sure which are good but trustswaps teamfinance seems to be free then there is revestfinance and unicrypt
331791,ah see youve already heard of us happy to answer any questions you have in dms especially wrt custom locks kpibased vesting is an underutilized feature in defiim lead dev on revest for context
331792,does anyone experience issues with etherscan
331793,it doesnt show recent txs rn
331794,thanks what would the use case for etherscans api be then who actually uses it
331799,people doing analysis and providing non mission critical services
331800,a dapp needs live and trustworthy data directly from a node to process the relevant logic
331801,for analysis it almost seems as if dune will be a better alternative non mission critical i guess will be wallets and some info aggregation platforms like dappradar or dappcom
331802,yeah true
331803,anybody here having issues with metamask and brave i have been having problems lately with pwas not opening up tools create shortcut open as new window i can click on the icon and it pops up but it does not connect to any site all other wallets disabled in the extensions settings
331804,jump ship from metmsk ser
331805,i recommend frame
331806,when chrome or brave malfunction use firefox shit opsec but oh well
331807,unfortunately its not great on braveledger lots of signaling issues doesnt see the tx shufflling between 34 browsers is the practical way often firefox is best
331808,why firefox worse opsec than chrome ser i was under impression was other way
331809,actually just found dxsale has it but thank you
331810,nan
331811,this is the kind of feature i was looking for customizeable vesting
331812,switching between browsers is meh
331813,thats why ive been sticking to internet explorer like a true chad
331814,i use chromium for metamask only
331816,hey guys anyone know where to collateralized my uni v3 lp
331817,you can lend univ3lp on wildcredit
331818,was the last incident fixed be careful in such instances w anon projects not saying anything bad though
331819,yeah it was
331820,that was a calculation error in v2 beta its no longer in beta
331821,i have been having issues with transactions not going thru both on browser extension and mobile app
331822,as old as the world advanced reset to clear close browser fully then open try another browser make sure contract data is on after a possible ledger update try ledger live bridge instead mehif nothing helps nekk urself ur money is gone
331823,ser you forgot the oldest turn it off and on again
331824,just putting this out there
331825,everyone is just buying up these genxmillennial touchstones and trying to cash in on the name recognition
331826,you telling me radioshack defi isnt a legitimate attempt to revive an industry giant and its connection the worlds most blatant liar and charlatan isnt just coincidental
331827,limewire nft comes w 8 viruses for nostalgias sake

331834,im already in there thank you
331846,can anyone confirm if this
331847,if it is nibbio
331848,discussion about lobster dao nft and nansen possible collab moved to special dao chat tmelobsterdao35065 nothing decided yet and any activity with treasury needs a proposal and a full gov voting processthank you for understanding lets keep this chat tech focused
331849,another midweek review to stay up to date with all the bullshit
331858,hi allcan anyone guide me safe layer 2 platform to launch my nfts
331859,i know does that
331860,wasnt targeting that too
331861,filecoin plans on adding compute via filecoin vm which could be interesting compute over storage
331863,i dug into maplefinance after reading cryptocats post on how mgnrio abused maple check out what i found
331864,didnt mgnr admit to double dipping whats the point of speculating whether mgnr was clean when they basically admitted to it
331865,thats not the point and i am not speculating lmao i included all the txs and this was also reported by cryptocat what wasnt reported is that fbg capital was involved too
331866,you have a section literally titled now is mgnrio fair game
331867,did you read it i showed first that mgnrio was wrongfully accuseds on their first loan so i made it clean that they did it on their second loan
331868,thats a fine thing to say in an article whats wrong i would argue they did just fine because the platform probably wanted them to do it anyway
331869,the arg above isnt about whether mgnrs double dipping was fair from what i understand the article tries to suggest that mgnr didnt double dip to begin with and that it was wrong fully accused by cryptocat of doing so also reiterated by the author above im saying if mgnr already admitted to double dipping whys the article trying to question if they double dipped at all by trying to claim some of the txn cryptocat reported were fbgs
331870,what is double dipping
331871,thanks sir
331872,the same entity borrowing and lending on the protocol to get both sides of liq mining rewards by recycling funds
331873,i see thanks for explaining
331874,ah ye fully agree they said they did
331875,guys i have been so paranoid about this approvals on terra network can someone please share how approvals work in terra ecosystem is there something like revoke tool to check the approvals given and revoke them
331876,from what i know double dipping is acceptable because it has technical boundaries its been done by venus for example so that the team can not lose control of their platform token
331877,thats a terrible example as venus is a scam but anyway double dipping is different in cefi in defi wrapping around in compound fine it is intended for that capital is real you pay fees access is fully open etc double dipping into a kyced undercollateralized protocol gaming the system rekt
331878,hm i dont have the venus context but in general any permissionless protocol is ideally expected to be sybil resistant to ensure incentives arent exploited you dont want the same btc utxo to be used to pay two people or someone just mining all inflation by creating 1000s of fake accounts
331879,you have much better insight than me on the situation im interested to learn more
331880,i got your point but i didnt search for another source and i wasnt aware that they admitted it when i wrote it the main point however is fbg capitals activity and the fact that they still managed to get a loan a week ago although they double dipped before
331881,i think usage of double dipping wrt incentives from same entityprotocol is different than double dipping used in aggregate sense for defi or cefi economies for eg x can give a loan to y and x can use that debt instrument as collateral to lend from z so the economy of x y z here double dipped on the same capital to inflate activity essentially the reason why derivative markets are so big this is totally legit till x y z are separate entities
331882,got it but surely there is some formula to work out whats the inflation rate given the frequency and volume of double dips between economies xy and z
331883,yeah i realized that if i could give some polite suggestions on writing skills i would say you can highlight the fbg point as your claim and reiterate it more clearly in the conclusion the way it reads now seems to just exonerate mgnr
331884,ill be thankful for any suggestions its one of my first writings and i am aware that i need to learn a lot yet
331885,as for inflation well designed protocols build in sybil resistance for eg you cant just mine btc without actually spending proportionate electricity most defi protocol emissions are gamed cos real deterrance requires users to spend real to capture value outside incentives kyc is amongst the strongest form of sybil resistance the maple incident was embarassing for the team cos funds were gaming their incentives despite being kyced implying that either the team was dumb or intentionally turning a blind eye to boost marketable activity
331886,as for economies i think in the real world no one today except quants at gs morgan stanley etc have a clue about how the derivatives are all related over what capital base its too large and too complex
331890,i saw this message from coinlist that lobsterdao members got a great gift from coinlist i would like to be linked to the old conversation here in the group about this would be interesting for me
331893,already happened way back dec of last year ser the 2000 karma points is about to expire later at the end of thid month
331895,patrick i guess this would be the starting point
331899,thank you im coinlister this was really a great gift and only 18 have implemented it thanks for the link to the excerpt
331903,so i am willing to stand corrected that that the first loan was fbg and not mgnr as i had no confirmation that the fsb address was theirs you could confirm that from the 2nd loan they took out data which i did not have when i did my analysis that is not to take anything away from maples incompetence if anything it makes their allocation process even weaker as they keep distributing more funds to actors who abuse them
331905,lol nansen protected by censors
331906,there is not even a proposal listed ser your comments are not really doing anyone any good nor are they providing any further discussion
331907,keep it in that chat youre here to get this group to attack another community member
331909,polygon rekt again it seems heimdall layer just stopped working
331922,locallystored nfts ie colocating the content of nfts with the registries that track them ooh i completely missed this use casei wonder how they fit in the whole modular blockchain paradigm
331923,this is v cool and also v smart imho
331924,curious to understand pricing dynamics v centralized alternatives
331925,sure gm and happy to clarify here mgnr wasnt the second loan thedefiac is correct fbg was the other loan they had committed to 2m participation in the liquidity program prelaunch in feb fbg have a large organization and the treasury desk wasnt communicating with the borrowing desk the deposit was about 2m from their treasury vs borrowings todate of over 65m they didnt sell the tokens havent deposited more and have been a terrific borrower in all respects since hope that clarifies but happy to answer any other questions
331926,of storage or compute storage was quite a bit cheaper than s3 due to being subsidized by inflation i think
331927,y inflation in filecoin is wildly high
331928,filecoin cost amazon cost 001 the cost of amazon s3seems a bit crazy
331929,but i do wonder if that could be a semipermanent thing
331930,3b circulating mcap v 34b fully diluted
331931,since theres a burn mechanism also
331932,last i checked file coo was far cheaper than aws as the network is vastly over provisioned supply v utilization also token isnt doing too great
331933,where did u find data curious to see what data sources are out there
331934,so many crypto cos relying on aws ec2 which can also get very expensive very quickly
331935,starting to see more protocols and infrastructure providers begin to look at running their own bare metal
331936,these are my findingsfil circulating supply will only hit 2 billion units if fil is able to reach a yottabyte of cloud storage capacity in 20 years time a yottabyte is over 1000 times the current storage capacity of aws azure and google cloud combined2 billion all tokens slashed tokens not countedtheres been 29 million tokens slashed so far
331937,but during first years its quite high yeah
331938,
331940,1gib storage is currently 00000109 year fil is being insanely subsidised
331941,frens also youre seeing new color for twitter links yesterday was black
331942,yep
331945,yep but if they can do it almost indefinitely
331946,i guess it will depend on whether it keeps growing
331947,gona answer here as well if they didnt sell the tokens that makes it actually even worse because they kept earning on it in their other loans
331948,
331949,steth being wrapped around brrrr need more leverage
331950,speaking of leverage and indexes doing ghearbox hour in 20min on twitter
331951,could you link it
331952,u asking me to shill any day ser
331953,pls stop shill ser i ban you next time
331954,
331955,hmmm
331956,damn was just about to send that its a good read
331957,its clickbait binance had issues with ftm liquidity for a good while
331958,how do you prove this its possible tough to prove
331959,everything makes sense now
331960,there are enough quotes and details from official sources from the past year its up to them if they want to engage or not with it but most users that used fantom know this we even had a meme coin cztears because withdrawals were always closed when demand started
331961,why would you bridge the funds from ftm to mainnet then send the funds to another address before hitting binance while you could just do ftm to binance
331962,multichain liquidity
331963,fantom has a serious liquidity problem some protocols like tomb or beefy are trying to fix this with synths
331964,wow i am a ftm bag holder and i am scared pls andre come back
331965,lol
331966,
331967,rekt should get a statement from binance easier said than done ofc but would make the piece complete fondations should be more open on this obv
331968,most people that are in deficrypto for a while know exactly what agenda rekt is pushing they are not interested in facts
331969,definitely the mouthpiece of the curve gang
331970,i remember the amount of salt in the saddle finance piece was impressive
331971,as much as they claim to be a platform for whoever wants to talk ive never seen something positive about yearn surely at least one contributor will have something to submit to it
331972,dont get competitive attitudes in this space already people fighting over who gets how much of the pielike just get along and work together theres easily another 50x left for teams who build good things market capitalization is all but guaranteed to go up in the long run
331973,if you cant fork it or your fork is 90 and people complain write an article about it
331974,gearboxindex coop
331975,deep down we all knew it was a scam
331976,nothing could be up only taking profit is normal
331977,nan
331978,this is more interesting
331979,spookyswap has nothing to do with the fantom foundation really terrible clickbait to lump us in for no reason
331980,neither does geist rekt is tabloid trash
331981,
331982,incentives programs maybe
331983,at least
331984,every project on fantom with tvl is part of the incentives program
331985,spookyswap released way before the incentive program was announced
331986,lol actually i have no idea why he dragged in almost all the projects there but the speed zach came out to say hes wrong is also hilarious
331987,so has some relationship at least
331988,isnt fantom 4ish years old
331989,dont ruin the narrative
331990,
331991,that does not really matter you can also follow that scheme by starting out with recycling an existing project makes he whole thing cheaper as you have some exchange listings and infrastructure already in place
331992,not saying that this is a case but fantoms age doesnt really speak against or for it
331994,i dunno it rather explicitly contradicts a
331995,how
331996,fantom is not an exciting new chain avax might be though
331997,all l1 except eth are centralized
331998,he talked about the same play fork dex fork lending
331999,and the fact that the foundation is taking profit is the proof
332000,if anything swapping a few words would make that process more accurate for the project of the person that wrote the article
332001,but i digress
332002,it does not actually have to be new or exciting you can easily force that by spreading the right narrative
332003,in fantoms case that was look at our new consensus mechanism among other things
332004,i mean just look at cardano its absolutely uninteresting and always has been and they pulled off the same scheme basically
332005,that was an opinion the funny thing is that fantom is not even a chain especially not an evm chain but that is way above rekts capabilities to research into
332006,it is interesting how the word consensus brings joy and spark in the eyes of retail investors i have heard it from gymbros turned brypto shills on youtube more than once i highly doubt they have the slightest idea what is consensus why does it matter etc
332007,why not use stablecoin wbt eth then those bridge routes are unaffected
332008,the average retail investor does not even have enough technical understanding to actually recognize a superior chain if there was one they simply believe and parrot what influencers tell them
332009,4 years ago perhaps i remember the discussions in ccr when it was a whitepaper
332010,you are missing the point its not about the actual circumstance but the story being told
332011,fantom is the same category as avax cardano and solana for retailers
332012,id say that most halfdecent retail knows cardano is a scam at this point
332013,and it has promoted itself with much the same narratives and methods over this cycle
332014,granted but you get the idea
332015,the same way market makers have a ton of tokens supply and pamp it
332016,if you say so
332017,narratives are being pushed whos doing the pushing is up for debate
332018,assuming people are acting in their own interest its not hard to figure out who does the pushing the people with the biggest bags i rarely see people promoting projects on a massive scale they have no vested interest in
332019,i like the people who are building on fantom not as much of an oldboys club just yet whales will play their games but you win with people
332020,rekt should decide if it wants to do objective investigational reporting or exist in a tabloidstyle space they seem to have biases and write in a smug tone that implies an axe to grind
332021,believe the ppl or person behind rekt indeed do have a specific axe to grind
332022,then it detracts from their credibility
332023,if butthurt is a bag would rekt be a whale
332024,but what do people want more ftm is 1000x from atl
332025,arguably the person was not credible to begin with so i dont think it matters its more like entertainment
332026,they capitalized on some small provable fud to make up the other 80 of the story
332027,well the issue is look how it gets passed around as hard news
332028,rekt is basically just farming engagement and sometimes they do not write about things they could write about because they like themhave bags some things just seem to be outright personal feuds also but overall i enjoy reading their stuff
332029,typical yellow press bullshit i do not even like fantom but the yellow part is clear
332030,rekt is 10 facts 90 julien fiction
332031,do you like anything but stables lol
332034,ur mom
332035,yes he likes gear ser
332036,lol
332037,the 15 yr old argument always works
332039,taking profit is bad when youre not a community member havent you heard
332040,they are just providing the official buy and sell signals for us tho its a public good ef is all about public goods
332041,say someone has pure 100 facts supporting them and wraps it up in a sarcastic and silly way for readability and humors sake as opposed to 20 fact 80 hmmm is this acceptable say a more stylised zachxbt or is this in your opinion just more yellow press incendiary bs that clickfarms
332042,this reads complicated i cant understand
332043,is this about the shitpost to good post ratio
332044,its difficult to blend the two styles together especially when the byline is always the same ie rekt news you cant differentiate between editorializing which is allowed to include opinionsbiases and hard reporting which should stick solely to facts and data
332045,imagineim writing a new article and its perfectly supported with great evidence but written with lots of silly sarcasm etc wrapping the facts together is this overstylising or a good way to engage readers
332046,rekt doing easy and cheap journalism of clickbait and half assed assumptions i have seen great articles by them its a shame to see this sort of stuff
332047,oversylising and a quick way to dillute the readers trust around the facts youre trying to communicate
332048,as opposed to a rekt 8020 ratio my silly sarcasm is backed up a 100 fact ratio
332049,is that why stocks only go up
332050,thx ser
332051,this is how u deal with fud 101
332053,ahhhah yes i dump on you
332054,will be interested to see if theres an apology and a retraction
332056,i recently watched a video in which beyonces producer talks about corite does anyone know what that is
332057,yes i was aware of that its similar to a platform where you may invest in and gain from your artist
332058,lol
332059,apologized the an actual scammer lol
332060,amazing how rekt took the little good will they had and destroyed it for boutelarp personal vendetta
332061,it was always psyops if you read it like that then its an okay resource
332062,tldr rekt wrote some bullshit on fantom thats not really true
332063,yeah provably false from onchain records transparent hatchet job
332064,what are the best resources on tokenomicsdoes an encyclopaedia of different mechanisms exist
332069,starting to see blabla redacted
332070,rekt has a solana inclination that is also public knowledge whew
332071,but yeah zach did the antizach today and saved us from homebrewed fud
332072,have you tried turning off and back on again
332073,for all the fantom fud how many times has it had to shut down like matic and solana
332074,this shouldnt be an acceptable standard for any blockchain for me the moment a chain goes down and gets restarted once it is dead to me no longer legitimate perhaps never was
332075,it had an issue with a validstor shutting down and it had too much delegation power at that time for about 6 hours this happened before it had any user traction on chain the number of validators remains the biggest issue for fantom but that issue afaik is solved
332076,then youll never use a chain because all have had issues at one point including eth
332078,
332079,false
332080,or this
332082,might feel a little differently if its done in such a manner
332083,blabla at this point btc and eth had issues too i am not excusing other chains not a fan but semiarguments are lame onto something else this chain fighting is retarded af thanks
332084,thank you
332086,stripe cryptoarticle comments
332087,thats interesting from a sysops perspectivehow could we do more reliable upgradesmaintenances probably sharding would help curious about your thoughts high availability in blockchain is an interesting argument
332088,we have seamless pow upgrades not sure whats the problem from technical point of view to do the same with pos i think this is two different cases one is planned upgrade another is investigating performance issues that require to shutdown the network
332090,pow upgrades arent really seamless though are they if you miss a notification and fail to update your software you end up mining the wrong chain head
332091,as far as i know nothing is truly selfupdating and if it was that introduces the risk of supply chain attack with a bad update
332092,closest ive seen is maybe avalanche where you run the node script again and it pulls the latest release builds and redeploys but thats fine because theres only a single client software
332093,whereas eth has numerous clients
332094,seamless for the network i mean
332095,its still reliant on everyone coordinating software updates by an arbitrary block number though
332097,thanks i am thinking about canary production upgrades or isolate part of the network to understand the performance issueatm on ethereum at least we are promoting and deploying software all at once
332098,link plz
332102,reminds me of com programming
332103,
332104,i wouldnt say the whole network stack just the stf
332106,at least they apologized too little too late perhaps maybe a bit more of an explanation retraction is in order
332107,lmao
332109,shorted ftm and got 2 token roi despite falling 10 in last day phwoar
332110,this normally people dont do such stuff
332111,good
332112,meh second time they do a hit piece on andres teams last time was the cream hack if im not wrong now this there is only so much apologizes can do its sad i used to love rekt
332114,
332115,which suit dildo made this
332116,um do you need to kyc to get an anchor account
332117,lol what surely the intern is whipping up some sybil wallets as we speak
332118,
332120,anc depositors next week
332122,tripletdao
332125,i wish there was a way for one entity to have more than one wallet guess well never know
332126,there have been some real dummies making proposals on anchor
332128,gn lobsters as you know gitcoin gr13 has started already so if you are considering donating here are several excellent grants maintained by lobster dao members gitcoincogrants3150defiweb3developerroadmap my own grant gitcoincogrants200vypersmartcontractlanguage gitcoincogrants1809vfattoolsyieldfarmingcalculators gitcoincogrants1620thedailyapeif i have forgotten your grant please reply to my message or dm me i will add it
332129,this is amazing
332131,is there a ftm lobster dao token
332132,hey accidentally sent dai to a dai smart contract is there any way to get the funds back please help me this is a very large amount for me
332133,no we have nft collection only no plans on issuing a token as well
332134,only if there is a withdraw function on the contract should reach out to the owner
332137,seems u sent it back to the dai token contract
332138,yes i sent to the dai contract
332139,i dont think there is a way to recover sorry
332140,there was a question here earlier about a trello for daos were hanging out with deworkxyz and commapp founders in a spaces coorganized with zeugh juicebox fascinating new projects let me know in dm and ill add you as a speaker
332141,wondering why to even lower down the yield for high net worth depositors when they say our yield is fully backed i dont own any lunaust and neither shorting but it feels so frustrating to see all this coz someday its gonna fall off and take all off us several years backward coz of some chad founder and a gang of vcs desperate to save their bags
332145,is lido the best way to get steth or can i get a better deal somewhere else on secondary
332146,you can buy from the curve pool for a tiny discount
332148,polygon down bad
332149,
332150,i checked but it appears to be higher
332151,nan
332152,yup theres entire network downtime
332154,99 julien fiction some of the titles are correct but thats allthey cant research anything and most of the things that they post is based on nonverified tips and nonverified articles that the community gives to them and then they proofread
332155,curious how it would affect degenbox strategy obv any high net worth wallet can just sybil his way back to original yield however im not sure how this is going to work with degenbox
332156,possibly this is the idea behind the proposal since anchor ppl hate degenbox so much
332157,i wonder what happens to leverage positions if whole chain down
332158,nothing until the chain is running again
332159,can you give an example of pure fiction there instead of fact i really dont agree with your statement
332163,missed this will listen tonight
332164,its done through scriptsmanually anyways just segregate into 100s of wallets and automatically claim
332165,i have one question for web3 data people shill web3 and say that its owned by users but how can it be owned by users if theyre accessible to everyone without the owners permission can anyone use your owned houselets take nansen for an example if datas are really owned by users all on chain users should sue nansen for using their datas for profit data owners can also require etherscan not display their transactions if the data is owned by them
332166,i think youre conflating several thingsyour digital assets certainly arent being controlled by anyone else for example your tx history on a non private chain might be visible but no one else is spending your coins
332167,but its not controlled by me either because i cannt set the permission to it people use my data for profit while i cannt do anything
332168,now im talking data as an asset
332169,i think tx metadata data value is often out of the scope when people talk about digital asset ownershipif youre that worried abt people profiting off your txs then consider using smth like aztec
332170,i dont see a contradiction with web3 protocols offering more ownership over certain asset types while not necessarily offering full ownership
332171,yeah so the question turns to whether the onchain activity belongs to user
332172,fwiw with various zk schemes you can own this data
332173,eg revealing x only when the user initiates
332174,does it mean if people choose ethereum they already admit the transaction is accessable to everyone on the other hand if they dont want to be accessed by others they can choose not to use
332175,yeah eth like many other networks atm is merely pseudonymous
332177,whats the best way to get random number without vrf
332178,depends on the chain the timestamp problems dont rly apply if u can trust the validators on some networks
332179,lots of further qs does it need to be synchronous rng how many bits what is it forsecuring
332180,
332181,it is back isnt it
332184,i think my message got deleted from last night for some reason so ill post one better good reference for ppl wanting to know what yield farming is doing
332185,jump has a whole reading list on what to read if youre new to crypto
332187,yeah a member had asked for a resource last night shared one saw it was deleted when i woke up but agreed jump is great
332189,doesnt seem so
332193,geezanother our upgrade failed
332194,
332195,sorry if shared already
332196,why is fantom so underpriced per tvl some say fantom doesnt scale well but dont all chains scale poorly on their l1
332197,fantom seems to scale decently so far given its high usage
332198,lol their source is polygonscan
332199,polygon network is working fine for me
332200,it seems to be a myth due to it having only one rpc which gets overloaded every time there is a run i never had to wait more than a few seconds to get included after actually getting my tx through
332203,ive tried developing on it and there are times that no rpc works as a general rule of thumb i find that most evmish chains fall apart under heavy load
332204,interesting so this seems so kind of a client problem perhaps or on the lachesisnetworking side
332205,if basing on tvl to say a network undervalued eth is overvalued
332206,0 idea was never that vested to dig deeper
332207,brilliant post by norswap on the new fault proof system on optimism ser when did fraud proofs translation to fault proofs
332208,hey lobstersim trying to teach myself how to query a contract with the intention of displaying the data in a browseri have an understanding of how ethereum works but i only have super basic coding abilitythe reason im reaching out in this group is to ask if i am thinking about this the right way as i have searched for some simple example solutions but perhaps im not looking in the correct spotto begin with i am aiming to display some of my own lp pairstoken balances so i can learn how to query json i am planning on using infura web3js are these reasonable tools for querying small amounts of contract datathanks heaps
332209,hey guys any founders here from the african region been doing some research and wanted a pair of eyes from the continent is it fair to call it an ecosystem because theres like 50 countries
332210,anyone that knows a bit more about terra that would be willing to answer a few questions dm me if you do
332211,yeah thats fine
332212,
332213,thanks fault proof is a new term were trying to push to capture that theyre not only designed to catch rugs but also more commonplace bugs eg sequencer forking from canonical l2 chain as reflected on l1theres also a legal angle the idea that a succesful challenge implies we commited fraud makes the lawyer sweaty but imho the first reason is good enough already
332216,web2 companies playing kyc aml without understanding what they are doing is typical your local post office will want to check your dna and etc nothing new nothing to discuss
332220,are these trustable after grims exploit i doubt every autocompounder except beefy mb
332221,grim forked and modified code from another project which is why it was open to exploit it was the new code they added that got exploited if you look into the longstanding ones that have now been around over a year most are a fork of pickle or something similar and are audited
332223,
332224,this makes less than 0 sense
332225,it is not by the benevolence of the bread maker we eat bread
332226,he has cfa in his name we must trust him
332227,being a cfa myself i am asking myself if the cfa rules actually allow working for a ponzi scheme
332228,what the hell is this
332229,best proposal ever like a robbery
332230,decreasing a wallet from 3m juno to 50k juno
332231,can we prevent reentrancy attack with just nonreentrant modifier on openzeppelin
332233,the answer should be yes but is there any particular reason youre asking
332234,can you please link the proposal
332235,governance attacks are real yo maker invesys heavily into forta agents to detect this type of malfeasance
332236,the reasoning behind the proposal
332237,
332238,tldr a fund sybillattacked the 50k whale cap for the stakedrop and received 25m instead
332239,so they propose to remove 25m minus the 50k and add those to the community pool
332240,wowzerrs i feel like it will evolve to a dao hard fork situation where code will not and the community does what they think is in the best interestfo be protocol
332241,as code is law does hold in the face or hacks
332242,he she should never have consolidated them into 1 address though
332243,never understood the code law thing its not law its consensus
332246,this is just coping because youre poor and someone else is rich
332247,thats interesting do you have documentation of how they do so
332248,but sybilling airdrops have kinda been discussed to death already so no point in rehashing
332250,also confiscating the perps funds via governance though
332251,
332252,i stand corrected in that the original post wasnt a governance attack but a response to a potential one at any case forta agents rockthe weakness though is that once you publish the agents attacks can circument the alerts easily it might be of interest to also check out some of the stuff microsoft and a18z are working on around it
332253,could anybody check if its possible reentrancy attack function makeofferaddress tokenaddress uint256 _value public payable requiremsgvalue _valueno pay proposal storage prop offers_msgsendertokenaddress address payable offerer payable_msgsender requirepropwinner offer accepted if _value propvalue require_value maxpriceregisteredtokenaddress min offer requiremsgvalue _value propvalue else uint256 bufferedvalue propvalue propvalue 0 addressupgradeablesendvalueofferer bufferedvalue offers_msgsendertokenaddress proposal value _value winner false emit offermade_msgsender tokenaddress _value
332254,i think therere some major critical issues on fraktal contract code
332255,have you tried running these through slither
332256,hmm no
332257,ive been reporting about their coding style but fraktal owner never listen me
332258,are you reporting actual bugs or subject style errors if they latter i am 100 sure you are pissing them offf
332259,but the code is interesting they import the rentrancy guard but never use it
332260,forta is crazy cool in how endless the utilization opportunies are
332261,what is it about i missed things
332262,
332263,its a runtime security for ethereumask oppossed to recieving alerts when a condition happens forta agents scan the mempool for trigger condition and allow to to react to them
332264,anyone know why mcap tbal for wonderland
332265,elevating your security posture from reactive to been able to shut stuff down before they get hack
332266,same for olympus or not yet tldr is that 1 dollar personally onwed is not same as 1 dollar share in the same pot but with money whic cant be taken out
332267,so lost of trust
332269,nah olympus mcap asset
332272,can we check if the nft is not fake by using opensea sdk
332274,allows real time monitoring of whats happening on chain
332276,what about private mempools
332277,why do you trust beefy
332278,why not
332279,anyone thats interested in potion onboarding ends soon
332280,what does this project do
332281,options
332282,autocompounders are loaded with contract risk it was forked from yearn why not just use that instead yearn is proven to be a lot more established and safei find beefy really scummy in that they dont include fees in the front end apy calculation that they show you either all autocompounders show apys with fees included thats industry standard theyre intentionally misleading users here god forbid they actually inform their users about how impermanent loss works too theyre just sitting there harvesting fees on unknowning newbies imo
332283,blockmates did a great overview
332284,whats this unlock thing are they going dao first
332285,yes legal mumbojumbo to remove risk from the team similar in a way to gearbox i guess
332286,ser blz i wil kill u if u ask such stuff
332287,they are launching the protocoltoken distribuition via an nft distribuition the public sale of the nfts is on the 14th but you need to register
332288,keep seeing the unlock thing on twitter and nfts wasnt sure what it does anymore
332289,this makes sense
332293,hi all was wondering if someone could help me with this what are the typical testing tools and frameworks blockchain developers use
332294,check out here sir all eth security tools existingdefi dev roadmap
332295,hey fam interesting proposal by certora to bring continuous formal verification to aave if you care about aave and integrated protocols future safety you should take a look
332296,interesting that certora proposes more formal verification given that v3 was already formally verified v2 was also v3 isnt out yet correct
332297,what theyre proposing is continuous formal verification a different process
332298,correct
332299,thanks river0x i give it implicit fixed the messaging v3 is half out and the proposal is to have a continuous process in place
332300,more details here
332301,
332302,nan
332303,looks like the vote is going well yay for more formal verification its a great test and as many protocols as possible should consider getting formally verified it is very expensive but also very valuable
332304,yep its just missing 5k votes to pass and the deadline is tomorrow 1030 am utc
332305,when you are the size of aave it shouldnt even be a question problem is the same as always participation
332306,curious how this worksuser deposits funds into the dydx deposit contracthow does the offchain clob exchange get notified of said depositis it polling x_amount_of_time after user clicks deposit to see if that users account in the deposit contract has a balance in a broader scope how do blockchain stuffs communicate with non blockchain stuffs sort of the inverse oracle problem
332307,aave might consider looking at how makers delegate system has worked out it doesnt seem to have an equivalent makers delegates are very active all things considered and have roughly 10 of mkr tokens delegated to them maker has done a lot of work in this area though aave cant just pull this one out of a hat overnight
332308,events
332310,most maker votes have under 10 address participating yes the delegates are good but their system is terribly flawed for now
332311,all according to keikaku
332313,oh wow yes i didnt see that lol certainly more work to be done in governance
332314,that makes sense but can the offchain clob trust that implicitly or would that trigger a check onchain
332315,yo fellas could someone pinpoint me in the direction of a mining oriented tg group im talking about industrial scale doing some dd and want to ask some questions thanks
332316,i know its not defi but youre my most trusted group
332317,its their own contract so unless it gets exploited in a way that rewrites the events i dont think theres much to worry about
332319,yes sir i am just trying to understand how it works and then from there see hwo to achieve something comprable in soylanasoylanarust does not have eventemit
332320,never used solana so
332321,they have a weird system in that their logs dont emit events per se you have to pull an rpc to read it
332322,thanks i am seeing that in their discord so much soyyy
332323,there is an open issue for it here
332324,does solana plan on using zkrollups or nah
332325,honestly it just does not make sense for solana to have rollups
332326,why not
332327,i mean they will for marketing reasons but it just does not make sense otherwise
332328,couldnt you just have a sidechain with the same validator set and save yourself the hassle around fault proofs or zk circuits
332329,that way you arent really making more trust assumptions and the validator set is pretty small aiui
332331,where is an external call being made
332332,does anyone have insight into yesterdays polygon issues was trying to find some independent explanation of the problem solution but cant find anything so far
332333,hasnt exactly been solved yet afaict
332334,yeah that was one of my questions all i can find is news articles from yesterday and polygonscan itself shows blocks already showing up but also see a lot of recent tweets claiming its not up yetvery confused
332335,as in the pos chain is up but thats due to a hotfix
332336,the matic tendermint chain which is er responsible for checkpointing to mainnet and the staking stuff is required for the bridge to work idk is still halted
332337,got it so still serious
332338,that would basically require the validators to process double the throughput might as well just increase the block size on the original chain 2x which leads to a set of challenges
332339,difference is you can guarantee that the states are fully independent but i think solana already has some tricks around parallel access
332340,why would you want that
332341,i mean if the arguemnt is do you want l2s for solana then im saying you can probably get similar scaling as youd get from l2s with much less complexity given you have a very restricted validator set anyways
332342,wouldnt that give you the hassles of l2s having to care about bridging backforth without any of the advantages
332343,the state independence between the l1 chain and l2 is not a desirable feature composability breaks but a necessary one
332344,if you can achieve the same level of scaling by increasing the block size and the network can take it that is just a better option all around
332345,yes i think we agree
332346,or just use an l1 that doesnt need a l2
332347,is this not just a function of time eth has years of state built up other l1s dont yet but my understanding is that theyll eventually encounter similar problems
332348,isnt solanas marketing that it doesnt need it
332349,doesnt mean it wont eventually
332350,if all l1s were utilized to their full capacity and all blockspace was contended for then youd still need l2s
332351,easy just add more supercomputers kick the can down the road
332352,id say its a function of currently insufficient technology
332353,not time bsc is not even 2 and has more state and bloat and crumbles under load
332354,its actually a great case study for ethereum to be able to model growth and what the real world consequences would be of increased adoption and demand
332355,but bsc is just a clone it isnt any kind of new technology
332356,i think theres rudimentary support for bsc in erigon now itd be a very nice real world stress test of erigon
332357,polygon network back up with a temporary fix after eighthour stoppage
332358,excited
332359,we need to talk to you on zk staff
332365,hi guys maybe you know any of metric exchange devsi sent 30k usdt to contract by mistake
332366,want to recover
332367,cant find a contact to message
332368,im almost sure its impossible if you sending tokens directly to the scps there are some case like gnosis safe where its possible
332369,its depends from contract isnt it
332370,99 chance youre out that money sorry man
332371,anyone who has experience in blockchain visualization in python lmk
332372,at least in my eyes beefy have built kind of reputation surviving that bcs shit storm from last year without any mishaps but yeah past performance does not imply future outcome and every new vault comes with risk and even yearn got rekt in the past of course i am seeing yearn above beefys league but their vaults just does not suit to all my plays also if you check out their wip beta platform you get much better informed about past and actual yield fees il hopefully they got it right cannot confirm with code myself basically all that flaws you mentioned sorry does not want sound like beefys shill didnt buy their tokens i am just lazy farming hoping to not get rekti am fully aware autocompounders add smart contract risk on the other hand they reduce other vulnerabilities you dont have to login into your wallet and do associated routine as when compounding manually and expose your funds to potential malware exploits etc
332373,these kinda answers are why this place really is the best hangout in all of defi
332374,hey i do know the dev dm me please as others said though extremely unlikely
332375,is matic still upgrading their chain asking for a fren
332376,
332377,interesting overview of the economic fallout from sanctions and apparent plans for drastic policy financial and it measures it also touches briefly on how locals are using crypto
332378,from 3rd party
332379,hey guys are there dexes for erc1155 tokens or solutions not to rely solely on os
332380,not sure regarding your use case but allows direct p2p swaps of 1155
332381,thanks will look at it further the ux isnt as easy as uniswap though i was wondering if it was somewhat possible to have erc1155 tokens behave as erc20 aka interacts with amms
332382,think the rena guys did something like this back in may might check their codebase
332383,you can create adapters that comply with the erc20 interface and just forward the requests to the underlying erc1155 contract
332384,thanks
332388,i mean the function looks like its making no external callswhy would it be vulnerable to reentrancy
332390,
332391,nft stuff is for nft_avenue but this seems kind of pretty huge
332392,
332393,tether might be able to assist you thats an advantage of centralized freezable stablecoins
332394,
332395,wait isnt this becoming a bribe protocol on top of convex then so just another convex for convex feels like a complex chart for no reason
332396,its a weird orgy nice
332397,
332398,this is actually pretty good
332399,low cap shillers if in defi sometimes bring interesting ideas not saying those are just comparing old defi brains mostly just shit in each others gardens
332400,that ceazor guy he talked about makes really informative videos about new protocols
332401,ceazor will pamp all our bags blk ser
332403,no clue what these people r doing there but kek
332404,the facts are that the juno genesis stakedrop was gamed by a single entity willingly or unwillingly is not relevant to this matterbeing rich is illegal
332405,maybe it will be helpfull future seed list at coinlist
332406,lets encourage more people to hold our coin by taking away peoples coins
332407,you will be equalized
332408,imagine if there was this much complaining every time an airdrop on ethereum was sybild
332409,if youre going to enforce a whale cap and are attempting to avoid sybil you can only really take it so far imo monitoring the chain post drop to look for consolidation of accounts is pretty dumb it is what it is until there is tech in place to enforce prior to drop
332410,one unsuccessful gamerkun even got his own article commending his efforts
332411,hahaha i mean i get the issue with it in the cosmos ibc eco as the idea of many of these drops is to bootstrap decentralization of validators but its not as if cases like this are creating massive centralization the chains require a fair amount of time and distribution to occur post launch for this decentralization to occur anyway before they are decentralized large enough staked mcap many airdrops only allocate or give bonuses to those staking outside top 1025 validators which is a good incentive i dont know i get it but gg
332412,its not as if its not a known issue with pos that given enough time validators can acquire enough stake to cause some centralization but ya i think it is what it is for now until whats the solution
332413,pow also hashad this issue in a geographical sense china miners so
332414,member when we used to make fun of eos for gubernance shenanigans like these i member
332415,unstaked all my juno dont need a blockchain when immutability is a meme kek
332416,cough bsc cardano ava etc coughimo most of the larger mcap chains even low mcap chains in cosmos ibc eco dont have a centralization issue yet
332417,yeah thats more of an issue imo
332418,at least its permissionless to become a validator
332419,imagine if eos launched a year ago would have been fucking huge
332420,well vote abstain to declare our neutrality to prop 16because were in the middle of things we hope the proper correspondence of the core team we should be gentlemenweve voted abstain for prop 16 to keep the governance neutralitybasically they cant sell when the equalists come for their money right
332421,bad timing
332422,really was ahead of its time
332423,unstaking takes 28 days the proposal will go into effective way earlier
332424,wen larimer chain 5
332425,also who needs to try that hard with a 4b treasury at that time hahaha
332426,the whale is getting harpooned at the moment
332427,good point
332428,they could still vote tho and not abstain
332429,
332430,juno dev for reference while im against whale harpooning via governance when a token gets sybiled or is bought up by bots this particular event was a stakedrop with tokens distributed to atom holders with a 50k whale cap per entityperson they split 2mm atoms into 50k accounts through insider information and consolidated after receiving the airdrop they were effectively recieving 11 of the chain rewards without ever investing anything on the chain i have to clarify that apparently they also ran a japanese ponzi sheme which invested early in atom and perhaps even apparently ran tg scamsthe actor could singlehandely drain the liquidity and rekt retail investors the governance vote was not even close and the whale is screwed as the unbonding period means his tokens are locked the bad actor would still keep 50k juno 2mm usd
332431,make stupid games get stupid prizes what a weird approach they have alltogether
332432,god forbid they looked for sybil addresses before handing out the airdrop
332433,dev forbid you meant
332434,wen chainalysis to find out wolf and friends have 100k accounts and this is all a smokescreen to keep the equalists community happy
332435,very unlikely as the distribuition was to atom holders 100 agree should have been done earlier before airdrop distribuition but at the same time the actor is recieving 11 of the chain rewards without investing a single penny
332436,i cant figure out why we still pay attention to these mockchains every year there are 5 better eths that go nowhere
332437,how does that make it unlikely
332438,hello permissioned chain dev
332439,anyone any idea why so high for usdt on aave polygon
332440,now that the they gamed the airdrop cant stand its theyre a ponzi to rally the plebs
332441,they would have had to purchase the atoms it would have been much easier to just increase team allocation in the case of juno i believe its only 25 of the tokens with all tokens distribuited via stakedrop to atom holders
332442,huh didnt the bad whale here accused of splitting their tokens into 50k addresses own their tokens
332443,not 50k addresses they split 2mm atoms into addresses with a cap of 50k atoms
332444,but they owned the tokens yes
332445,therefore maximizing airdrop and circunventing whale cap 50k juno max per whaleentity
332446,proof of humanity solved this repetitive airdrop drama
332447,that means they were just dumb thats all
332448,imo the dumb part was they consolidated the 1822 mm juno into 1 address and made themselves a target for the community to harpoon
332449,if a community places such targets its a dumb one to begin with
332450,they can play communism in their own backyard
332451,ahem wen lawyers
332452,one year before any snapshot
332453,they also gamed osmosis before
332454,not nearly as much cuz quadratic still chainalalysis post provided earlier shows atoms were split starting summer 2020 8 months before stargate snapshot
332455,not saying i agree with harpooning whales but its not the devs harpooning but the community voting 80 to make the distribuition fair even to other atom whales this should have been done earlier before airdrop distribuition and it has always been an elephant in the room as the actor could drain liquidity
332456,so the team doesnt think about who would leaked the info mole 1 years before drops but blames whale who may not have done it and just got lucky for being safe for following good security etiquette split for clients funds
332457,that depends on if you assume that 80 isnt a cartel with multiple addresses
332458,we dont really need to pretend this is not a thing with gubernance especially one implementing something as obviously broken as 50kaddress
332459,harpooning whale sounds much cooler than stealing money ey d 100 teams fuckup they had quadratic multiple snaps etc that they now want to fix with second prop
332460,atom ico was in ethbtc several years ago icf still holds 1b in btc and eth so i think its very unlikely as juno was born in 2021 and the devs would have spent a fortune gamingbuying atoms only to receive a larger allocation when they could just have increased team allocation imo it was a very fair stakedrop distribution to the atom community for reference 50k atom was about 400k usd at the time of the snapshot and the airdropdistribuition was very whale friendly as the cap was 400k usdjuno had no vc investors and the distribuition was 100 via stakedrop
332461,youre making assumptions that have nothing to do with creating a cartel
332462,50kaddress is either extremely dumb or extremely convenient they dont seem dumb
332463,feigning being dumb though that works
332464,your assumption is the team owns most of the tokens when atom ico was in 2017 and juno born in 2021 distribuition was to the atom stakers dev team only got 25 of the tokens
332465,plebs voted to kill the gamerwhale cest la vie
332466,so they claim has anyone putting in effort to equalize this bad whale put in effort to find out if they really own 25
332467,its 25 until you get together and form a cartel that can never lose a vote or be voted out carry on
332469,new ideas is how things improve most chains will be trash sure but sometimes there is a good idea in the mix somewhere which ultimately will improve the space
332475,the only real question here isnt even whether this whale is a bad actor its if it were to be discovered that a bad actor has a significant stake in a chain is that a reason to modify the chain to eliminate a bad actor imo giving up the integrity of the chain is way more harmful than the potential of a bad actor having a large not a controlling stake in the chain ethereum did this after parity hack it was just as contensious but i feel for very different reasons and it does did not set up a precident like this would as was not an illegal act due to critical bug there is too much room here for malisciousness
332476,whats quite funny here is that debo the validator that is controlled by the whale as they have admitted had a description lets exit scam i noticed that a while back long before juno launched the whale said they are bad at english and they thought that meant lets get rid of scammersor something to that effectit does seem odd that a maliscious entity attempting to fly under the radar would write that knowing what it actually means and also why consolidate all accounts conscpicously on chain
332477,parity hack iirc a big bone of contention was the fact that the community refused to refund the devopsfans accidental kill stuff
332478,why the the fact i called it a hack
332479,sorry i am referring to the killing of contracts event obviously the term parity hack was just in my mind obviously an actual hack and stealing of funds was a different event which i was not referring to
332480,meant which one tbh
332481,actually it seems like i needed to brush up on my ethereum history i had in fact confused the dao hack hard fork and subsequent parity smart contract bug as part of the same event either way point still stands oh the drama
332483,i guess mutant punks and decomposed meebits airdrops soon
332484,
332485,which anon launched a new farm mid bear
332486,sick product
332487,theres been other chad stuff launched in bear expecting some actually decent stuff to get shipped over the x years of defi bera market
332488,now we know which anon
332489,i wish ser still midcurve
332491,cryptoyieldinfo twitterincredible eth transaction at 12 gwei confirming after 213 daysno wonder cryptotwitter feels quietbullishfreddieraynoldsbase gas on ethereum hit 103 gwei this evening txs from august 2021 finally getting confirmed
332493,is polyggon still bogged or is it just me
332494,network itself is live depositwithdrawals are disabled
332496,any notable crosschain apr compounders that let you deposit in 1 chain and can get apr from other chain farms did popsicle finance operate cross chain to do what what other notable onesdoes tokemak operate crosschain moving tvl as voted upon
332497,viamovercom viamover on twitter
332498,how is it live i cant even connect to rpcs from today
332499,before it wasnt producing any blocks but at least i could connect to it now nothing but they continue doing some spaces tweeting some stuff while network is down since 2 days and not a single tweet about issues they are facing so community knows whats going on
332514,redacting l1 wars convo sirs blz stap special mention to ftm why price so low but tvl sir botted all over twitter and tg its tiring
332517,its not working for me maybe am i blocked
332518,not sure what you did for the bot to block you but its fixed now
332519,no portugal in this list could anyone confirm futures available in portugal
332520,not 100 sure but yeah is available

332524,omgomg thank you sir
332525,how can i raise money for my project in crypto lets say i am building something like cloudflare workers what would be a good way of tackling that
332526,twittercomofficer_ciastatus1500492501454622723last link from tweet is ded
332527,oh awesome
332528,is it a good project
332529,you either have to have good network or great background with previous exits or you are good at selling pitches
332530,ofcourse it is thats why i am leaving my job to build it
332531,selling pitches it is
332532,if you dont know anybody but if you are a true builder you can not raise but if you know some stupid vc shits and spending value to marketing and delivering no product you can archive top 100 mcap
332533,honestly its more of a hypothetical question i just want to know if i decide to go this route what i should be prepared for
332534,be ready for1 2
332535,lots of wens
332536,mate lt really does not matter what do you build nobody care check or use your github repo peoples only interest is how to dump on retail and make 100x from a seed sale as soon as possible if you are a true charlatan to dump on retail they will be investing to you andre has a very good viewpoint
332537,im still here so dont get me wrong there is goodwonder if there ever will be a part 3
332538,then lots of ppl here cna help you find investors what not
332539,does anyone have any predictions about fees on the eth l1 in 2 years would it be more than 100 gwei or less
332540,in 2 years all your txs will probably be on l2s
332541,yeh but what would be the fees on l1
332542,btw we could all move to l2s already but adoption isnt growing
332543,yeah idk man thats a pretty open ended question depends on how much the industry sobers up and moves back to ethits l2s
332544,zksync 20 will launch this year and hopefully gets a lot of tvl but a lot of capital is still jumping across chains for yield farming and such
332545,i have a chip in this game but its a classical pattern adoption happens slowly and then all at once
332546,l2s that have launched did so midlate last year give it some time
332547,hi do you have an example of an nft which is a pdf file can you recommend what would be the best why to create such nft
332548,you can do it the same way its done for other media upload to ipfs or wherever you prefer and put the linkhash in the token itself
332549,what if we just all agreed to move to a specific l2 like make a vote between all the protocols where the tvl should go and weigh votes by tvl
332550,thanks once in opensea will the user be able to browse all the pdf pages
332551,not through opensea since afaik they dont support that in the web app but there will be a link to the pdf visible
332552,you cant some one else will always come up with a new ponzi to attract users to their l2 also that will also hinder progress you want multiple l2s so the best one can win
332553,and you kind of want multiple l2s the way i see it having multiple l2s dedicated to a specific functionality will be the way to go solving cross l2 liquidity should be solved by some other way not by mandating everyone to use one specific l2
332554,anyone playing hermes launch in metis
332555,is it an ohm fork
332556,
332557,what bridge do you use
332558,yeah the token maia is but hermes is more like solid my question is if its better to dump the rewards or accumulate to delegate the vote
332559,the official one from metis
332560,
332561,i dont think you can solve cross chain liquidity without fragmenting it
332562,i agree this is non trivial however there is some interesting work being done here starkware has an interesting proposal on this re dammmuniswap new auto router sources liquidity from mainnet and l2 albeit with alot of offchain infrastructure
332563,i hope well see an amm that also integrates other l1s like fantom
332564,someone getting away with 300k on a saturday night heist
332565,which protocol
332567,dont know seems something like paraluni never heard of them
332568,is there a list of blockchain scaling papersscientific articlesplease share if you have some
332569,paraluni some chinese scam
332570,several the most relevant wwwresearchgatenetpublication342639281_scaling_blockchains_a_comprehensive_survey wwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticleabspiis1084804521002307 dcbuildermirrorxyzqx_eljbqbm1iq45ktpsz8pwlzn1c52dmeth09bozuo0 arxivorgpdf220107920pdf arxivorgpdf211211072pdf arxivorgpdf211008673pdf arxivorgpdf210710881pdf arxivorgpdf220200561pdf
332572,heres one that steps outside the blockchain box more on the comparative angle though
332573,
332574,saw a dune dashboard for l2 adoptions are increasing
332575,thats a lot of gas oofwhat happens to minersstakers if le l2 is adopted too much
332576,staking cost of running a node is pretty low
332577,i think l1 eth will be a place for institutional trader users will move to l2 ser
332578,realistically long term everything will be l2
332579,kinda sad that so many scams are chinese and on bsc
332580,wouldnt this make eth less valuable
332581,l2s still have to complete for blockspace but since youre transacting in an l2 its much more efficient for the data stored onchain and youre splitting that l1 transaction fee with potentially thousands of other transactions im not a fullblown expert though
332582,but if the future of finance truly is decentralized and ethereum takes the cake then even with rollup technology and other goodies on the roadmap blockspace is still a premium
332583,
332584,hm ok so on the one hand because eth only settles the net amount blockspace demand would decrease but assuming l2s facilitate new use cases and expand the addressable market thats an offsetting tailwind for blockspace demand
332585,l2beatcom
332586,whats the biggest impediment now for not having univ3 lps as collateral now
332587,maybe it is collateralization ratio
332588,duality fi is literally working on this for polygon ser
332589,wait wut pls dm
332590,yeah feel ftee
332591,gud read
332592,ah ye this one
332593,is aoki active still
332595,the dj
332596,why polygon goes down
332598,isnt it having dust attack
332601,hmm it seems a bug in validator
332606,sup
332607,i am wondering if dust attack could happen in the future when the txn cost was low enough in l2
332609,sight
332612,all this talk of dust reminds me of his dark materials but i thought dust attacks were primarily targetted towards users rather than to bring down a network
332613,sounds trueso what caused solana outage weeks ago
332614,bugs
332616,it looks like a ddos
332617,there have been several outages not sure which was whenbasically one time it was due to how the communcation between validators is designed one got clogged and started forwarding all inbound messages to the others further increasing in the load in the network you can call it a ddos but its the nodes ddosing themselves this caused a 2 day outage if i recall correctlythis article says they were hit by a ddos but then goes to sayspeaking to cointelegraph austin federa head of communications at solana labs clarified that the recent outage came after a number of transactions during an ido landed in a solana block that took an excessive amount of compute powerfedera added that the compute for those kinds of transactions wasnt properly metered by the network and caused blocks to take much longer to process than the network expected he pointed out however that the network not go down at any point and can always be independently verified adding doesnt sound like a ddos but other issues
332618,thanks for clarifying looking into more
332619,it was a single nft mint on magiceden majority of solana bullishness i hear is from institutions prop desksmms is it that they are actually bullish on the tech to allow them to use some of their strats that function in a high freq low fee environment or are they just holding heavy bags or both interested to hear some educated thoughts on thisalso seems to me that what is essentially the recruiting of junior devs and shoving rust and solana down their throat isnt going to produce much quality there at least in the short term sounds like a lot of pain to me tbh
332620,it really does bring into question solanas scalability of a single dash can crash it has anyone looked at its performance when you take out its consensus messages
332621,but isnt ftm technically faster and cheaperi have yet to be convinced that solana scales better in any way and most of their reported tps are actually intranode communication which isnt goodput
332623,youre not even winning at english dude
332624,institutionally scammed
332625,would love to see another defi wave
332626,but whos yet to join
332627,thats interesting so intranode communication is counted as tps in official stats intranode communication is not on chain tho are they really reporting off chain messaging as counting toward tps anywhere i can read more on this
332628,think its on chain as its part of concensus but it doesnt add real infobut it inflates the numbers and looks much better
332629,my understanding validation is on chain and gets coined
332630,i took this screenshot during the last outage i witnessed on solana which began as a magiceden whitelisted 10k pfp sellout was just beginning funny the timing also note the far from quoted high tps capabilities prior to the event i imagine it probably got hit with max 23x that amount of txs atthe startof the mint pure speculation on numbers but still way under the so called capabilities while gas fees dont increase drastically liveness seems to be a major issue under any significant load
332631,perhaps due to the proof of history timestamping consensys mechanism from glancing over docs thats all i can come up with
332632,works just fine
332633,useful if someone wants to fund their zk wallet for the gitcoin grant directly from polygon avoiding mainnet fees didnt try personally so dyorthis is still an alpha and works only with eth check their discord for supportfin
332634,i would imagine there are a few people in here that spent 2021 on a bunch of chains bridging farming stables dumping rewards etci have used tokentax in years past but alwayys spend hours manually correcting transactions what is the best tax software i have been hearing good things about zenledger
332635,there is no good tax software from what ive seen they all have major shortcomings and require a lot of manual revisions
332636,found this quite useful
332637,
332638,interesting i think i am going to give zenledger a try the reporting method i used last year trying to remember the name wasnt lifo or fifo but i guess that needs to remain consistent does anyone know 1 wrappepd assets converting native btc to renbtc and or adding that to a stable pool with wbtc naively the irs might think of this as a trade where capital gains or losses are in play in my mind i think they are all bearer assets and no capital gains or losses should be realized 2 lp tokens once again i dont see this as a trade
332639,in germany some accountants see lps as a trade and thats so bad
332640,because the value at entry and at exit of the pool might be different
332641,lol natures mistake
332642,rotki made by a lobs i believe for taxes jpwjs
332643,github rotkirotki a portfolio tracking analytics accounting and tax reporting application that protects your privacy
332644,now we are talking thanks if i get audited i will tell the feds that lobs aint wrong you are
332645,does anyone know whos the lead on forta struggling to find online sounds like a openzeppelin spin out afaict

332653,does anyone know where i can find usage stats of flashbots protect
332654,
332655,mainnet archive node in 900gb
332656,
332657,it works
332668,if anyone has an experienceknows about a good blockchain visualization tool lmk trying to visualize ethereum address interactions
332669,check out sirtwittercomofficer_ciastatus1493395239905734667s20tmtyd5kp7x0efq5mqq9zbgtmelobsters_chat331449tmelobsters_chat313891ethtectivecom breadcrumbsapp are prob the best
332670,does this work for bsc
332671,if not can someone recommend tools for visualizing interactions on it
332672,besides bitquery
332673,try doing it with tenderlyco
332674,curious about peoples thoughts on this
332675,very cool
332676,i fear it could turn into a case of startup scope creep leading to resources spread too thinly wanna stay like my man here
332678,insanely cool theyll be able to supercharge uni
332679,i think thats a pretty cool idea where they can focus on getting more lps into spice vault
332680,hey seafood peeps wanting to farm on anchor but worried about ust
332681,worried not heres how you can borrow juicy ust with your uni v3 lps head over to
332682,and for more step by step guide
332685,define safe you concerned about the find users near you iirc tg group chats arent encrpyted neither are regular dms they need to be secret chats
332686,this is an open chatroom after all whatever you say will be dug up in four years by a caffeinated rekt writer looking for a story
332688,metadata yes
332689,research questioni remember it was some hype around alternatives to amm dexes one alternative is pmm proactive market making an idea is simple instead of simple invariant like cpmm xyc those models are using oracles price feed as a mid price with customized slippage formulai checked cpmm traction and its 99 stablecoin pools dodo dex as an examplequestion why such models dont work is there any arbitrage attacks possible for cpmm pools which are not stablecoin pairs
332690,guys this is trivial google question fin to discussion cause this is beginner privacy opsec stuff and tbh barely anyone is making big deals for millions or doing criminal stuff so dont be paranoid about buying some coins with friends
332691,fin to the telegram whatsapp
332692,i think the problem is you need oracles for obscure markets to compete with uniswap
332693,wen nodes as oracles
332695,not sure actually there are many oracles using by lending protocols which is huge sector in defiim interesting in research articles with some arbitrage models between cpmm and pmm it seems like arbitrageurs are making risk free profits if one pool pmm has certain peg and amm hasnt so somebody is paying for that arbitrage draining liquidity from pmm poolim playing with numerical models now but its kinda very time consuming so if anyone knows about research articles in that topics please shareps this is some asymmetry in industry about new hype models but its very hard to finds critical research about issuesattack vectors in such protocols
332696,are there any widely used alternative oracles other than chainlink
332697,afa ive seen its either something finagling with the earliermentioned unixswap or chainlink if youre not looking to take your chances
332698,next closest is probably band but thats not proven to be the most reliable or at least wasnt a year or so ago
332699,there are two types of chainlink usage1 official price feeds you have to trust limited number of oracles partners of link2 custom dons decentralized oracles networkstbh i see that there is no difficulties to use link oracles as open source infrastructure and projects are able to support their own price feeds and build dons by themselves with ocr 20 same validators are able to support several data feedsprojects even dont forced to use link nodes and they can just use ecaggregatorproxy interface for their own oracles so not sure this question is somehow relevant for devs at allbtw the question is about pmm amm arbitrage attacks as a reason of not having pmf for pmm at the moment
332700,lolol remember when coinmarketcap went batshit band used it as a feed and ppl got liquidated on stablecoin positionsd
332702,building your own oracle don or otherwise that is robust isnt exactly trivial or practical in many cases which brings you back to the initial problem nick mentioned
332703,but why there is no oracles issue with lending protocols then
332704,said earlier most of them use chainlink this one datachainlinkthe more adventurous ones finagle something with unixswap
332705,still disabled
332706,rarely an issue with the first but youre limited to what they support alreadythe second gives you everything xswap has but im pretty sure thats where most of the oraclebased exploits have come from
332707,works now
332708,thx
332709,for all defi researchersa great summary article about different amm models
332710,
332713,going over stuff from the past week
332714,surprising there is not a word for solidly type model isnt it
332715,i dont know much about solidly so idk
332716,i thought the thread was pretty good
332717,george wosmongton wosmongton tweeted on the future of social consensusvalidators making the final call are a better approach than popular vote on complex decisionsthey are the congress the chain itself is the product that they govern and produceto some extent this is already the gov module 13
332718,more gov things
332719,i dont follow this application of a congress to a blockchain governance system surely validators are more executive if they have the ability to have the final say congress votes on things executive tries to put them into practice admittedly with a big input of their own i dont follow this guys train of thought
332720,seems to be his response on thisits certainly interesting seeing these pos gov challeges coming to the surface in a maturing and arguably decentralized pos consensys ecosystem with ibc enabled interesting dynamics at play especially since the merge on ethereum is approaching
332721,nan
332722,is there any dex protocol where we can trade futures with expiry
332723,synfuture
332724,or use options
332725,whats a good source for checking a tokens historical mc tlv etc
332726,is there any example of simple front running bot on python somewhere
332729,very interesting would be amazing to have some scaled orderbook futures dexes likely after zks
332730,most uhft guys are optimising in assembly i dont think python would be able to scale you can check out web3py sdk of flashbots
332731,futures kinda hard to scale and asset intense verses perps
332732,you have a defined liability as platform you need to lock away assets perp relatively more efficient
332733,yes thats probably why perps have been able to scale at least to an extent vs futures
332735,true thanks ser in this case this issue wouldnt be applicable
332736,which chains have solidexly clones metis starstreamhermes what else
332738,its not there which page
332739,
332740,
332741,fork it make beautiful free spirit autonomous code run on that piece of shit blockchain like it should no admin keys
332742,thought april came early but
332743,
332744,algo vs do kwon
332745,odds are on algos side
332746,i guess its to prove a point but damn lol odds aint great at all
332747,what is algos side the bearish luna position that it will be lower in usd price 1 year from now
332748,yeah
332749,its really unfair to kwon
332750,how do you think about this ser
332751,you have the best knowledges about stable algo
332752,its very interesting i respect do for putting down a lot on luna being up 1 year from now it could end up looking like the legendary sbf sell me all sol for 3 then bet
332753,i assume this is a marketing ploy not sure how kwon will justify this 1mil after all the hype dies down
332754,sbf did that bet just before everything did a run up
332755,i dont think so algo has a bad look with luna for a long time
332756,i mean how could he not if youre the founder of a project you are not confident that you will grow a lot by next year im personally confident in fxs price being higher than what it is 1 year from now as well i dont see why its unreasonable for do to be confident luna would be up 1 year from now
332757,well luna peeps are saying that its the easiest money do kwon can ever makewho knows its either the moon or 0 imo
332758,the story with sol was back in when sol was still small luna is gigantic now
332759,algo was saying the fundamentals were shit basically they bet on future price price fundamentals luna price can be shit due to macro environment and not fundamentals
332760,luna is close to ath
332761,luna already had its crazy run
332762,maybe the bet would have been more fair if they said ust would touch x amount
332763,you could just buysell 1mln in futures without flexing and making an event from this bet
332764,true but i think as a founder do is thinking about it simply like will my project grow from what the price is right now today and it is easier to see why thats a reasonable bet from his perspective as the guy thats in charge of the project
332765,he can just hedge the bet with a short although i doubt he would miss 1mln much
332766,true
332767,this is actually a more interesting bet imo because supply growth is a different indicator altogether i wonder what the supply of all the top decentralized stablecoins will be 1 year from now dai ust frax
332768,which major chains do not have solidly clone
332769,if it is smaller than its now we are fucked
332770,haha it definitely wont be smaller but i do wonder how much larger will it be will all the decentralized ones be in the 100s of billions or will growth taper off and become more linear
332771,with current macro conditions and liquidity drying up scenario 2 is more likely in my opinion
332772,this is betting about adoptions and algo stable could be stable or not
332773,can us gov make illegal to accep block with coinjoin transactions ie if miner get coinbaseprofit from such blocks it gets guilty
332774,you can make anything illegal c
332775,also do we have defi loan liquidators here in chat would love to learn more about the best practices in this area
332777,thanks contacted them maybe i got chance to recover
332778,in hermes who gets the voting tokens and howhermes unlike solidly has a fixed 100m supply how does that work in
332779,
332780,how are the reserves being built if not by selling luna
332781,usdn was a ust since before it existed or did ust appear first
332782,minting ust and swapping those
332783,rich 80 foundation wallet prints fake stable to show growth and then find usage for it
332785,lol keep trying
332786,what do hermes starstream devs get in tokens or revenue
332787,does anyone have a contact with kucoin looks like theyre doing the usual cex thing freezing the account not responding after extra kyc provided
332788,twitter this am i feel we getting capitulation this week beware the ides of march nfa luna luna luna lunasometimes i wonder what crypto would be like if we didnt have twitter
332789,we would be back to biz and bitcoin forums i spose
332790,usdn 2019 ust 2020 iirc
332791,is solidex ui also open source why is only the solidly site coming down
332792,doing some research into prominent crypto projects with both b2b and b2c products ive got aave and olympus but struggling to think of others can anyone think of other examplesedit also coinbase obv
332793,alekmiai disclosure portco
332794,any composable defi is sort of b2b too isnt it that includes many projects
332795,thats true but im specifically looking at how they handle comms for the differing product offerings so ideally it would be projects with two or more different products for different audiences
332796,eg indexcoop powerpool disc im long cvp and had tester tokens earlier
332797,indexcoop has a deck on their site dig it up
332798,ser youre not bullish on frax price also dont rug us
332799,frax 2 eoy
332800,based
332803,feel much better now thx
332804,
332805,new round
332806,some products are definitely much more interesting for dao treasuries than for retail
332807,hatsfinance pretty new still
332808,thats rough hard to believe he didnt make any money with all his projects tho
332809,isnt it weird to escrow a bet to an individual what if he dies isnt there a defi protocol to do this with a chain link oracle or smth
332810,they could just set up a multisig yesbut i guess its more entertaining and 2m is pocket money for cobie
332811,nan
332812,its gonna be a whole day of ppl talking about luna makes you wonder
332813,but we need to wait for 1 year
332814,1 print ust 1 day before 2 pump luna3 take the payout4 use the payout to restack reserves you used to create fake supply5 win tvl up number up reserves up
332815,s
332816,gcr has not been off a lot last year
332817,would not want to bet against that guy
332818,omg someone call algod right now it was a trap all along
332819,any project benefits from the mindshare of ppl talking about it on the bird app nonstoptiresome
332820,
332824,yeah i realized its not that kind of bet
332827,what ifjust imaginethe bets are irrelevant and the hype flywheel and group polarizaton is the intention you knowlike the nft marketing strats of last year
332828,11d chess
332829,yeah is the only thing that might get luna over 100 by 1 year
332830,obviously its marketing if it wasnt it wouldnt happen publicly on twitter everything on twitter is engagement farming andor marketing at least partially
332832,just keep talking about it fam drink the entertainment koolaid cause it really really matters to your life what happens to luna a year from now i guess
332834,if you die in luna you die in real life
332837,is the bear market so bad that there are 50 messages about a fucking bet wgaf really
332838,ct drama always fun right
332840,hes a single person ser
332841,hi
332842,not on ct yawn
332844,bera market memes best memes lol
332845,why not much alpha and fun there
332846,agree
332847,not even bear market just twitter waste ground for crypto discourse these days imo
332848,he is not a vc just big anon
332849,ok fin some weird shit
332850,actually quite a lot of good information threads being posted during bear instead of moon dogcoins scams overflooding ct during bull
332851,thedefiedge for example really love that dudes threads
332852,darrenlautf daily ape posts lotst of good twitter updates from other people
332853,i now use rss on select blogs lobs as my feed no pollution here pleeeeaaase
332854,must be nice then no need to tire ppl here discussing the fun bear market twitter memes i guess
332855,
332857,hey guys going to work on a lending borrowing app any recommendations of projects which you guys think have the best tokenomics
332858,u gonna randomly work on a very difficult and very saturated app huh more context why
332859,it will be integrated inside a smart contract wallet similar to argent as an extra feature there is currently no borrowing lending on zilliqa so doesnt have to be too fancyadvanced
332860,anyone else received emails from coinbases kyc team asking for an insane amount of information for additional account verification
332861,til you can actually lose convex cvx rewards if you dont claim often enoughcvx rewards are paid out to you when you claim crv rewards in some pool and are equal to crv_rewards reduction_multiplier the reduction multiplier decreases in steps as each 01 of max supply 100 mil is mintedso suppose that you have 1000 unclaimed crv rewards and the current cvx supply is 50 mil this means that if you claim rewards you will get 1000 crv and 1000 1 05 500 cvx now suppose that youve decided not to claim and youve farmed 500 crv more but 166 mil cvx were minted by other farmers if you claim your 1500 crv you will get 1500 1 066 500 cvx the same as you would if you claimed earliertldr claim your convex rewards as often as feasible small cap farmers rekt as usual because they will either suffer from gas fees for claiming too often or from this implicit penalty for not claiming often enough
332862,isnt there an auto compounder votium or llama something like that
332863,what is finality for deposit confirmation on cex for optimism i dont know which exchange support it
332864,ive got arbitrum at 12 conf for reference
332865,
332866,i thought the pow ban was not even up for vote anymore
332867,yes im closing the acc havent used cb in a while anyway
332868,did they ask for proof of income pay slips other addresses etc etc
332869,they have been for past few weeks
332870,genuinely thought it was a very well made phish at first
332871,that is normal though any fiat provider or semilegal centralized operator is and will ask more questions nothing new accept it or leave into the crazy west of selfcustody
332872,norswap might be able to help
332873,there is this new thing
332874,i suspect it would be similiar as the fraud proof 1 week wait stuff should only apply to withdrawals
332875,kraken is less excessive than cb in that regard at least for now in case someone is looking for another fiat onoff ramp
332876,its not just cb but bitstamp aswell
332877,i dont mind giving them the information if it is a legitimate enquiry the whole thing just seemed phishy
332878,
332879,is this legit ser
332880,whats wrong with it
332881,y so much kyc
332882,i think someone shilled it in here before i have no idea if thats legit but assume you can ask in aladdindao discord
332883,is this legitprovides info it is
332884,as all of it fake kyc aml rules they just ask for the same thing 2 times so technically a person should have sent the real info by then as such by default accept all that crap is flawed but ye if they ask u have to give simple
332885,ty ser just need a trusted place for my cvxcrv
332886,np looks interesting indeed
332887,this was what i was thinking of
332888,24 in favor blew my mind
332889,ohh oki now i know
332890,the greensecologists have a strong position in the eu
332891,no
332892,heyim a core contributor at aladdin dao lmk if you have any q re concentrator
332893,i can tell acrv vault didnt make any txs yet because the tvl is low
332895,such bs
332896,just a bit of a forward question here why does a yield booster need a yield booster
332897,just read what it does and you will understand people were talking exactly about that above
332898,
332899,saves time and gas ser if you want to compound in cvxcrv
332900,thanks
332901,apologies for not seeing every message in a 18k gc
332902,i didnt mean it like that its not that far scrolling up tho hpaull good luck with that project
332903,thanks ser

332907,wants it to work with rainbow posts messages of internal chatswarning to all
332908,boomerang finance
332909,i dont know why i find their lack of tweet engagement so shocking considering they blanket banned like 95 of ct
332911,clingy ex vibes if only so much concern and conciliatory vibes were sent to people whose careers and reputations he destroyed
332912,maybe dont be a pos and suddenly no more oppression
332913,imagine being this retarded
332914,close off on dame the larper poor actor forgotten muted moving on
332915,
332916,idk why how or what but oh well
332917,
332919,w all due respect their work is not science laboratory any math masters does those charts
332920,that valuation seems way off for a startup that has raised less than 50 mil
332921,time to raise for lobsterdao at 11 billion valuation
332922,so much for the markets being borked
332923,106 ser

332926,hes learning
332927,anyone know where to buy puts and calls on eth via defi
332928,hi sers in light of recent locationbased restrictions in crypto ive compiled a thread that highlights some ways to avoidprevent such restrictions might be helpful to russians
332930,see above ser
332931,lmao
332932,aint touching that
332933,apppodsfinance currently have one call and one put available on polygon lmk if you need any help there
332934,
332935,hello hello we have an interesting curve gauge proposal for you something that touches what ivangbi mentioned in his tweet about assessing pool2 emissions and checking if it had its effect but in a very different context essentially curve gauges can be used to fund anything with arbitrary logic we wrote a few contracts that allow people to apply for crv funding subject to dao approval the first proposal is to fund vyper development a tweet on this with more details
332936,cant use bc im american
332937,hey guys just shared some thoughts on a correct hopefully apy calculation for 2token portfolios think univ3 univ2 curve etc id love to hear some thoughts from anyone whos interested in this topic
332938,gelato whale pool unlocking
332939,they do a guni spinoff
332940,arrakis
332941,proposing staking for gel holders
332942,hearing gelatos unlock is only limited by ui
332943,its actually unlocked on chain
332944,and people are claiming and dumping
332945,frontrunning ui unlock
332946,who gets the other 85 of the tokens
332947,doesnt seem fair to make a new token for the really key product a couple months after raise
332948,oh shit really
332949,can someone ping gelato team
332950,lol
332951,can you send a tx
332952,lol wtf
332953,i see
332954,supersniping by mev bots
332955,i dont think thats true at least i cant see anything unusual looking at the gel token in etherscan
332956,i found it
332957,heres
332958,
332959,contacting
332960,nan
332961,thats oka tho plus minus two hours who cares
332962,more of an issue is the fact of splitting the dao
332963,lmao they had serious issues with frontrunning during the dolphin token sale too
332964,28 of gel is circulating right now publicteam vesting tokens 472 of the supplywith a relock theyre all competing for a 15 of a new token is this right
332965,
332966,nan
332967,the conversion wrong
332968,nan
332969,i see
332970,mmm i would disagree its the second time
332971,i mean doesnt change much people that know how to automate claiming process would still be faster and sell their tokens but ig it sucks even more this way
332972,its kinda ironic in a way because thats exact problem their protocol is trying to solve but i bet most users didnt use it
332973,agree with this that split feels way too rushed
332974,this claim misunderstanding is a moot point long term if ppl here are gel holders better jump in that forum post
332975,gel peeps are legit im sure with a good discussion it will go well
332976,reasons they gave was to spin off their liquidity management solution to stay neutral with a comparison given to how coinbase likely feels about the bsc ecosystem
332977,went thru the thread i get where they are coming from theres a non zero chance a split could work long term but as it is rn im not sure
332978,this should go thru weeks months of discussions before a decision is made in any case
332979,gnosis first made products and funded internally for a while before making into tokens
332980,this feels like forcing good side of the dao be dispersed into a new coin too soon
332981,lets be honest a founder making a new coin is worse than a founder doing 10 angel investments
332982,founders making new coins for the same product is a stipulation id add onto thatnew product building on the old can necessitate a new token if the product is markedly different but same product new token is just a bit ridiculous
332983,defidave3056 gitpusha unless we r missing smth
332984,guni did find strong pmf especially since uni v3 and it could get messy growing that product line further while gelato focuses on the automation protocol infra anglebut then again gelato did find strong pmf with guni so its a double edge sword i guess
332985,lets be honest it depends on who more than anything
332986,now everyone will think they are not npc and are somehow better
332987,defi is just learning a few tricks from the nft community
332988,nah there is nothing to learn there
332989,nan
332990,setting expectations ahead of new product lines is important this product may have a token depending on how successful it is here is how original token holders will benefitthis product is thoroughly under our umbrella and will never have a tokenthis product is entirely separate from our original product and will have a totally separate raise we are no longer building for x
332991,hey this is defi and we dont know where the fuck we are headed and neither do you
332992,its easy to say in hindsight imo things grow from experiments and next thing you know ppl are talking about forming a new dao with its own token
332993,i agree but even just mentioning that you might spin off a token if project y is successful is better than just showing up out of the blue with a new tokendone right additional tokens can make a lot of sense avoid diluting the core product while building on top of it done wrong people just get confused because it wasnt communicated right
332994,nan
332995,i just dont understand the math here 50 of the gel holders team and public have to lock to get 15 of the new token that doesnt seem fair to longterm gel holders at all it seems like an attempt to stop gel from nuking when it dilutes over 7x on its upcoming unlocks which everyone is getting a taste of today and now gel holders dont even get revenue from the producti totally get the ethnical considerations but the tokenomics are frightening
332996,for now on whenever i ship a new feature ill make sure to state that said feature might or might not spin off its own token in the future s
332998,ser wen dai2

333002,hey full disclosure i dont work fulltime at gelato anymore and my opinion is my opinion alone that being said after leading growth their for almost a year i can honestly say it makes a lot of sense to spin off guni into its own project doing business development and outreach for guni was a much different flow than standard automation use cases while most use cases are tasks fulfilled by gelato bots guni is much more akin to an app being built on top of the gelato network making it into its own project gives it a lot more flexibility to grow and evolve rather than if it merely stayed as an internal project which it has been since it launched 8 months ago
333003,tfw the side project becomes not so side
333004,
333005,tbh i imagine a future where builders create gelatonative apps like arrakis we just dont know what they are yet
333006,its cool just must be an awkward position for the parent project until that future
333007,we announced kiln today the next and hopefully last new merge testnet itd be great if teams can run a full deployment on it to make sure things work as expected they should but we want to be sure that toolinginfra beyond actual contracts works as expected in a postmerge context if you want to run through the transition its expected around wednesday more info here
333008,ty darrenlautf for featuring me checking your tg channel literally daily is quite cool to see my own tweet thread featured there also keep up your great work
333009,
333010,this is not too bad actually
333011,i agree i think thats the main reason they had one of the initial usecase growth so strong but at the same time a more generic protocol i would say it demonstrates that gelato itself has good potential what could have done the gelato team instead of a spinoff
333012,very little afaics at least not without gimping the spinoff in favor of gelato people are going to complain either way
333013,hm built by the team who is funded from vcs money and token holders money but spinoff into a new product with a new token im the only one who sees this as a conflict of interest if not straightforward fraud
333014,why do you see conflict of interest andor straightforward fraud iiuc spice future token is not yet defined
333015,how is that fraud it is literally trying to isolate a different project from a parent company that does something very different so that it can grow into its own project while the team is at least trying to align incentives among the old and new token holders
333016,i understood gel holders will receive a large part of the spice supply
333017,15
333018,the spice supply hehe
333019,i think in general the counter argument is that gelato can be more than just the offering it originally came to the market with especially now that it has a governance token the decision needs to go through the community in theory
333020,i think its actually the beauty of web3 and tokens in general that you can form smaller isolated communities around specific projects where the governance is only concerned with that particular issue rather than mixing too many concerns
333021,you raised money to build product x you have a team that is paid to build product x instead of building product x you ended up with a completely new product y with a new tokenbuilt using money that you raised to built product x hows it not fraud
333022,people that you raised for get tokens in product x
333023,from my understanding this is what should happen attached newsletter sent out this evening
333024,as a gel holder you will have both tokens if i understood correctly
333025,isnt that the best of both worlds
333026,depends of course on how many tokens you get from the new project
333027,well magdalena you get a part of it 15
333028,i am not considering those number final
333029,the current supply of gel is 13889847 the september i dont know the exact date unlock will increase the circulating supply to 87293175 thats a 63x dilution from where it is now millions have unlocked today
333030,as adrianleb said and ivangbi too the best place to discuss is the community forum
333031,you have to lock token for a year to get this mere 15 vested for 4 years lol
333032,then the question is will these 15 of spice tokens be worth more if spice gets to be its own project vs if spice will remain inside gelato correct
333033,we can ask everything here
333034,which i agree is hard to define definitely is a risky move
333035,but i can see it work out i am a big fan of hyper focused teams and narratives
333036,mere crypto has gone to your head
333037,also what would the incentive be for the gelato developers to actually just spin off the project if they dont believe it would make it better the proposal says that they will get vested 24 years so they can hardly exit scam spice
333038,it is not vested for 4 years only for the team for liquid gel holders who lock they get it instantly upfront
333040,rai and mai
333042,is it possible to filter transaction by method with etherscan
333043,i dont think so but you should use dune analytics for that
333044,
333045,how does the new degenscore work do the groups close after some time or they just close the entrance to em
333047,any thoughts on the implications of curve dao funding vyperlang via emissions
333048,any other examples of a defi dao funding public goods
333049,the funding hasnt begun yet since it needs an onchain dao vote
333050,but to my knowledge this is the first attempt
333051,at current market rates curve dao would fund vyper a maximum of usd 4 million if crv goes up that goes up too of course heh
333052,but the funding cap doesnt mean they get it in a lump sum it has to be voted on like any other gauge so this has the potential to spring up decentralised funding oversight committees and in general introduce a paradigm shift in how daos are structured
333053,check bloxyinfo
333054,thanks ziggydakid and siimmoonn yeah therere other platforms to achieve it ask the question in case for missing the function provided by etherscan
333058,depending on what you want you can also download the csv and use an external tool to filter my preferred way is python and pandas for a quick and dirty analysis
333059,missing function means no abi of the function selector you can check 4bytedirectory but unlikely they have it if its not on etherscan or bloxy
333060,anyone who knows how is liquidity pool size calculated on terra market swap
333061,just saw it again this looks pretty ass tbh money extraction if anything because the pie chart of who gets what essentially dilutes gel holders of any stage a looot
333062,if you already have the users money what else you want them to have ownership for anyways
333063,
333065,try to read here tldrtheres virtual pool with basesize parameter defined by governance if its started to drain by market arbs then spread fee is going to the moon
333066,such a movie
333067,
333068,sad
333069,does anyone know a bridge site where you could pay the blockchain fees for the transfer in the asset you plan to bridge such as erc20 matic for instance the swap in question is matic on eth to matic on polygon
333070,is that a bug which is common to other daos
333071,nope read the thread
333072,damn what a story i have heard this summarized in 1 or 2 sentences only but the whole story directly from the chats is fascinating honestly changes my thoughts about ulbright
333073,was silk road the only one that wasnt meant to exit scam
333074,every single other illegal marketplace was launched with the goal of scamming
333075,1
333076,well if you actually read the thread you would realize he went above and beyond to guarantee a high quality of service for his clients
333077,
333078,bueno update tldr for those who want recaps disclaimer got a smol bag
333079,if you know the team desvs can you request adding a tiny button to add arbitrum rpc in a single click better ux
333080,sers anyone got an overview of non defi non nft ethereum protocols i mean stuff like ideamarket akashaethereumworld the non financial type protocols vitalik was talking about a while back
333081,although ideamarket is quite financial driven
333082,if you are asking about non financial protocolsfor ethereum it has 0 sense atm because of fees users are paying for each txbtw there are governance tools on top of eth cryptography but working off chain like snapshot
333083,anyone know where to check percentage of litecoin txs used with mimblewimble
333085,number of developers working on the audit
333086,im making this shit up but possibly whether its a fork of already tested code ie how original it is what the existing code test coverage is like and how much money you have to try and extract
333087,also there are different pricing for public reports with announcersbadges on cmc and just pdf on the githubi noticed that audits are more about marketing now even crowdsourced bug bounties i personally trust morealso even solidity code is updates via sc migrations so any dapp update makes audit worthless
333088,right l2 protocols included curious about other types of protocols that benefit because of immutability transparency stuff around free press censorship resistance etc but also more social type stuff based on game theory reputation dynamics etc
333089,imo its 90 reputation of the firm some auditors managed to get a reputation of rather no audit than one from those guysim personally shilling the good sers from chainsecurity as i know them personally but theres others as well id say a good rule of thumb is to check what major non bsc projects used that auditor in the past 6 months
333092,bsc is not known for many reputable projects
333093,mmm kinda but as a developer i see complexity as different to whether something has already been battletested and in terms of smartcontracts audited
333094,
333095,is this notyearn vault

333100,hey there is there any belgian lawyer here by any chance
333101,check dm ser
333102,lobster any dubai residents or those who havestore funds over there what bank is the most crypto friendly bank to cash out to fiat i have a non crypto relatedlinked acct with hsbc but figure hsbc might ask for all tx history and tax me to oblivion so im cashing out in latin america via otc selling at a 25 rate what is the easiest waybank to go crypto fiat in the country with minimal tax implications
333103,why would your bank tax you to oblivion
333104,tbh have no clue about dubaicrypto regulations just need an entity to accept btcethstables and let me cash out simply like in latam
333105,how you cash out doesnt impact your tax obligations you either owe tax or you dont and you dont owe your bank nor does your bank tax you its a bank anyway it is easy to go crypto cash banks idk but if you are trying to evade taxes which it sounds like probably better to do it with cash than a bank acct and not do it if you need to ask in telegram how
333106,yeah i mostly do otc in latam as explained and they are mostly small amounts but looking to purchase a property so i need to wire the downpayment from a bank i claim residency in a latam country that currently has no regulations reg crypto but would rather cash out in a country where i will not be asked a gazillion qs pay minimal taxes ie cash out wire to my bank acct herei have a dubai hsbc acctand my sister resides there atm
333107,the property is in uae you probably need to check the aml etc requirements where the property is being purchased if it isnt uae it sounds like adding an unnecessary step if you have coming from an exchange or coming from a dubai account the local bank will probably ask questions regardless dubai just means potentially 2 banks asking you not familiar with latam but if the money hasnt been in the bank for a few months then some places require someone to sign off on the source of funds if you need a signoff for purchase then you can also just give that to your bank and should be finebut idk though
333109,nan
333110,you are mostly right tho gussulliman
333118,have you tried research cyprus latam is tricky because regulators just fade cryptos so they dont care that much just yet that brings the good and the bad about dont giving af the good is you have plenty space to move around the bad is when you want to move what contextually in latam is a good chunk of money say usd 10k ppl starts pressing hard to know where you got that shit frombut also most real state here its not fully on the books and 100 legal so many places take cash as payment and you dont necessary have to go full wire transfer
333119,agave aave fork and hundred compound fork on gnosis chain just flash loan collateral exploited for all remaining tokens in protocols minutes aparteveryone you can think of related to these protocols is currently trying to figure out what went wrong here agave is a nearidentical fork of aave and hundred is only slightly less identical to compound
333120,anisopteran know the total value of the exploits limited to gnosis
333121,about 34m for each protocol it looks like not sure so far limited to gnosis
333122,gelato community call relating to the arrakis proposal is now live join in
333123,i think this may be one of the exploiting addresses 21174 eth balance
333124,either an issue with the wxdai contract or the chainlink oracle for xdai
333125,you think chainlink oracles appeared to be fine in the tx
333126,if you go through all the calls to oracles they appear to be sensible values
333127,illiquid assets listed in the protocol oracle manipulation
333128,chainlink oracles used in both protocols and while hundred has some pretty illiquid tokens agave was very conservative
333129,like i def suspected oracle issue at first too but
333130,which hundred is this
333131,how could i add liquidity correctly to uni v2heres the situation ive 1000 dai token and wanna add liquidity to ethusdc pair on uni v2theoretically i could convert 500dai to eth and another 500dai to usdcbut in general reserve ratio is not 11 on uniswap poolsso id like to know the correct way if possible pls share the solidity code
333132,vfats hundredfinance
333133,hey guys shared more of my thoughts about the recent arrakis proposal in this thread
333134,check out wealthy expat on youtube he talks a bunch about cashing out in dubai i believe he recommends coinfera have you found any good crypto meetups in dubai i have been here awhile and havent seen much besides a metaverse event that seemed a bit corporate even just a regular expat meetup group would be fun
333135,same community is organizing defi dubai every friday
333137,nice thanks for sharing
333138,there are no crypto friendly banks per se in dubai most banks work just fine if youre a resident and use a relatively reputed service like bitoasis for deposits and withdrawals and have proof of funds abu dhabhi commercial bank is not half bad and relatively better than dubai islamic bank or emirates nbd none of them to my knowledge recognize crypto txs or withdrawals but dont generally act up if youre withdrawing through decent exchanges and have some proof of funds your problem will be the transactions out of dubai into whatever other country wouldnt make a lot of sense if youre not living in dubai gussulliman is on point so idk
333139,yeah coinsfera is pretty good but thats if youre looking for fiat or you want to buy real estate they could hook you up
333140,sers this is not a dubai expat group
333141,you right
333142,good advice tho keep it
333143,but ye is enough
333145,
333146,according to the document yuga made a cool 127 million in net revenue last year a figure it projects will reach 455 million in 2022 chiefly through proceeds from the virtual land sales
333148,so fyi i crunched the numbers on the gelspice thingy the recent dilution was 15xthe sep 2022 diuation will be 5x assuming no one locks gelthe sep 2023 dilution will be enormous if tokens lock for spicethe long term dilution is 5x the 5x in september 2022 25x the current valuationspice dilution is a little over 3x assuming all public private and team members lockthe gelato community holds 25 of the tokens this will be around 75 of spice it will likely be far worse for small holders as whales will farm more of the liq mining spice supply whyjpeg
333149,is this gelato chat
333150,its an onpoint convo where most seem to be criticizing the move so not shilling
333151,with regards to the sep 2023 point from what i got from the twitter space is that the time to lock will be over 3 months so i assume the unlock wont occur on one day the dilution will be equal to the number of tokens locked so im not really sure that could be called a dilution
333152,afaik those that want to lock for spice arent forced to lock all their gel so you could go half and half and sell before the investor unlock in 6 months time
333153,abearrug
333154,care to share the maths
333156,
333157,4 gel is circulating now public private 21 gelteam 25 gelthese people 50 gel are who get the stab at the 15 spice meaning public private get 75 spice and gelato team gets 75 spiceif the plan goes forward the gel unlocks in 2022 will be lessened but theyll be even bigger in 2023spice community members do get first dibs on liq mining but whales get the most
333158,thats the skinny version
333159,anyways not trying to debate it thats for the proposal it was just confusing when it first came out just offering the layman terms to gel holders
333160,i think youre reading it wrong to my understandign gel team private sale investors are still locked and start to unlock in 6 monthsthe token holders who can get at the 15 spice are people with unlocked tokens now ie the 4 that bought in the community token sale whales dolphins community devs rewardees if any funds have been used here
333161,nan
333162,nan
333163,appreciate the response and im definitely not on the fence to correct you rather just wanna get a different perspectivea couple of things if everyone locks up their gel for airdrop now it pushes the sept 2022 cliff forward then we can expect a 5x dilution somewhere in the first half of 2023 sept 2023 is another unlock for investors and team though the team token will already have started linear vesting after the first unlockfor the spice part im not doing my own homework on the numbers yet though i do concur with you that whales are more in advantage similar in almost all other cases tbh
333164,the semantics there indeed can be misinterpreted
333165,this is utilizing uniswap v3 to create a buy wall that essentially prevents the token price from dumping how risky is this sounds too good to be true this is some next level token price editing
333166,neverdumpswap
333167,ah in that case since locked allocation can extend the vest in order to take part and there is more locked allocation than unlocked it seems like the public could easily get less than 75 also depends on whether locked investors can do a partial spicelock
333168,current exploit circulating regarding vecrv token forks with infinite approvals recommend any users who have any vecrv style tokens to revoke infinite approvals currently aware of a few fantom coins inspirit xlqdr vecredit are affected
333169,no risk of loss of funds but strongly advise anyone with these tokies to revoke infinite approvals
333170,lets please move away from gel stuff now probably enough has been said and discussed those interested can continue on their forum community id you care redacting future stuff
333171,any more details to this only find projects saying revoke approvals and no funds at risk but nothing else
333172,the builders are allowing people to revoke without giving details so malicious actors dont go and fuck with peoples tokens
333173,sup lobsters not sure if this is allowed feel free to delete if not ivan but wanted to share a demo of the project ive been building w grug and big d
333174,disclosures will probably be made shortly probably but idk im just spreading the word
333176,can confirm yes
333177,ser best for nft_avenue btw
333178,totally okay to share there
333179,so this bug impacts crv and all derived contracts with reliance on msgsender throughout sounds like this isnt going to be a solution a wrapper can fix just gonna have to go through approval deposit workflow for all subsequent deposits
333180,seems that way and from what ive been told thats the fix crv has also implemented some months ago
333183,lets not cause weird panic unless you have code examples or actual attack reports if they already happened you can show that sorry if i missed something but i dont see any proof for these or was there
333184,anyone aware of the new cream hack did their cloudflare get compromised
333185,ah i see spirit posted it too now joe_c1 nvm me please proceed just wanted to confirm robanon
333186,reposted wpermission from ivanif anyone from impacted protocols is interested revest just finished deploying our fnft smartwallet based solution in partnership with lqdr on fantom since it utlizes smartwallets that act as proxies for token passthrough this situation where curve infiniteapprovals can lead to uintended sideeffects doesnt impact people utilizing our system and thus infinite approvals can continue also makes vecrv positions liquid in fnfts allowing the costbasis of a position to be increased throughout the lockup deployment and integration can be done in under a week feel free to dm if interested
333187,can u guys instruct users what to do if there is something to do
333188,nan
333189,relevant
333190,wrt current issues revoke approvals to the curve contract and any forks youve given approvals to funds are safu
333191,the vecrv contract specifically
333192,for vehnd you can revoke on our vote page gnosis and optimism are not affected
333193,whats different there specifically
333194,approvals to the curve contract wdym which one i dont assume you mean all contracts of course blz specific
333195,we fixed that bug for those deployments of vehnd
333196,approvals to vecrv only
333198,any contract modeled after votingescrowvy
333199,anyone know if zachxbt is the real one submitted a full report of a multi million nft scam he said hed look into it and blocked me lol
333201,no hes said he doesnt have a telegram account
333202,okay thx
333203,afaik this is not his telegram account
333204,but do submit it here
333205,spread the tea sis
333206,hi zach my name is sashathere was a scam last year with fantompunks fork where the creator just disappeared with 1m ftm worth over 3m at some point and didnt deliver anything that was promised it was not even an erc721 in the end and couldnt be sold until the community remade the whole thing and airdropped new tokens to holdersi just checked ftmscan etherscan and the wallets are easily tracked to the public wallets of the owner they are financed via binance etcdo you think its possible to publicly expose this story track them down and bring to justice
333207,contract creator proxy address last tx final ftm address same etherereum address funded by binance it has 350k in stables also swapped some stables for 150 eth sent them to this address and then to krakenthe proxy address also has some activity on ethereumnamely it was funded from ringalls86eth which itself was funded from coinbaseit also has a public active opensea page w socials
333208,also twitter and instagram

333210,the chain doesnt lie
333211,mm yea that person seems to be a mod of a couple legit communities down bad if true kudos for the detailed report
333212,the milady pfp makes it edgier for some reason
333213,loool hope this leads somewhere
333214,i bought 9 so not too bad but hey a literal scam without even trying to hide any trails id be interested to hear his explanation
333215,me too this is great work
333216,maybe theotherpomp knows smth idk
333217,inb4 why buy fake punks this was before they were on each and every chain and a solpunk was just sold for 250k or something so it was still meta of sorts
333218,fantom foundation shilled it
333219,every foundation shills a bunch of garbage usually cause they need to show their chains have activity imho not a sign of affiliation per se
333220,cool tool built by a radix community member to try help compare the various l1s scalability security etcas the goal isnt to promote but rather educate and help collect all the information into one place he doesnt mention radixtheres a slider at the top to set the tvl theres some assumption there of a correlation between tvl and tps requirements just a visualization decision to present via tvl maybe more people understand that better
333221,idk ser this is an attempt at an ico rating maybe good intentions but 0 point in such a thing
333222,as everyone said before l1s are all moderately different remove geth forks so comparing on the metrics where one benefits the other is just larp
333223,cosmos something something shardsolana decentralized more than 500 nodes
333224,ye downvote the typical old context being abused sowwy
333225,this is a question that constantly comes up what are the capabilities of each network and how they comparei agree that precise scores are subjective but given the info you can compare networkswhich network scales better is objective features such as composability latency security are objectivejust as nakamoto coefficients actually not in the comparisonanyway dropping this
333226,
333227,who is behind lyra hearing every second team liking them surprised
333228,imagine having options on chain and get liquidated because the chain stops working
333229,wait dont imagine just do borrowinglendingoptions on sol and get burned
333235,who exactly are you saying would be liquidated and under what conditions
333236,decay or whatever is called for options
333237,that would imply that the chain goes down for an extended period of time daysweeksmonths whereby the option closes oom also that wouldnt be a liquidation its just an option closing oom technically if this did occur one could quite easily hedge their position with perps or another options exchange
333238,i would say the biggest risk would be to lps in case of chain being down delta hedging engine would be off for this to be impactful it would need to coincide with an extreme market price swing as well impact would depend on the open option contracts according to lyra docs without delta hedging most likely the lps would be extremely net short so to hurt lps this would likely need to coincide with a massive up move in underlyingif these events lined up and lps incurred any significant loss there is also the security pool on l1 that has a considerable amount of usdc and lyra which would be used to compensate lps
333239,also i think any chain going down for an extended period of time would have larger consequences than any one options platform

333279,1 promise to make nft marketplace shits fucked lets make premia2 make premia3 stake incentive mek baghodler4 do it with looksrare 5 6 champaign on a yacht in an undisclosed location is the only proof they ever existed
333280,i missed the 35 where is info and details
333281,1didnt know this
333282,hi frens im not sure if this is the right chat group for this but we are pushing our product onto the testnet and facing some technical issues is there a solidity dev here who could help me out is there any other chat group for solidity devs where i can ask for help
333283,there is scaffold eth by ausitn otherwise not sure devs could throw a few more groups blz
333284,anyone knows what the tool is for the transaction trace
333285,check the comments i think i saw it
333286,got it its tenderly
333287,just go to superteamdao for solana
333288,why i dont see we talk about gcr 13 any interesting project there
333289,what am i missing out on avalanche chain tvl doubled over 24h driven by traderjoe ripping 700
333290,yeah what the heck looks buggy
333291,so i just checked out dopex can you even buy sell btc options from what i can tell their platform only lets you buy puts on btc and you cannot write options at all their ui is literally death too
333292,did someone pull a delta
333293,
333294,my feeling is that tetra is pushing it here expected more of him
333295,oh wait it doesnt even allow you to buy btc puts
333296,it could ser
333298,i wanted to compare their options pricing to lyra as i have been comparing lyra to deribit pricing a bit
333299,1 best experience i had trading options on chain
333300,now need an ob based one
333301,thats adding to a liquidity pool not buying options
333302,responding to screenshot that was delet
333303,i fairly recently bought some options on lyra as the pricing was comparible to deribit prices also exercised some seamless experience tbh
333304,yeah for me the same limited possibilities only downside i encoutered very smooth on optimisim and clean ui
333307,nan
333308,you mean limited strikes ya thats the only thing i could fault on it i assume has to do with pool size i guess as liquidity grows there would be more far ootm options available
333309,buy put options or im wrong
333310,thats providing liquidity for buying puts yes i know fucking terrible ui
333311,yeah stikes just close to atm
333312,its structured products oriented more adequate for farmers rather than traders
333313,thats fine but whys tetra making out like theyre a lyra competitor theyre not even in the same sport never mind league
333314,lyra is an options amm pure and simple
333315,yes first time using dpx i was fked up
333316,go figure out guess usual twitter noise
333317,ye i love this approach tbh make simple protocols concentrated around a specific product and focus doing this the best way possibile instead of starting with x and adding yz which are completely out of the original scope
333318,i forgot sorry was opyn options amm too if so many stopped building on it
333319,well yeah uni vs sushi approach right
333320,no not amm you could write options and list them for others to buy kinda like a really low liq inefficient order book
333321,but it was framing itself as insurance
333322,opyn is ob based if i remember correctly
333323,got it thank you so a diff clob approach
333324,also pods is amm too i blv
333325,not really iirc it was more like a p2p approach
333326,if i can explain it like that
333327,like ebay but for options
333328,idk maybe lasseclausen wanna do it justice and explain in more detail
333330,idk if we have opyn people here
333333,so opyn was more like writing and underwriting insurance contracts
333334,each contract had a price and size and you could buy an entire contract or write one with custom strike size and pricea bespoke options contract market rather than amm or clob and it did not use a pricing model like bs the contract writer set the price
333335,psyoptions are doing well in the options scene i think they are ob based and recentlly announced that theyll provide liq and marketmaking as well too bad solana is unusable for me would like to see a similar approach on an l2
333336,has anyone with a bigger brain than mine actually had the time to go through this massive proposal i know the gist of it from all earlier info on v3 but how does this look from an outsiders perspective ie not bancor discord opinion
333337,also tradingwise im really curious about kwenta finally launching some products this week
333338,interested in the usability and effiency of it under a trader pov
333340,will you share results here l
333342,
333349,slight tangent is an onchain orderbook even feasible on ethereumany evm chainfarm42 got any papers
333350,ser
333351,actually im mistaken it doenst look like the order book was onchain
333352,orderbook was offchain though
333353,thats how the sec got their hook in
333354,depends on what your criteria for feasible are it can be implemented but naturally does not scale as well as offchain orderbooksmatching like everything else onchain
333355,is one implementation
333357,
333358,played w the testnet was clean
333359,its nigh unlikely to be anywhere remotely close to what you get with binance for example but some order of improvement over etherdelta would be a start
333360,stumbled on which mentions oasis in passing whatever happened to oasis i only vaguely remember a maker announcement about shutting it down
333362,if anyone knows best way to getbuy bulk rinkeby eths
333363,does anyone know what the innovation is there defining interfaces hardly seems like it
333364,its the fork of all forks
333365,just wait till cap join the battle
333366,balancer univ3 curve
333367,found new punching bag in gns
333368,yeah something like a aggregator that article gave me a headache
333369,sirs i am trying to build my resumecurriculum for a non dev crypto position any tips or pieces for inspiration of anyone that went through the same i ctrlf and i found which has some checks but its not exactly what i look for
333371,degenscore medium articles explaining semicomplex topics in a clear way a good twitter account with frequent updates
333372,what kind of job with some exceptions id say just find something you like want to work for and start getting involved will probably bring a job faster than cv route
333373,read route 2fi or defi hedge useful tweets darren lau jason choi too
333374,its some kind of researcher conducting daily exploration of the crypto asset market searching for news and informing the team about them i curate a telegram channel with crypto news that wont link as it would sound as shilling but that should be more than enough as qualifications problem is they want my cv and my cv has nothing to do with crypto
333375,so i need to remake the thing and i dont know where to start long experience on buying rugs and having luck with others can be a bullet point maybe
333376,best way is being a intern write some threads on tweet summary podcast your social media trust is a plus too
333377,i believe you could just update your cv with relevant crypto work and go with ityour experience prior to crypto should definetely matter as well dont diminish it
333378,might do that thank you all for the replies
333379,honestly this isnt a bad thing to include in my interview i spoke about how i learned where yield came from myself in 300 apy farms it shows familiarity were so early a friend working in a web3 company says the interview boils down to do you know what a smart contract is and if they get that then theyre basically in
333380,
333381,sadly my english is shit and i dont have normie socials because i prefer shitposting but well we will see how the things go down the road
333382,just read and learn ser this is only a 10 years old market we could do anything from now
333383,nan
333384,trust me bro
333385,just learn
333386,you are likely to find project targeting market in your native language ser if you do have the will to engage in 30 you will find a space to contribute and evolve
333387,crypto is in english and defi is in english i wont even bother doing non english crypto plus im sure it would boil down to translations work
333389,what are in your opinions currently the best alternative mechanisms to liquidity minining to me lm seems a stupid idea if there is no incentive in place to keep the liquidity miners after the duration has ended are there any good alternatives
333390,for defi i would agree main language is english for crypto i would strongly disagree as you have a bunch of projects that are targeting masses with onboarding approach in their products and the supportingeducating materials going with but yes if you consider your native language the main skill that you can apport at this day it limits you to wrtingtranslating however just an example the curation of a medium is one of the many great way to learn and onboard in a project without advanced devtech knowledge requirements but again best trick is read and learn then you gain knowledge you will want to practice and find a place because of this urge you ll find it anyway then may be at some point with enough confidence and experience you may want to go deeper and getting involved in a project
333391,would really like to read a thread on how they went to 100k followers in 2 months
333392,thats quite a wide reach if its all organic
333393,this dude seems like a grade a larper
333394,nan
333395,3 months and already acting like hes a sage
333396,tokemak curve bribes that new protocol someone posted yesterday which adds liquidity depth on the buy side only forget the name
333397,here are 3 tools which will help you to become a truly skilled copywriter quillbotcom deeplcom grammarlycom
333398,and dont be afraid to get a little funky with your writing if i may shill my proudest tweet thread explaining a report we did so long as it relates to what youre writing and its a fair verdict then its ok others are always watching dont get too lost in stylising though and make sure whatever youre saying is backed up by hard evidence
333399,gm
333400,whats best framework for live debugging evm
333401,is it even possible somehow
333402,gm use tenderlyco
333403,i like a lot they have a lot of stuff for debugging things pretty fast
333404,defintely a good tool but has bugs sometimes
333405,thank you
333406,tokemak is an option for a few select protocols their governance community decides where to direct the liquidity
333407,what type of protocols would be best suited to me it seems to be newer rank 300 protocols a brand new protocol on tokemak might cause too much il and drain eth from the protocol of the general view that protocols involved with algo stables are most suited for curve wars
333408,yes for now there are only 10 tokemak reactors and there will be a vote next month to add 5 more that any protocol can apply for but the plan over the next few months is to have permissionless reactors similar to curve factory pools
333409,bancor allows singlesided lping with il protection no need to sell tokens or do bribes or lm earn in the asset you stake
333410,theres a good article somewhere on medium by the tokemak team which basically says curve is important for stablecoin projects to maintain the peg and tokemak is important because they can use tokemak to increase use cases for their stable by adding trading pairs across defi for their stable
333411,but adding a trading pair alone does no help to a project and will only cost more emissions from a protocol pov its best if it ties in w the underlying business model dont get me wrong i have tokemak bags and havent sold since degensis and i love the team
333412,anyone interested in participating in a hackathon could submit an issue here
333413,i love the project too not thrilled about the 15 increase in emissionsinflations they announced yesterday though but im just trying to understand what you mean by this adding lots of trading pairs and liquidity with them is clearly a huge benefit for new stablecoin projects i agree lots of new trading pairs are not particularly useful for nonstablecoin projects though they are better off one with one dex pair with deep liquidity
333414,or dm me
333415,nan
333416,coreless team hard to update the market doesnt move
333417,tetra ultra triggered
333418,bullish
333419,i will look into that much appreciated i saw that olympus pro offers another alternative to lm through bonding discounted protocol tokens in exchange for lp tokens that way the protocol owns the liquidity and is not that much dependent on liquidity miners has anyone had experience with olympus pro
333420,anyone familiar with how events in dydxs offchain clob like liquidations are handled with the onchain account balances like say someone was liquidated in the offchain clob would their account balance in the deposit contract onchain be debited by a transaction adjusting their balance deltas to reflect the liquidationif this is the case what is preventing that user from doing a fast withdraw before the stark is settled on l1
333422,ok just watch the wallet
333423,sorry didnt get ur message thought was spam blz just rewrite it
333424,your defi dev roadmap looks really solid a nice balance of chooseyourownadventure and guidance to key papers perfect timing for me tbh tydo you know of any discussion groups or forums that go through the content do you see it developing in any interesting directions beyond the repo
333425,very curious about the same gas prices seem to have increased quite a bit too
333426,not an expert but im building something similar if i had to guess all transactions incl liquidations are onchainon starknet and that would update the liqed users balance in the deposit contract
333427,blocktower is selling a lot of tokensalthough i dont know why
333428,nan
333429,speculation but not really surprising given avi left
333430,unwinding avis book
333431,quite a lot of funds unwind positions when the lead for those investments leave
333432,bless long term venture bags
333433,indeed
333434,thank you yes there at least 3 community translations 28 prs and original xml map is also being freely developed all is happening in github i also seen a cool implementation githubcomkayisweb3fromzero it has several issues but its fineim also developing githubcomoffcierciacryptoopsecselfguardroadmap check it out sir
333436,like btrfly its not the first time they have surrendered
333437,lost 80
333447,sole admin removed some context cant quite see if you are trying to make a message being something forward please just do it in a concise manner not over 10 messages thank u
333448,not sure why ur comment was removed or the context eh delta_neutral
333449,i dunno was directly responding to someone talking about me
333450,maybe more context blocktower is unwinding those positions they dont understand because i left and they dont have in house knowledge now both defi analysts also left
333451,its actually super common to offload positions when leads leave
333452,big oof
333453,avi is right the high probability of these operations is that the remaining people are not proficient in defi
333454,they bought btrfly at 500 and sold it at 100 and are now selling other positions which cost a lot
333455,in my long observation they do not sell easily and are not afraid of price so their recent actions are strange but i have found the answer
333456,aave v3 detailed report defisafety
333457,anyone here have connection to gnosis specifically wallet team i didnt write this code not fully getting the problem but you can see the issue here the devs suspect that payableaddresstransferamount is leading to out of gas problem when 1 of the addresses are a gnosis wallet here 1112 of the payable addresses are normal eoa only 1 is a gnosis
333458,
333459,former ny fed official join euler as coo
333460,ouch berlin hardfork makes payableaddresstransferamount only provide 2300 gas but it costs 2600 gas to pay a gnosis safe so you gotta do eip2930 access list stuff to prepay the gas so ugly
333461,we had the issue before where we thought the money was stuck forever
333462,
333463,glad its of use
333464,awh you made it thank you ser apprecaite what you did
333465,haha found your github and were working on a fix now glad to see youre here in lobsterdao
333466,technically its my cofounder but passed along the message
333467,cosmos og should invite here if he has tg
333468,aave v3 is live btw
333469,
333471,aave v3 ui looks really good
333474,no price shit read pinned
333475,next time mutes gamblers
333476,
333477,cannot open tho
333480,ouch
333481,seems like i gonna find work
333483,funds recovered thank you for open sourcing that fix
333484,
333485,gm sers max from backd here wanted to share that we just launched on mainnet
333486,the time has finally come backd is live on ethereum mainnet launch details and more below
333487,re aave 3 portals does this mean you can supply on one chain and borrow from another without having to do any bridging that seems too good to be true
333488,that is the goal just listened to the twitter spaces it was good
333489,true multichain stuff
333490,is this true
333491,thats how it read to me but to be fair am moron one of the cooler features to come out lately if thats real
333492,they literally unwinded their whole defi portfolio within the past few departures
333493,
333494,pool 2 was a good invention
333495,it actually is allows you to experience extreme outcomes
333496,ngl i love pool 2
333497,i write some short and sweet thread on tokenomics
333498,
333499,i hoped to come to some conclusion on where we going but i didnt i have no idea someone plz tell me
333500,looked into it
333501,looks nice
333502,but evm stack not shown in forked simulation or
333503,i guess you are looking for dapptools or foundry
333504,very interesting read serespecially part with the goals of tokenomics bootstrap liquidity user acquisition align incentives value add beyond cap table sustainabilitybut not sure is it comprehensive list
333505,thx will look into
333506,defs not comprehensive these mostly what i consider the main most important goals for tokenomics ignoring voting and stuff like that and ofc for different phases for a project
333507,is that ape coin shit real
333508,meant to share tweet but is below
333509,in case anyone wants to help with exit liquidity
333510,has any nft derived token been successful i think all the loot spin off tokens when to shit
333511,also now i know why coordinape couldnt get the ape symbol
333512,magic is doing quite well
333513,
333514,wtf
333515,the discussion is smth else
333516,that riaevangelist sounds like a complete moron
333517,they could have stated their position without turning their business into an army unit like make an informative update block ips support army or people but wtf using malware they are taking too much on them it will only help regime to prove their propaganda such steps help the dictator p to prove his point
333518,thanks for sharing olympus pro doesnt seem to be a viable alternative im currently looking into adding single sided liquidity bancor
333519,these were our experiences with olympus pro
333520,47 tokens for treasury15 for nft holders38 for bayc founders yuga labs and launch contributorsthe 38 control the majority of the votes this is not a true dao
333521,bancor certainly looks interesting theres fei too the protocol owned liquidity thing has merit but afaics its doesnt work well as something you can sell to another project between the bribes and mercenary dumps seems like youd be better off with generic lm
333524,i mean ok the 38 is 73 of the not for treasury tokens but its also not one entity its also the case for many daos look at defi
333525,the 24 are yuga and bayc founders alone which are the same people
333526,also bayc holders giving their apes and soon tkens away in discord so maybe it is smart good for security
333527,i dont know but i doubt its the same one is the company recently did investment round ne is the founders these are two very different things imho
333528,yuga raised money but only for a minor part of the company shares which implies that the bayc founders still own 80 of yuga labsand the best partweb3 and initial launch is on cex
333529,fair anyway i dont want to defend ape coin but i think its just a weird gripe that many have with distro
333530,completely agree with you
333531,at least the distro is better than most coinlist tokens that sell 05 of tokens to the communitybut for a dao i think its not good enough unless they have no voting rights dump incoming after unlock
333532,thats what makes it seem extra sus to me tbh
333533,well seems it just adds a useless file guess this is americans idea of protesting
333534,it doesnt
333535,thank you just read the review im not convinced that it would represent a significant advantage over otc deals as stated in the review you shared
333536,it wipes your drive depending on the ip
333537,the api key facilitating that has been revoked so its useless now but thats what it did
333538,comments are wrong then
333539,check the github thread
333540,
333541,
333542,thanks
333543,this comment telling that this is a harmless banner is just an attempt to present the situation in slightly different angle psyops actually it definitely removes all data and acts like a malware
333544,please now russians do the same to americans then well be forced to adopt endo
333545,if your ip is good you get a useless file if its bad ciao at least until the revoke
333546,war is not the answer starts a war
333548,
333550,
333551,looks like its a dockers pr campaign
333552,hey guys i founded tfmcom and we just launchedits 1inch for terrayou can save 100s or even 1000s on every trade on terra since liquidity is split across 3 dex excited to see the community save of course open to all feedback
333553,i havent been able to find the portals functionality in the new v3 ui
333564,yeah frig off spam
333565,thank you guys deleted spam and banned spammers ping me if you will see it again
333567,anyone heard about arable blacklisting accounts selling their staking rewards
333568,yah crazy shit arable said to blacklist bots but apparently they blacklisted normal account just selling their yieldsthats not what blockchain is abt
333569,goeth121
333570,what infra would it take to make it easy for you to run your own local version of etherscancould it be done with js on the browser you would need ur own in this case
333571,check out otterscan
333572,apparently they are double down on freezing it while the guy was just trying to get attention for dev to treat it seriously like wtf this is defi and you get blacklisted for being early and selling your yield
333573,archive node
333575,checkout otterscan i recently found about it on lobster
333576,otterscan erigon
333577,whats the deal with this erigon thing
333578,its a faster more storage efficient eth client
333579,personally i dont have 512 gb on my laptop
333580,there is also akula but i am not sure it is ready yet
333581,akula should take up 1tb
333582,basicly you need an ssd
333583,ssds are quite reasonably priced these days anyway you can probably get 2tb ssds for 150 or so
333584,what the best 4tb one that you would recommend
333585,it uses erigons data model so for pruned state it shouldnt be more than 600 gb i think
333586,archive nodes also index events it think i asked around its 1tb if u use zfs
333587,hmm yeah sounds about right
333589,wow thats awesome
333593,sooo whos gonna start lobsters of dubai
333597,i saw the tweet and the screenshot too dev was threatening the victim not to go social and complian
333599,ivangbi
333600,arable protocol blacklisted me for potential bots and quick sellers heres the full article for it if anyone knows any way to help is appreciated dont want more people falling prey to them especially when they incentivised lobsterdao members stay safespread the word if you can
333601,goeth121 please explain sir this is important
333602,wow pretty wild first time hearing projects blacklisting people for farm and dumping their tokens
333603,this sounds pretty serious thanks for update will look into removing my funds from there as well meanwhile i hope dev goeth121 steps forward and explain this the idea of protecting protocol by blacklisting traders how is this okay with the community pretty odd if you ask me
333604,didnt know they had that function inbuilt shady af
333607,they seem to just be really really scared of the sell button
333608,then they should continue and blacklist all addresses that hodls acre
333611,guys does anyone have idea of what good oracle solutions are out there apart from chainlink the chainlink solution seems very costly for small projects
333612,band
333613,uni v3 is free
333614,this
333615,all chains metis l2 is the only one with a solidly fork
333616,in
333617,you pay so much in terms of gas cost for cardinality for oracles vpepo has the lived experience of this
333618,i dont think thats really true tbh activating a lending market on euler with 144 cardinality for a 30 minute twap has ranged between 2002000 usd depending on gas costs thereafter there is almost no cost chainlink oracles can cost upto 1m a month in gas fees alone to update the chain when gas fees are high and prices are volatile
333619,it exists its a secret society right now it has only two members who postpone plan of meeting each other evry week but it exists
333620,not allowed to say more than that
333621,sourcex why are you doing this
333622,its so secretive even its members dont know they are a part of it
333624,so its joel and ms joel
333625,pyth
333627,29 prs a new one from me think anyone would be up for going through those defi papers together maybe a like a little book clubive been summarising papers about decentralised collab as well daoistrycom also fundraising on gitcoin and im putting a reading group together so we each share highlights and summaries
333628,might be offpiste but i found this old post on oracle mechanisms interesting
333629,wait thats not true you are not accounting for the quotes you need to do in order to get that twap its not just the initialization
333630,quoting from univ3 costs about 60k gas on each interaction im not sure how euler uses those quotes but it is being expensive its just that now the cost is transferred to the user
333631,and for reference im pro univ3 oracles p but that statement is kinda tricky to make
333632,yes thats fair theres a cross contract call and some computation let me check those gas estimates though i would still contend that the net cost of a uni v3 oracle is much much cheaper than a 3rd party provider would be interesting to see some research on this
333633,imho the most straight forward example to this is would be seeing a comparison between ens using chainlink current vs using univ3 for quoting their pricing
333634,and for reference you could create a much more efficient chainlink style oracle with uniswap v3s oracle
333635,chainlink can choose to subsidise their oracle costs in the short term wouldnt be an entirely fair comparison in my opinion
333636,the thing is that with chainlink chainlinks holders pays up for the whole party while on uniswap v3 each user has to pay for their own drink
333637,and for reference i also like chainlinks oracles theres clear tradeoffs between the two
333638,yep depends on usage you could cache the uniswap quote and reuse it if there was sufficient demand
333639,btw how does euler use the quoting from univ3 is it on each interaction from borrow lending
333640,i view chainlink as the unifying oracle that can bring enterprises to use defi as well
333641,thats chainlinks moat
333642,chainlink quoting for a ens registration is about 6k gas 10x less vs univ3 quoting
333643,which tool is that
333644,interesting how do you arrive at this is it because they have enterprise partners as oracle data providers
333645,tenderly
333646,lets see what happens when they make users pay for the usage
333647,
333648,yep pretty much we optimise some parts through caching though on euler you can build your own batch transactions so you can deposit multiple assets borrow multiple assets take out a longshort position mint leverage etc etc in a single batch transaction from our ui you can save a tonne of gas doing this
333649,true because 1 quote vs 10 interactions
333650,thats a really cool design tbh
333651,thanks
333652,you can launch your own oracles and pay for yourself to yourselfnot a bit issue for the teams
333653,precisely enterprise middleware market is hugely untapped
333654,under the hood we have a generalised flash loan function that allows users not just to borrow something without collateral but to do any combination of complex legal operations we simply defer the checks on their liquidity status until the end of the batch and then switch them back on and check the protocol and user are as they should be
333655,keep3r oracle was maintaining something like 40 feeds and the cost was in the 100k range monthly
333656,wen lobster eli5 euler session
333657,not every team has 100k to throw into maintaining some feeds
333658,1
333660,michael twitter space
333661,tbh michael has been quite active and open to all the questions here 3 i would say he has been doing a long term eli5 p
333662,can i not try to get free tokens in peace
333663,wdym costly what
333664,yup euler_mab is kul
333665,any time sir ask away well start doing more twitter spaces etc from next week once weve had an audit back this week and ready to move forward with some stuff
333666,euler community call on monday at 5 pm utc
333667,may be some news about eul on the call
333669,fun fact borrowing on euler would be cheaper than aave v3 if they wouldnt use univ3 as an oracle tradeoff between accepting long tail assets vs limit to chainlinks asset list
333670,tenderly is sooo good
333671,havent you guys considered doing a multiple oracle setup for something like this like using univ3 as default but having a governanceenabled switch for well established coins that tenderly example is a usdc borrow which could switch it to chainlink or other provider
333672,interesting stuff oxmikko apeir99n
333673,we have yes may still go that way we focussed on shipping something that minimises governance but ultimately governance could vote in an alternative
333674,shill time some frens already did it for their own protocol so feel free to check it out whenever you guys start going that route p
333675,oh we know the mean finance guys already talked to them about uni v3 oracle manipulation costs they were actually working on something similar to our tool here
333676,nan
333677,thanks for sharing ur story read ur twitter and screenshot very unfair to us investors for doing whats naturally normal
333678,the actions seen f scammy from the arable side re it wasnt vetted by lobsterdao in case someone says it but the airdrop was quite nice have to give it that however lets not turn the context into oh us poor investors u r gamblers thats a bit too plebbish still shit decision w blacklists
333679,so what about this layer 0 thing never heard of
333680,nan
333681,primordialaa is the chad behind it interoperability very novel tbh mabye he can expand a bit
333682,please do everyone talking about it on twitter since yesterday would be nice to get some info from the source
333684,14k gas iirc with the recent ahem cruft theyve added to the api still practically nothing compared an xswap
333685,pampu
333686,a few useful resourceswebsite layerzeronetworkdiscord medium post great high level overview demo
333687,theres also stargate finance which launches today and was built by layerzero labsstargatefinance
333688,naive question whats the difference between rune and layer zero are they trying to solve the same problem
333689,rune uses txorigin
333690,the defiant also posted a video on layerzero a few months ago
333691,on a serious note the article classifies rune as a middle chain where authority is delegated to the middle chain and because a central point of failure layer zero proposes an ultra light node which has the same security guarantees as a running a light client on both chains which is more secure than middle chain but also expensive
333692,layerzero is the underlying messaging protocol so maybe better to compare with stargatethis is good for describing some trade offs in architecting bridges
333693,very cool thanks
333694,anyone planning to go to eth amsterdam
333695,will be there many will be
333696,if u find the main telegram chat for the events please do shoot it here
333697,i will be there for the weekend
333698,how do these conferences work actually
333699,theyve made it unreasonably difficult to find some information on the event lal
333700,but side tracking im hosting an after party on the 18th of april after the first day of eth ams its right next to the event location also right next to the amsterdam stock exchange can i dump gform in here
333701,found one side event tg but pretty much dead it seems
333702,
333704,also
333707,just thinking out loud but how about reserving like 10 tickets for ppl that holds lobster nfts first come first serve
333708,i like your thinking
333709,oils up bike to get there faster
333710,dev doorman extractable value
333711,heute nicht sven marquardt
333712,hi lobsters i tried to get some eth from kiln testnet faucet but it didnt work could you please tell me can i mine it
333713,was reservering 10 per certain communities sure thing also for our lovely crustaceans
333714,fyi drinkies will be free from 1830 till 2130
333715,legend lmk if youre looking for sponsors happy to help as blockart
333716,nice got a venue locked already
333717,yessir
333718,am sponsoring the event my self entirely just wanted to give back to the community during these volatile times
333719,what a hero
333720,so if anyone is interested pls send dm i have a gform to keep track of how many spots we have left
333721,due to free drinks we had to cap it at 100
333722,king
333723,anyone knows if its possible to track graph queries count hosted vs decentralized service real time wanna see how the migration is going
333724,like this
333725,likely wont be possible i have been checking for this myself
333726,what did this young lad do to get so many ape tokens
333727,crazy i think one of the utility token for nft
333728,i thought the abracadabra degen box would cause anchor to get rektnow theyre on avax
333729,came to do this saw everyone had already done p
333730,arbitraged the nftx pool
333731,
333732,he cant keep getting away with it
333733,yeah theres a governance conference
333734,nftx made 280k on fees for that
333735,the mev guy got like 1m out of it at current rate
333736,think they only made 750k they had to buy an ape to before that tx to make it work
333740,name a better duo than bayc holders and losing money 20k ape tokens already sent to the contract address by mistake lmao
333741,in full baycholder style
333742,
333743,omfg
333744,yeah but they did keep the bayc right
333745,ah no
333746,so yeah
333747,1m 1 bayc profit
333748,wait no he still has 200k on the univ2 pool
333749,bleh around 1m
333751,
333752,omfggggggggg
333753,so roughly 10044286
333756,oops gas wei is 200 now thanks ape l2s get more adoptions
333757,someone just needs a snipe bot to catch out those who are listing their apes at floor prices but have unclaimed apecoins there will definitely be a few im sure
333758,is this only 0006 eth in profit for that bot
333759,
333760,i will be there too
333761,not really new and tbh this is one of the more fair scams that exist people get punished for trying to steal other peoples money
333762,true true definitely agree
333763,some arbitrageurs have arbitraged about 60564 ape tokensabout 400000through the method of buys vault token redeems entire pool claims airdrop of 60k ape resupplys the pool through flash loans wu blockchain wublockchain mar 17 2022
333764,oxmaki trying to figure out how the avoid collusion on the relayer and oracle doesnt seem to be explained in the paper
333766,which paper is this do you mind sharing
333768,ser see above convo yes but is oke to double post this one is a cool post
333769,layerzero
333770,say you take chainlink a coinbasesushiuniswapaavecompoundlidoetc relayer security would be if you take a lambda oracle malicious relayer security is but the end user is the one always picking what he wants to use similar to a rpc endpoint on metamask so this mitigate the risk aspect
333771,the outcomes are basically honest honest honest dishonest dishonest honest dishonest dishonest in the case that both the relayer and the oracle are honest the transaction is validated onchain and forwarded to the destination application in the case oracle is honest and relayer is dishonest fails to validate oracle dishonest and relayer is honest fails to validate so now the only case for malaction is the case in which both the oracle and the relayer are in active malicious collusion together now what this means is that first off say for example you choose chainlink for your oracle that means any malicious action is first predicated on defeating the chainlink don meaning that in the worst case the case the relayer is fully colluding with the oracle it still reduces to being as secure as the oracle the second thing is that even in the extreme case where you do have this malicious oracle who is colluding directly with a relayer say relayer a all risk is 100 siloed to the oracle relayer a pairing anybody using relayer bz unaffected anybody relaying their own tx unaffected anybody using oracle bz unaffected
333772,from primordial maki explanation is the tldr but that one made me understand it the most
333773,thank you both that makes it easier
333774,
333775,
333776,nan
333777,always trying to tone it down so we dont lose anyone in the thought process but the siloed aspect is most important to understand here
333778,and this is what make the system flexible and agnostic for the longterm
333779,thats an interesting model with 52k nft owners i wont expect significant price floor tho
333780,governance later on
333781,22 for common ones and about 100 for the rare nfts
333782,is there an eli5 about what yearn does i feel like their docs assume you already have some idea about what yearn does while delving into it
333783,take yo money do fun thing for more money give you it back with a little cut on top
333784,how are the fun things agreed upon
333785,strategists argue with each other get vetted for feasibility and safety and then go ahead
333786,two peer reviews and a security review
333787,you can see all the strategies and descriptions here
333788,ah okay so the strategies still needs to be manually implemented for a vault its not like the protocol itself automatically decides on opportunities
333789,correct
333790,this is why strategists get paid the big dollars for doing the fun things theyre too bigbrain to get automated yearn needs to retain top talent for it to continue to grow
333791,kk now it makes more sense what would be the simplest example of a strategy
333792,take your eth go to aave deposit and borrow against
333793,read these
333794,ah i see okay so essentially the yv tokens are like uni v2 lp tokens that determines your portion of tokens in the vault and you earn via withdrawing your tokens from the pool as the size of the pie grows
333795,is there anyone from big dapps like uni curve etc that use graph procotol who can speak about their thoughts on migration to graphs decentralized service like are users willing to pay for it and can we assess the speed at which things are moving over
333796,
333797,interesting stuff actually
333798,interesting but a bit over complicated explanations with no need ir swaps soon tm
333799,
333802,whos studied yearn here wanted your thoughts on something
333803,can you count on users to change oraclesrelayers though
333804,not users rather protocols
333805,oofff dont youre going to get yourself killed
333806,lmeow stargate 2 auction
333807,hm
333808,
333809,stargatefinance you dont know it
333810,2 wallets
333811,to be expected so much for a fair launch
333812,stargate botted sale
333813,wait nothing was put in place to mitigate this no floating smth perminute reducing price etc
333814,lol 2 wallets filled 25 mil
333815,yes
333816,1 did 20m
333817,didnt we invent lbps last year for this
333818,oxmaki ser

333820,we will have bonding curve with price from 05 to 15
333821,we are live with gro protocol team rn ask questions in lobsterdao
333822,ser
333823,not my fault
333824,their team didnt learn from jonedao
333825,congrats
333826,bonding curve should be easier
333827,nan
333828,complete joke this ido
333829,aint an ido
333830,i did bring the need for a wl but too short notice still should be fine on the bonding curves
333831,hopefully
333832,bonding curve round
333833,2 people now own 10 of the supply nice
333834,whats the point of an auction if you design it like that might as well just have sold it privately
333835,congrats ser 1 sec 25m
333836,this must be a full refund ser
333837,i guess the argument is those 2 people could have used 100 wallets each for the same result
333838,ivan we are talking about stablecoin yields on this gro call ur favorite
333839,26 seconds
333840,inside job
333842,expensive for an inside job
333843,paradigm and a16z back ethereum scaling startup optimism at 165b valuation link
333844,the ethereum scaling startup tells techcrunch theyve closed a 150 million series b funding round coled by andreessen horowitz and paradigm at a 165 billion valuation
333846,why is everybody so rich fuck
333847,lets pivot gearbox to gearscale
333848,nobody asks for 6 supply from cexes ser blz dont spread bs
333849,scaling l2 lending now on
333850,we are honest this is our curse
333852,l2 lending for animal nfts in metaverse using option vaults
333853,unironically bullish
333854,i know the deals and been on projects side since 2018 so yes
333855,unfair
333857,must sprinkle dao tooling on top for added valuation multiple
333858,no ofc not rug shitcoin projects give more ofcbut saying that is norm is not correct
333859,honestly i would consider doing a refund or something like that
333863,bonding curves going live
333864,meh dont buy that narrative but whatever
333865,are they called bonding curves because they make you do dumb financial moves and now you are literallyin bonds
333866,they knew that this would happen otherwise theyre incompetent af
333867,yeah i know but like just dont do such an auction and sell private makes no sense
333868,this is miso all over again
333869,what is this bonding stuff
333870,i am buying a shitcoin or no
333871,you should be pivoting
333872,92m raise for mina by ftx ventures and three arrows capital
333873,150m raise for optimism by a16z
333874,choose the chain to buy
333875,price from 05 to 15
333876,arent these ape tokenomics a bit ridiculous
333877,avax bnb ftm matic arbit opti
333878,tell me about it
333879,where is miso
333880,should have used copperlaunch
333881,you are not going to get rich searching for miso just saying
333882,copperlaunch being used for something else im cooking this was lockdrop for liquidity high lockup was supposed to be deterrent for botting
333883,expectation wasnt to sell everything in 1 block tbh
333884,it had the same problems with whales
333885,shit happens
333886,150mln raised and 6mln uniswap vulme on oe has hmm
333887,what is the price difference between the insider 2 wallets and the bonding now
333889,their tokens locked
333890,usdc bonds at 083 so over 3x
333891,their tokens are locked for 12 months
333892,paper gains
333893,ah ok bueno better
333894,buying on opti is giving best price now
333895,russian central bank gives sberbank licence to issue exchange digital assets link
333896,very cool
333897,so pissed off about this1 they said they not going to do a token and give out all the proceeds as retro public goods instead2 somehow the establishment managed to get into their hands on our revolting equity we where supposed to have ourselves wtf
333898,i am not sure what r pissed off about
333899,cuz this and starkware equity is going to be worth hundreds of billions
333900,ok sure and
333901,he wants a piece of it also
333902,instead of giving it out to the ppl its going to be given to a select group of already well established rich ppl
333903,does this surprise you
333904,pisses me the fuck off
333905,but will the people provide the same value
333906,what value do you really need to provide seriously
333907,i suppose thats a case in point
333908,its objectively better to have backing by people with networks and resources than 100k people asking when moon
333909,numba goes downdev do someting
333910,sorry but this is true yes
333911,these are products that already have pmf
333912,they can succeed with my little sister backing them
333913,this is unfair fud
333914,better for who
333915,im just as valuable as paradigm
333916,the people who need funding
333917,this is not the first licence the first one i think was for the russian nickel mining company that was aiming to issue tokens based on nickel unit or something like that actuality digital finance assets in their legal framework are not the strictly public sitcoins they are sort of private shitcoins on the private blockcains also public blockcains are somewhere here so not very excited on these licences
333918,and that is why theyre not asking you
333919,honestly right now the people are the best way to get regulatory shielding if you want to do a token if no token then why involve people
333920,its also easier to just raise from a few private parties than dealing with the organizational and legal hassle of issuing a token raising from retail
333921,i am not saying your stance is neccessarily wrong from a crypto ethos point of view just that for practical reasons it makes less sense
333922,sure there are reasons that led up to the decision but the results are fcked up
333923,for you maybe
333924,we missed out big on the thing we came to do in the first place
333925,not for them
333926,i think we see more of this as we become more mainstream
333927,for most in crypto yes
333928,ok lets end this convo feels plebbish sorry wanna be in these deals work more ser
333929,there are a number of high quality projects in the market trading _below_ recent vc rounds
333930,this too
333931,gib alfafa ser
333932,yeh u think starkware is worth less then 4bln common and optimism less then 1b
333933,bored apes def worth 8bil
333934,what are you working on if you can share
333935,all in 1inch
333936,i bought unity stock at the peak which is now fucked by over 50 down damn vcs right
333937,what im saying is vc isnt risk free arbitrage between private and public markets
333938,tbh i dunno what their plans are but depending on lockups and stuff who knows if optimism is worth 1bln
333939,how is that the equivalent
333940,at these valuations its not anymore as easy indeed athough vc gps wont lose lps will be rekt likely who knows muh time horizon its their choices
333941,to me its reasonably clear that zk non zk rollups
333942,a new project
333943,not really theres stuff u cant do on zk
333944,for example sir
333945,no one likes to be excluded but it is what it is
333946,vc is eating all of our lunch and sticking it in your face is what im saying
333947,just trade it on market when it launches
333948,you are free to join or launch your own fund
333949,everyone here to make money there is no our lunch
333950,ok this is just hardcore fucking pleb stuff at this point
333951,done fin bans next
333952,leaving aside the other discussion what things can u do on optimistic rollups that u cant on zk
333953,ye this is fine to continue
333954,wait so its like 10m raised per chain
333955,too pissed off to type feel free to ask me later
333956,private transactions by default
333957,substantial tx fee reduction
333958,yesadd stablecoin to stargate bonding curves and receive stg tokens while building stargates protocol owned liquidity
333959,but do u buy literally or just rent your usdc for x period
333960,likely that to get your usdc back you need to put stg back into pool
333961,so yes you get to rent usdc but to take back collateral you give underlying
333962,ah gotcha thank u
333963,which is same as sale is theres an external market for underlying stg ill check
333964,dont thank me pivot gearbox
333966,oxmaki could correct idk
333967,in other news burgers led by the stupid bitch warren are doing some bs againnot passed just for hearing or voting idk the usual drama of that old dumb bitch
333968,bots and quick sellers has taken out more than half of liquidity out and we have enabled reportingfreezing system for actors who are threatening the protocolbot users cant be unfrozen and serious users will be unfrozen after mvp is out via governance proposal and if its frozen by mistake it will be unfronzen instantlywe have been not taking care of liquidity for a while but we got several messages from governance members to take care of it including apr reductionfyi this is for protocols health until we finalize mvp and reduce sell pressue team didnt sell any of the tokens on the liquidity and recently to cover the loss of users by quick sellers and few rule violaters had to do buy back some of the tokens to secure the users
333969,some people are saying the project is centralized right now yes it is after we build mvp and ensure that protocol is 100 secure we will burn all centralized ownership or delegate the ownership to governancegovernance members asked to quickly act rather than waiting for 12 weeks for all the members votes and i agree with their opinion
333970,she really is a hateful and stupid old hag i wish shed fuck off and go talk about indigenous issues or whatever tf else
333971,ser dont pick on other people like this no need just hate on this old shit bag
333972,warren were talking about same person
333973,sorry dosent change the fact that my funds are still hostage i was not notified that early adopters will be frozen under the condition that mvp completes it wasnt in the terms and agreementsreducing your apr is within your rights continuing to freeze my funds is a dck move
333974,ok lemme continue slaving in the gulags for crimes that i have never committed and was held against my will and i should to this day stand trial against a jury of unknowns to clear my innocence
333975,1 how can rules be broken if the rules are baked into the contract2 holding funds hostage without any prior notice is unethicalillegal3 number go up number go down you must be new here
333976,precisely so if your mvp continues to delay im unable to withdraw any of my funds the fact of holding me hostage itself is a crime this isnt an update its a reminder that your decision hasnt changed one bit unforgivable
333977,some cool stuff for the evm community
333978,a16z is backing almost every single l2 solution hegdged bets
333979,since you have already taken out more than what you have put from other users liquidity by selling from day 1 and currently you are scaring other usersplease share your buysell analytics to our community and see how they act on your analytics if community is still happy with you you will instantly get back otherwise wait for mvp mainnetwe are finalizing mvp testnet competition and if everything is okay after audits we will launch sooncompetition will be in 2 weeks we are not delaying just follow our daily updates channel for mvp
333980,u have names for the other l2s being funded
333981,they also backed matter labs
333982,but back in november
333983,if hackers take out money by following the contract rules is it ethical not only contract people should think of protocols healthespecially at this phase when we are not complete mvp is still in progress
333985,your approach is completely wrong fren unfortunately its not up to you how users behave or use their funds and by doing this i dont think you will have many users
333986,starkware zksync i believe
333987,why the fk does that even matter lmao mans farmed some tokens sold some of his yields which is the whole point of yield farming anyway and then you want the communitys opinion on this
333988,he did no wrong anyway if you think the sell pressure is from the fact that your mvp isnt even up which essentially makes your token pretty much pointless at this stage right then why not only have the token later idgi
333989,wont be surprised if arbitrum announces them as investors soon although their last raise was quite sizable
333992,a16z isnt invested in sw sequoia is

333994,didnt sell from day 1 deposited and reinvested for a week straight
333996,i stand corrected
333997,someone should do zkor for the ppl by the ppl protocol
333998,there are some guys working on zkoru zero knowlegde optimistic roll up which are still community based
333999,to prevent hackers taking out more money than they put in you should consider disallowing token selling at the contract level
334000,it would be much more effective than locking peoples funds manually
334001,link
334002,
334003,
334004,bruhthe way u manage ur project is highly unethical why not just blacklist every hodler that way no1 will sell and u guys will be a successoh wait thats a honeypot
334005,seems like a privacy txn protocol
334006,reviewed it ages ago iirc they scale via optmistic roll up they construct zk proof in the roll ups for privacy
334007,blacklisting dumpers is insanity i hope people avoid a project doing this like the plague going forward
334010,they are happy with me wheres my refund
334012,not a surprise after this
334013,maybe you shouldnt have launched a meme high apr staking farm if you were worried about people dumping their staking rewards anyway i think the community are clear here give the guy his funds back and rethink your approach
334015,then why even bother launching token when your mvp is not out and youre afraid of the market might as well work on your mvp first
334016,how does dumping the coin hurt the protocol health
334017,substitute protocol health for price value of team tokens kek
334018,ontario residents restricted from using binance platform link
334019,the ontario securities commission has been sparring with binance for a while
334020,if you make a mistake in your tokenomics and mechanism decisions that by abusing your own protocol you could correct im of the opinion that you should just suffer the consequences failure of mechanism design isnt a valid reason to forgo the principles of the industry if he was contractually obligated not to sell thats a different matter but if the dude was using the system as intended and youre stopping him from doing so because it hurts your bottom line thats incredibly unethical and probably illegal
334021,what principles lol time and time agen u trust nonanon devs
334023,arable convos are now not permitted the behavior from their end has been malicious or rather negligent as one can see expressed unilaterally fin on
334024,tldr
334025,quickly from my understanding not an expert it takes the notion of evm precompiles and adds state access to it allowing more functionality for devs can diminish gas cost etc
334032,the good tldrstateful precompiles can modify balances readwrite the storage of other contracts and could even hook into external storage outside of the bounds of the evms merkle trie
334033,the bad tldr
334034,to reiterate this is a dangerous capability and should be used carefully if a developer builds a nondeterministic stateful precompile execution of their modified evm will naturally be nondeterministic this could result in different validators disagreeing about whether a block is valid or not
334035,looks neat from an engineering trickery perspective but also looks like a disaster waiting to happen regarding both intentional and unintentional exploits
334036,is someone interested in bean this is an interesting design
334038,it is very interesting but i think search for previous mentions
334039,enlighten us
334040,
334041,would yall like to share why you find it interesting or just refer to the docs when asked
334042,hey i was just responding when you said enlighten us i didnt think it was a bean money talk i hardly understand it lol and im not some bot in here to promote it
334043,thats why im asking for trhx01 to enlighten us why he finds it an interesting design here to learn
334045,i dont like bean tbh the pod line is very ponzish
334046,supply has been flat for months see dune which means people are stuck in line only realize yield through new seniorage but seems theres no demand
334047,this is where the concept of trading the pod is interesting to me if you overlyconfident sowed while the line was already super booked thank you can still exit at a discount
334048,agree on the need to increase demandusage its the same challenge all stablecoin are facing integration and trust from public
334051,whats interesting to me is to have a completely autonomous design for a decentralized stable cointhis is the why
334053,looks like those who participated in the bonded curves will have an option to buy at 25
334054,so more money being raised right
334055,they already are at 80mm in protocol owned liquidity and yes
334056,more money for the bridge of bridges
334057,cant blame them due to the fact they need a fkload of capital to bootstrap for heavy usage right quite capital intensive same as amms imho why its hard to do such protocols
334058,
334059,that arca proposal must be the dumbest i am sure i know what i am doing proposal to date was very surprised they would do such a thing tbh
334061,when you guys use metamask with ledger anyone else have the signing bug out like 100 times before it works any work arounds for this
334062,how silly of me to think the actual answer was because we got such a huge discount that there was no way wed lose money on it glad they cleared that up
334063,are there any web3defi developer centric podcasts out there
334071,zero knowledge is good not much defi though
334072,earlier on this was true it does have a wider variety now though tarun and sunny from osmosis have been on a couple of times and tarun actually co hosts it now
334073,1 year lockup followed by 6 months of linear vesting moneys on them getting rekt eventually
334075,it happened quite a bit with zapper a few days ago but nowhere else
334076,thats solid for current buyers but also still depends on the valuation they got in
334077,btw i have neither criticism for layer0 nor any particular knowledge of the situation i just found it ironic to have a ginormous twitter thread when we all know the actual answer is they thought they could make money by going in pre public sale also fair chance they are selling enough of the locked up tokens on the secondary market to do rather well even if the price crashes
334078,damn people actually read the whole thing
334079,i honestly would have been more inclined to read if they just posted a link to an article
334082,nan
334083,if beans trades at 1 were in a state of equilibrium what happens if beans trades below 1this is a depeg event in this case we have to incentivize the buying of beans how do you do it with debt when 1 beans 1 beanstalk issues debt promising to pay people back more beans in the futurethat promise doesnt sound like something that scales
334084,is this basis dollar or something
334085,yeah it sounds like the bond part of basisio
334086,does anyone knows app to zap eth to univ3 ntf in one tx
334087,ive seen this but cant remember where
334088,beans sound like a complete nonsense i would strongly advise not getting involved
334089,can you elaborate why
334090,this is how i understand it they are basically printing money where collateral is liquidity but who reasonable would provide liquidity to it decentralization aint big enough aspect compared to the risk of it going to 0 compared to usdc or usdt imo
334091,i read through the wp earlier my understanding is they only print money when there is demandthats when token crosses over the peg i think that is a key differentiator from earlier ponzi designs that collapsed on their own weight the way they incentivize longterm liquidity is also interestingyour share of new minting is somewhat depended on how long you lp i think it is pretty interesting but purely relies on economic incentivizes and i am not fully convinced if it can easily scale but i dont think this will collapse because of debt as they dont print more tokens unless above peg
334092,the way i look at it our investors are essentially funding public goods optimism is structured as a pbc meaning that we have no obligation to privilege shareholder profit over public good fundingim just a pleb but seems to me the leadership is determined to make sure the community benefits before investor do of course we believe these two are not mutually exclusive we already gave 1m to fund open source projectsas for zk vs optimistic rollup its not like most people believe see this thread for a technical take
334093,why are the investors in it if not financial gain
334094,they want to benefit but we can make sure the community benefits first via public goods
334095,i think i speak for a lot of ppl we want to take a significant part of the dao and think the ppl are more deserving and valuable to you then ur investors weve been here a long while personally for me its 9 years and it hurts to see the vcs from the valley who just started to take interest in the last years come and eat our lunch or are very critical part of the crypto ecosystem especially the one with the best branding and team
334096,wait see
334097,i think the ppl are more deserving and valuable to you then ur investors personal curiosity why and how
334098,cuz they dont need the access vc give them you can literally dm anyone from the industry and theyll answer uespecially if ur optimism
334099,there product already has pmf and its not like vcs are going to give more useful advice then u can find in this chat group they know less about web 30 then the ppl here
334100,isnt that survivorship bias the people dont care about the ones that never got the clout to reach that point
334101,dont understand
334102,
334103,were talking about optimism taking vc money specificly
334104,your justification is they survived therefore they dont need vcs
334105,but they did were talking about this specific case
334106,heh carry on
334108,crv
334111,hi degensive one question with apecoin flashloanwhy didnt he put bayc token instead of nft in first step i think he could pay fee by putting more bayc token instead of his nft
334112,i need to ask a few questions to someone who is using coinbase frequently dm me if you could help me understand a few things
334113,nan
334114,founders care about ape and investment but forget about their own project development
334115,this is not going to be strong enough my feeling on this setup is people building them forget to factor in the powerful effect of people not wanting to buy stuff that is going down catching knives
334116,potential options1 could add a gamified element for below peg buying that hooks a dopamine loop2 consider single sided staking to break lps and get some price appreciation back above peg3 if you have time to build and you are on a chain or l2 that is not over built and you think you can get traction build a rev generating product and use those finds to buy back the peg tokenremember in order for this peg token to last it needs to be more attractive to potential investors than whatever it is pegged to through a combo of the aggregate of incentives utility brand speculation
334117,hi guys i am searching about aptos any alpha bout this
334118,does anyone know who was the other party in this trade from the crypto relief fund they reportedly traded usdc for usd
334120,ig they didnt really trade with anyone but just redeemed usdc for usd
334121,this is a degenbet at the moment if you give money to the protocol sow it will pay you back about 70 times your bet weather but you will have to wait your turn it seems to me that if you give now you will have to wait until the protocol has issued 14b bean
334122,which is likely never going to happen if people are reasonable
334123,if people are reasonable
334124,you can also buy existing protocol debt for x cents on the from others holding that debt there is a liquid market where the debt actually changes hands
334125,also sowing right now is not the reasonable thing to do and i dont understand why people are doing it price is oscillating around 1 which means you should either single side stake the token or lp
334126,they have single sided staking already
334127,dont really like single sided staking
334128,
334129,
334130,cant argue much w this tbh
334131,their doc is a shit
334132,a bridge project which doesnt support crosschain transfer of its token lol
334133,taking money from randoms on the internet is a huge regulatory overhead for a company thats why you go anon or do it through a dao
334134,hello guys what is the best resource for a beginner to learn about all protocols like yearn balancer curve i want to learn as much as i can there are so many topics coins tokens but i am finding it difficult from where to start and what are the resources from beginners to advanced point of view for someone who wants to learn everything crypto
334135,please help me and guide me the best resources
334136,you go read their docs on gitbook see some youtube vieos finematics whiteboard crypto justin bram content and then just try to consume all at once before things start making sense do not watch 99 of the youtube because they are shilling scams
334137,i believe its actually going to be enabled today
334138,i have seen all finematics videos and have understood most of it from beginning to end and wants to list of best resources to read
334139,it seems all scattered for me
334140,finding the best resource is taking more time then learning it
334141,so wants help who can navigate me to the best resources and after that its me and my hard work
334142,then go specific now literally google yearn docs and stuff like that go to docs sections on each protocol site scroll through check thedailyape and read discussions here and start commenting once your understanding gets deep enough
334143,scattered is correct read all of it read here its all 247 changing shit actually
334146,ps now please stop flooding w same questions enough info was given
334147,joel_john how can i recomemnd ur shit if u no buy domain on time ser
334148,its a dns error decentralisedcosubstackcom
334149,ill hyperlink lobster and daily ape in the links secyion shortly
334150,udaymaheshwari his crap is decent to read too
334151,so this is now much safer phew ok
334152,you are just mad they dont take lobsters in that pool
334153,lolll
334154,yes i forget about stg tokens only adding liquidity and using bridge for farming zro tokens airdrop maybe
334155,checked and noticed that there is no mkr as a collateral for daihard to find an answer why mkr cant be collateral for daianyone knows whyon forum its just back your debt with your own equity trick reason
334156,that is the reason yes
334158,thanks ivan
334159,alexcrowme a few members are posting educating helping on their own merits publicly on twitter already in here there were lengthy discussions before but trying not to steer it again thx
334160,but at the same time snx collateralized susd by the same cdp algo or am i too low iq pleb sorry for spamming with such q just curious what is not allowed in defi and whythanks
334161,maker are very careful and sometimes are called boomer for that they might be completely right finance rules wise but some say they play by an 100 year old rule book whereas the fed is even more degen that a crypto protocol now
334162,thanks ivanrecent discussions on the maker forum is also informative about this topic
334163,downward spiral risk when things goes down bad incentive design for mkr holders to deal with risk parameters less focus on governance for mkr token holders
334164,just because you can doesnt mean you should
334165,i am not really buying the gov token holders incentive cause 90 is always just random holders and any system is governed by a good wellmeaning elite but technically ye you are right kind ser
334166,mkr holders voting to raise stability fee for mkr vaults would be a fun debate to watch at least
334167,this is 100 the sticking point in my mindive wondered if it would be feasible to tie the repegging mechanism to an entirely separate robust project that was somehow not correlated to the first one so you could participate in helping to repeg without having to overcommit to a protocol that might be in a death spiral
334168,getting people to commit is its own utility without that its just a question of wen next hotness
334169,what does the second one option mean
334170,makes sense gas now is cheap though thanks to the bulls taking some rest
334171,isnt that only for solana sir
334172,thanks sir
334173,
334174,damn bribes we winning
334178,
334179,damn maker becoming more degen
334180,ellipsis v2 coming guys did you see
334181,are they now forking curve but v2
334182,these are just some musings re what is needed if you do not have a mechanism similar to ampleforth supply contracts when below peg hedge fund managers or benevolent whales persons revenue streams treasury with extra yield new users piling in
334183,a new ellipsis
334184,wait is that a llama
334185,is it possible for someones first transaction across any chain to receive fund through synapse bridge
334186,cant wait for ldo and rpl bribes for curve stethrocketpooleth
334187,is anybody knows why ape mevor used his nft instead of bayc tokenactually he could buy bayc token for the flashloan fee
334188,
334189,what do you mean exactly on synapse you can define a destination address ie using addy a to bridge to a different change and send it to addy b
334190,yea i guess i didnt see that information in the logs of the transaction or maybe i missed it but if you use the syn api it shows who initiated the transaction
334191,avax tx of gohm if you look at the input data the first topic 0 shows address to
334192,and from address is obviously just the address that initiated the transfer
334193,
334194,i was looking at this transaction this morning
334195,
334196,can you guys go to decentralisedco and give me a thumbs down emoji if its not loading for you
334197,
334199,me too ser
334200,is there a decentralized stablecoin maxi group out there we shipped a fun tool token gating with nor to remove members from the community secretely holding centralized stablecoins or any unholy assets
334201,if you look at tx on the initial chain you can find to address both in the transaction data and in event emitted by synapse bridge contractso while a fresh address can be funded with both gas and tokens this way this is not mixer by any means everything is very easily traceable
334202,thank you ended up using the synapse api and like you said was super easy to find the originator great api by the way
334203,do you guys think vetokens is the next big trend like bonding in 2021
334204,been around for a while now youre only hearing about it because the sleepy lumbering giants are finally making moves platypus i think has the best model where ve power is soulbound and nontransferable should make for some good governance
334207,i am pretty ve tokens predates bonding by atleast an year
334208,i mean about how they are getting wide adoption
334209,vetokenomic adds more sense to just governance tokens
334210,i would argue that platypus is a step back as they introduce what is called loyalty shares in tradfi seems less efficient all around
334212,hi sers anyone knows if there are other blockchains other than solana with the nomempool concept
334213,dont see 914 tweets how to make it supeleveraged
334214,hmm i think iota and their tangle dag doesnt have a mempool concept
334215,but i dont really follow it so could be wrong
334216,my fav iota concept is when it goes down for two weeksrevolutionary
334220,taxes depositing eth to aave and receiving aeth clearly tax laws at least in the us are dogshit and have yet to apply to defii can get down with a capital gain or loss when it comes to trading to another token coin or usd on a cex that makes sense i had x and i got y i made a gain or a losswhen it comes to platforms like aave yes my eth is in a smart contract and i received aeth as a marker or recepit but i never actually disposed of the eth since only my pks can retrieve the eth when i burn the aeth looking at it through the lense of a 90 year old dinosaur in congress i can see why aeth looks like a new token but its not how do you guys treat this on your taxes if this was actually the law of the land defi wouldnt function imagine someone with eth from 2015 using thier assets to get a loan like people use stocks to get loans in tardfi and now they have a massive capital gain bc they got a receipt token but where is the capital gain they didnt get usd and they didnt dispose of their 2015 eth
334221,i am treating it as a deposit and not a trade personally
334222,us tax laws are insane w all this writeoff stuff and capital gains calculations is a nightmare sorry to hear suggest not using some blabla software but getting an accountant seek one that gets this if you made any substantial amount but sorry this tax stuff wont be discussed in lobsters cause it was touched upon already but there was no good reply because it is too case by case anyway you cant just say oh i treat it this way ser anyway ctrlf on some tax convos previously if you want fin
334223,ive gotten 3 different numbers from 3 different accountants all varying widely
334224,its a nightmare bullshit been there done that eventually have to make a subjective decision of which path you feel safe going with aggressive planning super selfcucking or thinking you are in the middle line every lawyer will saying different its indeed hard at least in europe non capital gains jurisdictions the issue then comes on whether you claim it as income as investments and how the authorities will really treat it anyway seek a few opinions if you want to feel safer and go with that nothing else to do
334225,late but not too late i will be there for a long planning to meet many of you
334226,i usually choose the middle of road one if irs wants to audit my many wallets across 8 chains from staking buying lping farming etc then feel free
334227,lesson at the end of the day is just be like ivangbi and hold only stables
334228,they make you do the work ya know
334229,the trick to being ivan is losing the keys to your assets not just holding stables even the fed holds stables thats no big deal lost keys are the secret sauce
334230,i guess this is one
334233,redacted pardon that was a kinda old thing already larping marketing meh they can get attention somehow else
334238,if you borrowed cash with aapl stock and you got a receipt from the banker did you trade your aapl stock for a piece of pvc paper did you realize a capital gain can you get your stocks back
334239,sorry but you might be right you might be wrong nobody will be able to judge and it will turn into a shitstorm get a consultant or ask frens in dms
334242,anyone here tested rango exchange was pretty surprised at how well it worked but im not technical enough to know if they made some above average compromises from a security perspective one feature that would be nice is a batch revoke button
334243,the security is attached to the productprotocolbridge being used as rango in itself is a permisionless aggregator you still have to sign each tx on each wallet depending on the route ie you take the risk of the bridgedex rango is using on each trade they have over 14b in volume with no security issuesfunds compromised so i would not worry about using the product i have done countless of tx with no issues except for a failed tx which just reverts the funds back to the chain on that step you can also cancel a tx if the process is taking too long to call the wallet txif you are bridging a very large amount i would just use the bridge service they suggest on their route directly their ido is coming up soon rumors are it could be with copper albeit rango is terra built or lbp on osmosisrango_marketing can perhaps provide more insight
334244,thank you
334245,to me the most engagingfair style of lbp is the way skyward built theirs where the units are claimable on a prorata basis at the average price of each block rather than everyone being subject to prorata of the instantaneous snapshot during the last second of the event giving no reason to join other than the last moments to retain total optionality this way you get rewarded for watching and people can choose to participate at whatever intervals of valuation they please does anyone know any other thats like this but not on near
334247,i think locke protocol is working similarly where its essentially a twap swap between two tokens
334253,is there a tool that shows aprs for uniswap lp pools
334254,revertfinance
334255,its basically a dca where the output balance tokens sold per period will always be the same but the input balance out towards buying can vary modifying the effective final price completely oracleless the one mentioned above seems to have some sort of price reference
334256,so its literally just an overtime supplydemand sale mechanism
334257,ahhh gotcha
334258,ive collected some these tools may he useful to ya
334259,appreciate it
334260,thank you
334262,how can you wrap a secret tag that only owner can see in an nft metadata are public ye so it supposes the owner gets a secret password offchain
334263,not sure about itit seems the nft in the tweet is unlisted
334264,sounds like a lot of bs
334265,thank you
334266,its something to do with your public key through metamask i guess potion did it for their nft as well only the address that mints it can reveal it
334267,yes but once its revealed its no secret anymore correct
334268,using opensea centralized server i thinkyou can set stuff there during minting
334269,its not encrypted or anything you just trust opensea to reveal it to holders in the ui
334270,then it meaning the metadata are encrypted with some kind of pgp that only opensea can decrypt pretty smart they released such service lots of usecases even though if os as a third party has access to the secret it cant be used for serious cases
334271,also doubt the argicultor went into that kind of headache lol
334273,gm everyone have important questions with regard to the pnd of lobsterdao collection pieces i want them to be worth 10 eth floor minimum so doing a live discussion on howhere
334274,
334275,oh fuck
334276,
334277,key point for me in there
334278,are working on encrypted nft content too but not decentralized yet
334279,
334280,so they only have fixed income bit now
334282,seems like it windrathio feel free to comment and educate sers
334285,timeless
334286,yeh thinking this too
334287,only explaination
334288,perp all the things
334290,not really
334291,its a matter of ethereum fees costs
334292,you could create the same market on a starkex based dex and it will have 1000x more volume as its way easier arbitrageable
334293,liquidity matters but until a certain point because if lps see it as way more profitable to lp for yt they will just start issuing them
334294,rebase all the things reduce gas cost
334295,there are a ton of layers of complexity to create a liquid yield market
334296,you can still enter leveraged variable interest positions or enter fixed rate positions everything is just reliant on one liquidity pool now instead of two
334297,heres a good point that was brought up weeks ago
334298,
334300,
334301,0xngmi and the llama crew really are incredible builders our lives are so much easier thanks to them give them gitcoin money
334303,talking about grants spare some change for a community led tcg on blockchain since 2020
334304,also check out grants maintained by lobster dao members3 and my own grant gitcoincogrants3150defiweb3developerroadmap
334305,sovs compendium was approved for a grant as well this round i was curious if anyone might be able to provide some info on how to get matching contributions setup
334306,hey sers sorry to ask again but ive been reading up on interoperability networks specifically connext and layerzero wondering if anyone has conducted any research around security i know layerzero uses chain link oracles and connext doesnt does anyone have any resources i can look into around this
334307,thats what i was able to find does it help sir
334308,thanks ser will check it out now
334309,happy to fill in whatever gaps help however i can
334311,probably a bit of a dirty word but does anyone know someone high up at hitbtc
334312,is there a collection
334313,got locked out of my account years ago when i swapped phones and didnt back up my authenticator managed to rekyc for every cex after aside from there they were being really fkn hard work just remember it again so be nice if someone here had a connection to someone who could help me regain access to it ty
334314,yes sir twittercom10b57e6da0status1502072342322847744
334316,cool replied with mine
334317,nice thanks how do i request or opt into matching funds
334318,you need to update your grant so it isnt inactive and you automagically start participating in the active matching rounds these are happening every quarter or so
334319,were writing a lot about all those bridging systems on an oracle based solution is considered less secure than something like connext or hop maybe arjunbhuptani can enlighten you specifically on this
334320,thanks a lot ser that would be appreciated
334321,
334322,their airdrop made so many people rich
334323,really or u joking
334324,its paraswap level just worse
334328,happy to help too a good overview can come from this blog post l0 is an externally verified model where you trust the oracles and a relayer for a given tx to not collude connext otoh currently is a locally verified system similar to an atomic swapwere heading towards a new still trustless security model which ill be posting a blog post about early next week tho
334330,respectfully the assumption that external validators are inherently insecure is outdated mpc networks of thousands of nodes can be run entirely in tees such that no node can access its own secret shares that security model plus the extensibility bitcoin nonevm support and generalizability generic messaging thirdparty contract layer of external validators more than solves the trilemma
334331,cc philippzentner
334332,question about balancer why are nearly all the pools just two or three tokens from reading about it the whole idea seems to be 8pools but theres only 1 active one
334333,why arent they consolidated more to concentrate liquidity
334335,it really is not outdatedthe economic security of the mpc system will always be the economic security of the mpc validator set which is fundamentally distinct from the security of the underlying chains this is the academic definition of a new trust assumption
334336,it can be an acceptable trust assumption iff the economic security of the system is greater than that of the underlying chains
334337,this will generally always be false for something like ethereum l1 tho
334338,im ramping up on solidity dev and want to tinker and build some apps i want to build in semipublic with the goal to meet some cool likeminded people while i work and ask questions anyone have recs for dev groups developer dao is the only one ive heard so far
334339,not sure how open they are to new members right now but raid guild is pretty great
334340,this is a straw man youre assuming that mpc networks can only be secured economically in a custodial mpc network that relies on the integrity of secret shares to secure funds those funds cannot be lost if secret shares cannot be compromised the primary security concern is liveness not safety
334341,thank you i put in my application
334342,it seems the biggest problem for using univ3 oracle for long tail is that univ3 isnt available on many chains while univ2 is available everywhere keydonix seems an interesting solution but you need to pass an additional argument with merkel proof in each call vpepo what other repos with good oracle modules do you recommend to check aside of mean finance
334344,what the problem with proof
334347,you have to duplicate every single function that relay on oracle and you cant simply interact with contracts without ui because you need to generate this proof
334348,have we not seen over and over again that using twap potential for exploits had no idea chainlink costs were that insane useless for small projectprotocols
334349,any suggestion for request timeout to call a contract abi now i am calling a method on polygon and it keeps responding timeoutthe rpc i use is
334350,this is public rpc endpoint and it wont work if you request for a large block range with any timeout try infuraalchemy on free tier paid plan is more reliable ofc
334352,thanks i learned something new here and also forwarded this to our research team to look deeper into the different kinds of mpc implementations
334353,hi guys do you think stargate will significantly diminish the role of bridges like multi syn etc at least for major cross chain assets and stable coins
334354,nope why would it
334355,especially the synthetic asset bridges with their anyn tokens have a certain lock in effect and the market is complex different gtms niches to focus on etc
334356,because amm and defi can integrated directly to stargate via layer zero and in their paper their value proposition is to make bridges obselete but i agree with you it can kill bridges as it can have every assets only stable coins and majors like eth wbtc etc
334357,i mean we already have plenty of bridges connected to all major dex aggregators out there on each chain they are available on top there are nomad and axelar with similar capabilities and different security concepts advantages drawbacks and target groups also wormhole has generalized data messaging capabilities
334358,philipp interesting bridge aggregator what is your view on layer zero and stargate
334359,my personal opinion is not educated enough yet im not the biggest fan of oracle based solutions and hosting one yourself as a protocol is an even worse ideawe gonna aggregate stargate like any other and assess and grade their security concept with our researchers theyll be part of our stack for sure and in general our approach then is to consult each integration partner based on their needs target group volume sizes use cases frequency about which solutions to whitelistblacklistprefer were neutral in that sense
334360,arjun_crypto13 please let us all know once youve formed an opinion one of our researchers
334361,thanks for your explaination would like to see more agruments from experts
334362,thanks for adding me here philipp
334363,surely looking into l0 and stargate
334364,oxngmi its not exactly popular but tellor is missing from
334365,couldnt find any protocols that use them as the main oracle
334366,ah that makes sense its often a backup
334367,sorry for offtrack how do we make this text effect what is it called d
334368,spoilers
334369,many thanks
334370,now deprecated too
334371,issues dont look significant and whats alternative for long tail on sidechains that dont have univ3 i would greatly appreciate the answer from solidity devs who actually used these oracles theres significant gap between perception of how oracles work and practical code experience for example how many people here know that time weight average for univ2 have to be actively maintained via keeper and might cost a fortune same for chainlink even for some cheap sidechain
334372,im curious too keydonix was the most plausible option i stumbled on but its evidently not without caveats fwiw the uni v2 maintenance thing is mentioned in their docs which refers you to keydonix
334373,hi everyone i need your opinion and advice in a subjecti want to work in crypto space i mean get a job and earning but i dont have a special skill like solidity programmer or a degree in marketing or somethingso do you think i can get a job in crypto currency i mean is there any way for somebody like me to earn money
334374,yes you can you can try with ama airdrop commod etc
334375,you can start as community manager for some project translate materials test products support users with productsor you can start learning programming and solidityi wish you good luck with learningalso im suggesting to finish such convo here since youre asking very basic questions and here we have more defi experienced audience and discussions topics thanks
334377,i have no degree start in community projects develop your skills contribute where possible professionally assisting users being proactive and helping with content and taking every opportunity to learn what you can expect to fail a lot and to do a lot of thankless shit modding and community dev is a great way to understand projects by being able to understand the project itselfeventually people take notice and you figure out what youre good at and where you need to be
334378,would you suggest learning javascript or anything first or can i go right into solidity
334379,how can i find those opportunities and im not good with programming its really hardim trying to learn but slowly
334380,first basics js you need it for front end metamask integration tests for your smart contracts deploymentafter solidityyou can use as first ever tool
334381,kk thank you i tried a little cryptozombies but was having problems understanding someof the references etc
334382,hi guys do you know if there is a site that tracks crypto assets market cap positions throuhgout years i know some sites allow you to look positions on certain date but i am looking a tool that would put those positions in a table or visual graph
334383,like blockfolio
334384,hm how can i use it to see the changes in mc positions i can only see current mc positions
334385,i am trying to formulate a view on longer market cycles and crypto asset market cap longevity i need to see mc position for top 100 tokens from 2015 at least
334386,check this
334387,thanks alex but i was already familiar with this i can of course use cmc but i need to manually check each month i was hoping for a tool that would visually show how mc positions have changed through the years
334388,no worries i take a huge cup of coffee and start having fun with google sheets
334389,should be pretty simple to do with their ohlcv api will be surprised if it didnt already have an google sheets integration
334390,might be suitable for your use case
334391,any app regarding info about upcoming testnets
334392,do kwon was mentioning thorchain in a twitter spaces last night and now i see that on monday a native luna eth swap pool goes live on thorswap wonder if there is any correlation
334393,he said thorchain must be battle tested first before using it for terras btc reserves which i guess means they will add liq to luna and ust pools but not to btc correct me if a i am wrong pls
334394,
334395,cool thread pony la epolonye wtf his handle is posts interesting scalability stuff
334397,metis is the most expensive eth l2 right now isnt it
334398,can see some here also
334399,any reason why metis is intentionally omitted or was it an accident
334400,stunning profile pic of a supermassive blackhole banner with thomas the train and he follows optimism on his medium u guys seeing what im seeing
334401,this l2 is preneding to be l2 but basically its a fork of oe with its own token
334402,check his other many posts optimism was here pretty early so was zksync and some others a fork of a fork with vitaliks mom as marketing maybe aint the devs favorite wdyt huh
334403,idk the real deal just suggesting
334404,is there anything wrong with this isnt ethereum a fork
334405,you asked for a conspiracy theory we replied with ours idk nothing to continue on here fin
334406,whats the best way to send text based message to say 1000 addresses on eth and whats the cheapest way to do so
334407,appreciate the discussion regardless
334408,no criticism you maybe rightfully pointed out so now is a complete picture all good
334409,use comments section on etherscan
334411,what does oe stand for
334412,optimistic ethereum
334413,metis did make 2 things different from the technical point of view and i believe those played great role at its adoption apart from token adding extra attention ofcthey ve added multiple sequencers optimism only has oneand they made development permissionless on launch
334414,these dont look like significant improvements
334415,if its a one message for all maybe send them erc1155 token
334416,text can be changed dynamically if needed
334417,any app that automates this for 1000 addresses if its the same message like the mail merge of ethereum
334418,disqus might show you captchas if you make 1000 comments in one go
334419,yes main issue with 1000 messages for accounts is spammingif you can do that over9000 spammers will do that tooany evm chain has same eth address space so you can use cheapest for that
334420,ftm has pretty cheap tx according to this stat
334421,which platform is so potential to give airdrop to users
334422,
334423,hi is it possible to revoke approvals for eth on revokecash i only see options for weth
334424,there is no need for that
334425,you cant approve afaik eth hence weth is used eth is not an erc20 token
334426,interesting thanks
334427,pretty sure eth isnt a fork
334428,some folks over ethereum classic disagree
334430,by users you mean people calling their oracles is there something to read about this
334433,they have a point
334437,guys i can program basic level pyteal sc algorand and basic solidity i have an idea to implement single sided liquidity provision that i would like to discuss and eventualy deploywhere could i find like minded people to group up with i am a student so no salary or stuff like that
334438,a lot of scattered discussion is on twitter if its amm related you can always tag one of the amm big brains like dan robinson
334439,interesting feel free to pm to talk about it
334440,idk if cmc is the best source of any information id choose coingecko over cmc any day
334441,hi i am building a dapp on ethereum was confused on which tool to integrate for debugging tenderly hardhat truffle suite others etc any pointers on differences among them
334442,hi please check out this compilation there are 3 latest researches with a review on mentioned tools
334443,also any fellow developers here with whom i can have a brief chat regarding the same
334444,does anyone know of a defi protocol checklist something to look at before apeing in technical and economic points
334445,is a good place to start for tokenomics https defisafetycom is a good place to start for development process quality
334447,thanks this looks great
334448,maybe a stupid question but us there a tornado cash for stable coins
334449,tornado supports a number of stables already
334450,oh wow really i didnt found that option
334452,hero
334453,any devs or nft creator got access to coinbase upcoming nft marketplace would love to try anyone has some secret sauce
334454,are there are any best practices when using tornado cash
334455,last time i checked the liquidity for stablecoins was really low tho
334456,be very patient for best results
334457,
334458,anybody know if this guys math is right
334459,is this basically capture the flag for defi
334460,wdym capture the flag
334461,i think he means that this project is like hackerone but for defi
334462,immunefi
334463,afaik imunnefi not the dao and bounty has been paid by human decision and behavior
334464,any idea whos behind it feels like a nour haridy kinda deal given to the choice of dola devs fed up with their userbase good idea lets see how it plays out
334466,another weekend recap
334467,happy to answer any questions
334468,behind
334469,no qs just respect for implementing this like i say super excited to see if it blows up or just blows up in your face its a great response to an endless discussion so big kudos for actually doing something to try and fix the devs do something problem
334470,talk is very cheap
334471,could anyone suggest to me any good solution for multi signature custody please is copper good or fire blocks something else
334472,gnosis
334473,ty ser i appreciate the support
334474,im thinking about it too
334475,its the gold standard afaik
334476,and if add one more feature compatibility with ledgertrezor if it possible at all
334479,has any project done an airdrop where the tokens are available only to provide as liquidity so if you are eligible for 10 tokens the only way to get it is to provide the other side of the pair ie eth
334480,o3swap
334482,ty will look at github
334483,that sounds clever did you think of this idea
334484,dunno its close to an ohm bond in function
334485,gn lobs ive made this collection so you can use it as your handbook youll find in it a huge number of proven solidity cheatsheets tools articles resources tools and an awesome bonus3telegraphsoliditycheatsheetspack0320
334486,anyone look into these
334487,
334488,anyone using fwb discord is it worth spending 4k usd
334489,not a ponzi at all
334490,disappointing was looking forward to a good ponzi
334491,5 fwb is enough for a local membership
334492,it depends are you real into nfts and are us based or in a major city
334493,i dont regret joining one bit totally worth it i heard about some alpha thru there thats been pretty lucrative but you get out what you put into it
334495,
334496,are they under collective hallucination seems quite an attractive short
334497,
334498,
334499,
334500,
334501,their ability to attract huge tvl over several days is impressive
334502,but the bridging fee is not cheap at all though not seeing myself abondoning anyswap anytime soon
334503,yeah im not sure about their future plans to compete on fees but the big draw is security ie the recent wormhole exploit on sol
334504,coinbase has a waitlist might be easiest to sign up for that
334505,
334506,very interesting stuff
334507,is that a curve dao issue though to me it seems like there is just no one to bid higher so voters accept whats given and because the liquidity is rented bribers dont feel like 11 paying makes much economic sense it should be at a discount hence all gud
334508,
334509,a monday of interesting stuff huh would actually fully agree here and might be totally wrong though well see if ui for normies is the ultimate cashcow holds here it does for cexes arguably a much biggerbetter product opensea but not for crypto wallets afaik
334510,that makes sense might also be that bribers dont know how much theyre giving away they just see ill get x tokens when checking bribe page idk though just smells like somethings off that i dont notice
334511,wonder what the more sustainable option is for curve dao so they can still maintain their lead while also using some of that budget for more experiments like that new fundraising gauge
334514,question is when crv emission eventually will be going down to zero by then they hope the lp fee alone can incentivize liquidity like uniswap there is no bribe anymore
334515,300 years
334516,i dont think so aint the curve maxi touted the reducing emission is bullish for crv
334517,the long tail becomes irrelevant sooner than 100 years but the emissions go on for that long
334518,like in bitcoin sizeable rewards end soon enough even if price x10
334519,i see didnt know that curve will have emission for that long then the idea is crv should be so valuable that even little emission is enough to incentivize liquidity
334520,they will have to make a change it wont be able to survive without a bit of inflation
334521,a veeeery old convo i have not seen any replies to yet if u have good articles some maxi a bit of eric weis or whatever his name was maybe some coincenter people can be gud
334523,blz dont outright ask if u should get into a paid group here lol redacted
334524,the issue if thats even an issue is that the value of crv printed over a year is much higher than yearly admin fees that curve is generating otherwise bribing would make very little sense it wont be possible to gain xy by giving away x in bribesalso bribing makes these easy to get crv rewards a bit more expensive thus making overspending less of an issue
334525,
334526,very important article touching on critical matters relevant to the future of our economy
334527,philippzentner sorry to hear this somehow i observed that bridges hacking incendents are more frequent than other defi off my mind wormhole thor synapse anyswap poly network etc got exploited before
334528,huh just gave me an idea of something i can do for
334529,so looking at poster it uses events to emit logs as messages and then use a centralized layer thegraph to store index and present them
334530,
334531,i am sorry but how does this remotely make any sense nourharidy
334532,unless was just shitposting just a bunch of hot takes where apples to oranges are compared idk unless i am missing something comparing a huge stablecoin w that of no capitalization is like saying you need less ops cost than tesla as a company
334533,
334534,question didnt one get rekt pretty hard if threw in a few weeks back because the strike was hit and it was surely over 10 immed loss or no blz help w stats juliankoh ser anons might have fudded me again
334536,
334537,or do this strat
334538,is there a bit more on 3 wanna learn
334539,frankly playing with options is not risk free
334540,youre just betting against volatility
334541,i think in most cases better to just lp which a similar bet against volatility
334542,thats likely a no for sure since your fees barely offset even a slight move here at least the yield quoted is higher no
334543,idk i am no dhr robinsono
334545,isnt it essentially timediscrete arbitragethe pic shows calendar arbitrage where youre profiting on theta curve diffs but just showing the concepteg you sell a put 3000 eth strike you buy another one 3000 becoming more neutral or neutral earning staking rewards on the sidethe main thing is not getting neuteredcorrect me as i may be wrong
334546,i have been in yusdceth put selling for 2 epoches since the lm round 2 started pocketed 2 rounds of profit with lm but yes if eth rekt you will lose money cash secured put is somewhat bullish strategy that betting eth wont get rekt too much within a week
334547,however if eth slowly trending down never drop too much ie 15 within a week you still profit from it nicely
334548,can we do this invest equal amount of eth cc and csp in a way this is called short straddle shorting volatility works well in crab market
334549,but it is a bet that market is crabbing if pump or rekt will not fare that well
334550,never risk free you use option to express your view either bullish bearish or crabby
334551,
334552,
334553,how is it apples to oranges theyre all 1 stablecoins the point im making is exactly that having a lot of liquidity does not make a huge stablecoin organic demand and velocity of exchange do we currently have many times more volumes for dola on fantom than many huge liquidity stables all going through a tiny 800k of liquidity having 100m liquidity is wasteful and does not help a stablecoin if no one is even trading or using the stablecoin
334554,easy to brrr money and increase capitalization using liq incentives doesnt mean anyone is even using the stablecoin
334555,good discussion tho thx curious to hear others
334556,well be long the asset from cc you mean that being a short straddlestrangle depending on the strikes ofc how soi was positive rbn is just offsetting being the bbookstyle other side selling the short say put to the users to mms and now to anyone in the open aucs
334557,i agree that there is no need for so many types of stable coins where the only purpose is to farm yield not stable store of value like usdcusdt
334558,you are right but the dola pool with 800k liq is not usable for larger trader different use cases i would argue
334559,yes in cc you supply eth of cos you long it but your view is crabby market so cc csp win both side
334560,definitely larger liq helps there not saying its completely useless
334561,that being said many small trades larger volumes higher trade fees apy more liq the dola pool has been slowly growing liq this way recently this used to be how it worked before curve skewed the incentives using vecrv
334562,is polygon being weird or is it just me
334563,yah got your logic now thxeg separating the virtual portfolios in the mindi was just trying to find out if thats the case with the strat mentioned in the twi post reluctant of that
334564,some confused a crab market strategy is risk free it is not both have no downside protection
334565,definitely not riskfree agreed i was just trying to express that being in a csp pool and then buying the auctioned contract is 1 p 1 p 0 rather than 1 p 1 c 0 in my mind but i may be mistaken and would love to be fixed if thats the case
334566,you mean csp call option thats a very bullish strategy
334567,meant this
334568,i dont exactly understand what vault he stake cc or csp and what auction what is it he bought do you understand
334569,its simply wrong no matter the legal arguments and enriches teamfoundersvcs at retail investor expensebut like he said the market bought into it retail isnt the victim
334570,yes sir i barely have highschool diploma and been fulltime crypto for about a year and a half making 7 times average wage in my country
334571,god bless web3
334572,any non web3 skill can be transposed into web3 literally everything is neededcoderswritersmarketersmanagersvloggerscontentcreatorsprogrammersdevelopersanything really
334573,everyone just wants to be a vlogger trader tho i dont understand why lel
334574,condition by web2
334575,congrats bro
334576,thanks legend
334577,theres so much demand for workforce in web3 that there even is a course to get you prepared for a job
334578,
334579,here are several cool links related to job topic
334580,worklife balance is the biggest thing to overcome moving to web3
334581,what life
334582,precisely
334583,wonder how many founders are burnt out from the 247 grind
334584,100 its hard to get there
334585,not much different from web2 founding though
334586,
334587,a friend of mine is building this i think he is spot on mental health is black spot in crypto
334588,every burn make you a greater founderindividualfor me discipline helps a lot timeboxed exposition to toxic envs like ct sometime
334590,most important thing i find is to socialise with normies outside web3 they keep me grounded can get stuck in the endless crypto cycle otherwise i try and fail to not check telegram outside work and i also avoid thinking about crypto on weekends its damn hard to segment my life
334591,how do you avoid thinking about something i wish i could pull a severance on me and forget crypto is a thing for half of every day
334592,talk therapy helps takes time but plug away at it
334593,this sounds very cliche but a few no tech vacation days where you forbid yourself from taking your phone computer etc helps a huge dealits like a drug withdrawal those first few hours are terrible and at some point it becomes awesome
334594,most good defi protocols optimise dopamine loop so i think the analogy is perfect it is withdrawral important to get balance
334595,also i have huge troubles sleeping and found that shutting off work at 11pm at most makes te
334596,makes the biggest difference
334597,physical activity especially outside in nature works for me you need to take yourself outside of the environment that you are in while you grind crypto
334598,yeah i work out 6 times a week and do yoga on day 7 i find i struggle to sleep as well without it i listen to unrelated podcasts to help broaden my view of whats up cycling everywhere helps too fuck public transit just provides an opportunity for endless scrolling through your phone
334599,i get blind drunk six days a week and take opiates on day seven
334600,definitely a way to do it
334601,is there any telegram group to meet crypto people irl eg im rn in puerto escondido mexico and would love to know who else is here and might want to grab a coffeebeer could be another lobstergroup
334602,can u blz organize a lobster event in amsterdam i am too lazy and swamped w work
334603,best not do this in interest of personal safety
334604,blz
334605,okay fine i will do it if you give me your private keys so i can safe keep it from any irl wrench attack
334606,so lobsters dubai is not happening
334607,idk sir i live in metaverse
334608,dubai is extremely safe imho the risks of a meetup their are v low
334609,we will find out how safe it is at the inaugural lobster dubai meet up
334610,philipp is doxxed af nw
334611,everyone meet at burj khalifa blz bring private keys to reserve vip entry
334612,we are lobsters we can gather on the beach
334613,but ser i only have mnemonic this ok
334614,agree for sure you have to take all the risks in such a case
334615,check out mexcryptos theyre cdmx based but will be one connection away from people in other areas in mexico
334616,githubcomjloppphysicalbitcoinattacksblobmasterreadmemd read it to know more about physical attacks also check out as an examle of rare attack armadillophonecombloghowtodetectimsicatchersin general just do not ever take your device with crypto to meetups do not speak too much use multisig inform at least 1 trusted person of where are you going and with whom always take a picture and send it to a reliable person with the license plate number of the car you are getting into agree on a time to get in touch and what to do in case of a bad situation
334617,max security strats is lose key so no matter how much they torture your family you cant reveal
334618,id be down for this as long as it fits around the 20 million events i already have
334619,amsterdam is looking too packed tbh
334620,hey does anyone knows how to sync gethnode in archive mode on eth chain in the right way
334621,nan
334622,i mean its syncing much slower besides other chains
334623,much more
334624,its a command line flag no
334625,ty
334626,geth in archive mode is slow to sync could be just that
334627,can u invite me to the best ones blz i only plan to eat and drink
334628,and sit at the booth lol
334629,
334630,nan
334631,my run scripthomegethgeth cache25048 http httpaddr0000 httpport8886 ws wsaddr0000 wsport8885 httpvhostsethjsonrpcmchangecom datadir homegethethereum mainnet syncmode full gcmode archive cachetrie 30 cachegc 0 cachesnapshot 20 ipcpath homegethgethipc
334632,me after 5 min of sitting at the eth global booth
334633,its excruciating ive synced an erigon one before and its orders of magnitude quicker
334634,its actually one of the reasons i moved to alchemycom as soon as they gave us early access back then resyncing our node would take days
334635,not trying to promote sorry for the link
334636,nah is good
334637,its a multibillion dollar thing not a shill lol
334638,alchemy is nice but network io is bottleneck
334639,yep but back then it was the first service with trace_call enabled which we needed
334640,literally the only reason we used them they actually enabled because i asked for it
334641,guess its more of a framework eg 1 use vault x2 stake the tokens3 buy the corresponding options to offset the position ie the vault mints callput options for the depositors the depositors are in the position the depositors can then basically buy those same options backso you can deposit in a yvusdc put selling vault and then buy the put option say here
334642,your curated links skills and memory are something out of this world
334643,thank you ive always loved working with huge amounts of data its something ive got used to since i worked in a bank security thats why my tg nickname is a farm42 this is the name of banktobank messaging system app used by bank officers sometimes i even dream that im reading a research and wake up
334644,
334645,how you organise your daytoday readingresearchinfo sir
334646,i gave roam a go and really liked using it in an infodumpbacklinkresearch journal kind of way but not having easy mobile access was a total pain considering a move over to obsidian
334647,i feel you hahaonly i was more into biochemimmunity stuff and more of a okaay lets write that oh i remember a nice source where it was mentioned no system which isnt good c
334648,i was a frustrated roam user and now very happy with obsidian highly recommend that move
334649,just install a few plugins so it feels like roam daily notes etc
334650,muditg congrats
334651,telegram helps me organize my work saved messages folders timer messages twink accounts notion and of course a huge number of text or paper notes that i write and save all the time it is important to always have a few hours in the evening to plan for tomorrow and to structure and remember everything from the previous day without this i cant really shelve the information
334652,do you use bidirectional linking in notion or are just good at structuringfoldering the infoim finding it a bit slow however my laptop is not that speedy for working with a lot of text however for a reading list it seems better than pocket
334653,yes sir also using such tools are called mindmapping services experience in osint is a good help in it no doubt here are several tutorials on it tmelobsters_chat298724
334654,as an example not mine but illustrates it or
334655,do you know a way for 1020 people to contribute bookmarks into a single place
334657,i personally use todoist for all the daytoday notes and organization and a custom repo for a more permanent knowledge base theres also obsidian which does the same thing but with a real ui
334658,hey does anyone know where i can find any numbers on estimated amount lost due to seed phrase phising in 202021
334659,startme has a team workspace functionality
334660,thanks already did months ago no progress
334661,ciphertracecom crystalblockchaincom chainalysiscom checkpointcom prob have posted their researches try checking on their websites
334662,fwiw i just talked to recommendation from lobs discord he agrees with you me that it is not a taxable event and the burden of proof is on the irs during the audit to prove otherwisemore or less the irs takes an aggressive stance with every rule even if grey and no logic to do so
334663,
334664,thank you
334665,we launched a new group in the degenscore cafe for apecoin sellers buyers and claimoors jump in there if you have traded apecoin on uni v3 or claimed with your nft and want to talk about the future of the project ivangbi plz ban me if i am upsetting you
334666,while your list contains some valid examples of bridge exploits synapse does not belong there we did have a problem with a third party metapool which was being used as the liquidity source for synapsebridge the issue was due to the incorrect metapool implementation while the core synapse contracts were unaffected in terms of exploit
334667,great video on topic not crypto but i assume it will be useful in web3
334668,did the lifi hack only happen on mainnet why i was using lifi all over the place polygon fantom the rollups etc etc
334669,funny how polygon and fantom are effectively testnets for ivan
334670,gmwe are searching for the bank for our swiss cryptoasset management a lot of banks declined us since we are crypto maybe you know some banks anywhere in the world which we could try to onboard at least with 5 chancesty
334671,try silvergate
334672,sygnum i think they have a partnership with aave if im not wrong
334673,yea they are based in that side too speak to bitcoinsuisse as well maybe
334674,swissquote v good servicealthough they have banking services they operate more like a trading desk
334675,seems so ser
334677,sers any alternative public rpc for avax cchain
334678,pokt team to the rescue
334679,tnx ser
334687,why ust 085 and what does it mean
334688,i wouldnt trust it either just means that they have a certain of trust peg wont hold when needed id guess
334689,or that it will be redeemable for
334690,has anyone done in depth comparison of ust mim dola frax etc btw
334691,hope this is not old yet
334692,came to share the same ouch
334693,i still dont get what lobsterdao is about anyone has a good starter link
334694,ser the info is in github overview link in pinned if that doesnt help maybe you arent reading properly idk tldr a research chat basically
334697,guys honest question and i would really appreciate some guidanceinsight from anyone who could contributeim nearing 30y and ive been a bankingfinance lawyer for the past 6y ive had enough and want to turn 180 nothing to do with law anymore my main interest for the past 2y has been crypto i would really like to work in this ecosystem for a livingsince i have 0 tech programming etc and low financial skills some courses in my law and management master and relative experience from my law practice how and where could i start i would be down to relocatework remotely etc that wouldnt be an issuefor us plebs without tech skills feels like its unreachabletks for your anyone time
334698,udacity programing courses if you want to get started on the developer side of things
334699,noted tks
334700,lots of daos need guidance on structuring and the like if i were you thats where id start vs picking up whole new skill check lexnodes work on twitter
334701,yes if you really hate law fair enough but were going to need a lot of crypto lawyers lawmakers at some point soon maybe take some time off first but dont throw your expertise away
334702,combine both and spearhead straight into become a topnotch deficryptoweb30 lawyer specialize in frameworksthat will be in high demand for a long time
334703,which jurisdiction did you practice in
334704,start from grants and daos also yes web30 lawyer is a soughtafter specialty you should definitely try also check out mirrorxyz0x954888b7a5c6736f4955df18b556d8328fd02f615k9llack4tzu5whl68cm3bbsmslel_xxj2krgynwp7a twittercomlex_dao tmelobsterdao36969
334705,just wondering where do u find resources for crypto lawyer
334706,is business strategy is high demand or relevant for daos
334708,
334709,seems confirmed by the man himself
334710,metaverse is a land of savages
334713,can someone clarify to me whether unified liquidity mentioned by stargate is just a buzzword or it means exactly what it states
334714,should mean tokens wa xa ya from chains w x y token a on chain z depending on the context or token a on chain z token a on chain w x ywhich one depends on implementation i guess
334715,
334716,these ldo are still under hacker control
334717,can also mean both again depends on implementation
334718,thats a totally different address
334719,that makes sense i understand how thats a big deal for tokens that only have synthetics on certain chains like eth on solanaterra but how is that groundbreaking compared to when youre bridging usdc from chain a to chain b where usdc on destination chain is not a synthetic issued by a bridge
334720,nan
334721,no address will transfer money to a hacker address for no reason
334722,well it is a synthetic issued by a bridge unless its issued by circle on that chain or supplied by lps in exchange for synthetic asset on counter party chain
334723,unless it is controlled
334724,maybe the hacker owns those ldos unless i am not following you not sure
334725,dont think so unless the attacker was part of the private round
334726,wait i am lost so are you saying not just 1 wallet got compromised sorry i am saying nonsense
334727,please tldr what your point is
334728,apparently 2 wallets have been compromised
334729,
334730,well its that or the hackers address
334731,oh fuck i see
334732,or 3rd party that got hacked
334733,note the phrase fairly sophisticated opsec is opsec fairly in this case can be a big issue
334734,also being a sophisticated defi user doesnt equate to being sophisticated with your opsec
334737,this
334738,
334739,rip
334741,nan
334743,damn _googlecom
334744,
334745,thoughts on l12 token bear case
334746,
334747,they are comparing l1 tokens to telecom stocks both do have cash flows but not sure if both can be seen from the same lens
334748,well the real reason is bad keyseed management but lets pretend its the phishermen
334749,thats the gist a subgraph can be decentralized but someone to still put some api keys and pay for queries for now its been sponsored by the graph foundation and a few people are building on top of it
334750,theres no i in lobs
334751,what are the best farm projects in arbitrum with decent yield for stablebtceth
334752,glp on gmx yearn on arbit
334753,delet
334754,stargate for stables
334755,still need to go through this code
334756,is the code open source audited
334757,contracts are up on their docs
334758,cant find a link to their github
334759,audited by someone rather new from memory
334760,the swap method is fairly novel
334762,i havnt dug into the code myself yet but tying up a bridge with a swaps mechanic probably deserves more
334763,sers whats the best multichaindeloy boilerplate you know i really like how does is structured but im not fully understand how did they organized these nice jsons in each folder
334764,hi friends id like to study about web 30 could you introduce a thread or an article please
334765,
334766,under layerzero labs if anyone is interested
334767,
334768,market cap like 182mm undervalued or overvalued with the tech
334769,ill craft up a few crosschain vaults and see how they perform with it
334770,have a few ideas i need to test out but havnt had the time
334771,i think 1bn tvl is a lot to have deployed in like 5 days in rather uncharted territory
334772,check out aave they used to have some multi chain stuff in their repo about a year ago
334773,sushiswap repo is another good example
334774,this uses hardhatdeploy to generate the deployments folder per chain maps to networks in hardhat config
334775,what are some interesting mechanisms to avoid frontrunners so far ive found integral delayed swap with timeaveraged prices launching today cowswap offchain batch auction with onchain settlement
334776,portugaleu mainly and some african countries
334777,thank you all for your messages
334778,its as aureliusbtc said they are switching the chainid in their deployment scripts
334779,
334780,sustainability
334781,our number 1 priority here in degen land
334782,fxs
334783,hi sers do we have someone from coingecko in the chat
334784,yes jin_cg and bobby others y
334786,hola how can we assist
334787,ohh yes yes i wasnt expecting that fast answer haha
334788,coingecko is responsive dm me the details
334789,
334790,hey lobsters im having a hard time remembering a specific crypto startup with this logo will delete if its against the rules
334796,thank you so much
334798,guys can anyone help me with choosing course or book about ethereum and web3 development
334799,have you checked cia roadmap
334800,
334801,thank you nope
334802,will check it now
334804,
334805,wonder if its tax season
334806,only ever hear about hacks when its time to realise them losses
334807,didnt arthurs fund get flagged recently on something
334808,hacks do not neccessarily count as claimable losses for tax purposes in the us they do not for example and even if you ignore that its still a dumb idea
334809,uk the same
334810,would be subject to a negligible value claim under uk tax law if there is no prospect of recovery due to theft
334811,what about losing your keys
334812,but ill not speculate further as im not a tax professional and dont want to suffer the wrath of ser ivan
334813,yeah we are kind of asking for that now
334814,difficult burden of proof that youre not just playing games to get out of paying ie brain wallet or paper recovery just being stashed somewhere and denying you have access
334815,suppose could argue the same in this instance can you prove you dont control hacker wallet
334816,so yeah stopping here
334817,ser 120 lobs r lost just let it goooooooo
334818,is there any stablecoin pegged to chinese yuan
334819,i think terra might have some
334820,why dont people just have two computers one for their defi stuff with a hardware wallet and one for their other stuff
334821,because its an unholy pain to pull out a whole computer to sign on snapshot any time theres a proposal id reckon
334822,i think yes on jarvis
334823,doing defi with a hw wallet can be hard too if you have a lot of positions or need to be able to make fast moves i would think the better two computer setup would be the old hot wallet with x amount of fluid assets then everything that doesnt need to be moved with any urgency on the other
334824,i have 6
334825,dont trust extensions
334827,yeah thats i mean one for stuff youre not touching and then the other for your hot wallet
334828,pretty sure losing it all to hack would be harder
334829,just ux i feel the dilemma is always ease of use v security
334830,see here ser hmrc does not consider theft to be a disposal as the individual still owns the stolen asset and has a right to recover it this means victims of theft cannot claim a loss for capital gains taxand here this means that misplacing the key does not count as a disposal for capital gains tax purposes if it can be shown there is no prospect of recovering the private key or accessing the tokens a negligible value claim could be made if hmrc accepts the negligible value claim the individual will be treated as having disposed of and reacquiring the tokens they cannot access so that they can crystallise a loss
334836,lets circle back to the hack itself do we have more technical details other than a bad link andor loaded docx
334837,is this a case of using mac or linux for your trading machine fixes this for example
334838,because it was a windows specific exploit
334839,thats something we can all learn from
334841,there is much bigger worldcryptoworld than uk us with all respect to them no discrimination of those
334842,hi guys is there any write up on stargate stg tokenomics the 1b fdv mc seems steep tried to search twitter threads for more info with no avail
334843,
334844,thanks i skimmed through the gitbook but shouldve looked deeper
334845,by default it is on developer docs but you need to select user docs i had the same problems
334846,any idea how they manage the twap with only printing the trade at the end of the time
334847,
334848,pretty yuge i love ribbon guys their code is cheffs ckiss
334849,why not just use flashbot protect
334850,pm i was in the same situation
334851,had a dream ivan banned me from this telegram last night
334852,ivangbi plz no ban
334853,do you dream as a couch
334854,
334855,hes in singapore so no cgt
334856,same am interested to know i cant see how a mobile wallet and a pc wallet were both compromised best guess is electronically stored seeds keyloggers would get the pc one not the mobile one
334857,there is no general case do x to be secure but the main lesson here is probably dont defaulttrust any messages you ever get from anyone ever
334858,thanks i didnt know about thatim researching ideas involving defi mechanics for nondefi use cases for those frontrunning doesnt just allow mev but can break the system completely hence my interest in specific antisniping patterns and im just a newbie degen myself
334859,im still reading the paper the order goes into a delay contract with a preapproved swap amount and prepaid gas the idea is theres no point sniping since the snipes are also delayed but have no info asymmetry advantage
334860,holla
334861,another project going to switch to vetokenomic thats really interesting that ve token model becoming defacto standard for governance tokens
334863,its worked really well for the ftm fork of balancer beethovenx which i imagine helped spur the decision
334864,there is flash arbitrage built by acy finance you can read about it in their wp
334865,
334866,new fud from monet
334867,cant help but feel like this is just waaaa because mkr lost momentum
334868,luna is here to stay i think regardless of our posturing
334869,famous last words
334870,wassa wassa wassa wassa
334872,
334873,lmao ftx bought stargate finance tokens
334874,the 2 transactions thing or when
334875,3 tx not 2 ser
334876,ye
334877,ah my favourite day of the week
334878,we bought the auction so pls pump it is what i read
334879,is it weird that its impossible to find any details about the round besides the amount in millions raisedno valuation no idea if tokens attached etc
334880,12 month locked ser and sam said they wont sell in 3 years
334881,its most time like this
334882,there should probably be a blog post thats got more details
334883,still creepyfirst off we did indeed buy all the tokens we love the team and what theyre doing and we believe this space and the technology theyre building is really importantsuper creepy
334884,is there defi on etc
334885,atleast its not a seed sale but you can call it auction
334887,
334888,ser but idk
334889,wut ser
334890,is this like consensys but in a dao form more documentation please
334891,anybody else having issues with metamask on firefox
334892,have been having issues with metamask on chrome already and now firefox
334893,u r polygon ser not izirium so youd be directly giving grants as polygon for people to build on eth main chain i am not buying that sorry idk
334894,if you wanted to do something as we are l2 who helps ethereum ecosystem as a whole suggest looking into optimism public goods funding strategy i bet you know it or just literally make a grant allocation to all core devs who are underpaid nothing special required
334895,sorry but it reads like marketing buzz
334896,unless i missed something
334897,
334898,telos they tout antifrontrunning
334899,same with brace always have to click the icon and reload page every time a new tab or window is opened
334900,saw this message bouncing in my main tg about google docs as security threat as far as i am concerned the only safe way to open unknown docs is through your anon gdrive account where you dont keep anything is there any merit to this claim
334901,heres the full write up about that i havent read it yet just saw it being shared on a couple of securityminder channels
334902,lobsters being the best as always
334903,it definitely helps to open it in your browser via google docs thats already a much more securesandboxed environment than your operating system directly
334904,proceeds to run tails each time i move stuff
334905,overall you just want to remove outside files as far as possible from the device youre using to sign transactions with has been discussed here plenty of times theres several levels of solutions depending on your paranoia
334906,ompiled everything into a single note telegrapharthurhackedresearch0322
334907,i mean anonymousplanetorg did a pretty good job enhancing paranoia for me but at the end of the day practicality did its job so i just run mullvad and have a pihole
334908,thanks
334909,if any of you have your usdc invested in maple you probably want to take it out as they are allowing some insane stuff to happen
334910,please tell me more
334911,i wrote a short thing about it 2 weeks ago you can check here next part will be likely posted today as i think i am onto something way worse
334912,has not much to do with being a lender there your comment makes the assumption that its not safe
334913,its similar how borrowers of comp are farming that native token
334914,ethically maybe stupid but as a simple farmer cant care to much
334915,it is quite difference conceptually as compound has no farmer whitelist controlled by compound
334918,my point is that mpls price should be likely lower after you learn that big part of their income comes from someone borrowing usdc to put it back into the pool
334919,why
334920,nan
334921,i assume that both fbg and mngr are dumping their farmed tokens so the price should be lower based on what happened and what you described
334922,well i think i will be able to explain more i will try to put all the info together today and you can decide for yourself then just wanted to give yall a headsup
334923,apyvision
334924,how could i take the snapshot on the project im gonna do reimbursement on exploited contract but not sure how to take it without using subgraph
334925,what type of working style is ideal for defi or i guess crypto web3 etc in general does anyone find themselves to be more nomadic going from project to project especially during the start up phase and leaving before the day to daydaily routine phase kicks in or do they push through in order to define themselves a clear role and stick around for the daily routine
334926,this question doesnt really make sense you can have a defined role in startup from day 1 nomadism refers to geographic location not positions in an industry for me its just i like a project i contribute to it on discord or we then apply for a job with them for a few months or a yr and see how i feel i think its still too soon to identify any meaningful labor patterns yet
334927,i think you read a bit too much into the nomad thing i was describing it as more wandering from project to project
334928,i dont think theres a right answer i see both cases just as frequent as the other tbh maybe a little more of the nomadism as you described it but often because of how short lived projects are as well so that may skew it a bit
334929,nan
334930,i was wondering if anyone saw any writeups on daos with vetoken models from a legal point of view
334931,yeah i hate my country dont know why he called me a patriot too
334932,lol outstanding scam
334933,yeah i am actually thinking that he decreased his chances by using that word
334934,i bet he is in this group and sees how we laugh at his attempt
334935,always effective
334936,did you buy xlm
334938,that shit was pointed out a super long time ago as it wasnt against rules obviously the loaners took advantage of it but there was an agreement to never allow them to do it again
334939,maybe join the damn maple chat and look it up before writing a medium article what the shit lol
334941,careful sometimes they report you and your account gets locked
334942,appreciate that you comment something you apparently know little about
334946,the screenshot you attached is on 11th march and its an answer to mine article you can even see my name there idk man
334947,and thats not even relevant here
334949,you clearly have an agenda here dude your article was at best basically a correction of one of the conclusions in oxc4ts article the incorrect conclusion was pointed out by maple on discord and twitter on 29th jan a whole month and a half prior to your articlesee below screenshot from discord
334950,nan
334951,sid also responded to your remarks on the matter when you were requesting commentary after publishing your not groundbreaking article as seen below
334952,nan
334953,and there is more to the story
334954,thats why i wrote about it here today but i guess you will have to wait a bit to understand
334955,
334956,now you are insinuating here and in the discord that there is something else going on writing in their discord asking where you can borrow mpl either implying that you want to short prior to the impact of your impending great journalistic work s or that it has something to do with a contract bug or both either way your questions and the way you conduct yourself around them clearly indicate a maliciousness its very transparent
334957,nan
334958,anyway that is it from me
334959,ok you got it
334960,because contacting the core team about problems they dont know about is apparently malicious
334961,based on screenshots youre doing everything but trying to contact the team directly lmao oh my god guise im acting in good faith now how do i short this token while i pretend to have earth shattering news
334962,just like we dont let anons come in here and post shill links we shouldnt let anons come in and post fud links eitherif people want to put their real name and reputation behind something then thats different
334963,anon or not if you are making a big accusation back it up with facts otherwise probably better to keep quiet if its related to a legitimate security issue and you have good intentionsacting in good faith deal with it in private with the team
334969,that issue was discussed maple case extensively before its not even fud its just facts but thats why bringing it up again is kinda moot because its doubleposting for that matter only fin because there was nothing new everybody knows it
334970,
334971,interesting lido vesting contracts allow for some tweaking it seems arthur hack case
334973,look at the tradfi equivalent loyalty shares
334980,you can do it via interaction with an archive rpc node and some indexer like covalentmoralis both have free plans to try it out be wary of rate limiting though alternatively you can use scan api as an indexerfirst you need to compile a list of addresses for reimbursement this is most likely all addresses ever interacted with some contract a this is done via indexer just look up transaction history for a and filter out needed interactionlastly you need some metric for reimbursement this might be token balance on a given blockheight or values of some view function of your contract asomeusermetric this is where archive node comes in iterate through a list of addresses and ask the node what was the view function value at needed block heightdont forget to log all that so you dont have to start from scratch in case of bugtimeoutetc
334981,
334982,looks like they are decided to join crypto instead of previous threats
334983,shots fired
334984,mattygoal sorry for removing ur post was an accident
334985,no worries
334986,fyi cleared cache and reinstalled works fine again had to setup all accounts again tho
334987,hey fam were researching the lping strategies and posted some of our results in the article would love to discuss with the community
334988,
334989,nan
334990,leveraging uni v3 positions is brilliant idea earning more fees while price is flat and protecting from il if price crashing or mooning sounds fantastic do y have any progress on understanding how and when rebalancing should happen
334991,thanks
334992,there are many ways of doing it eg if the 30min univ3 twap goes out of the interval then do a rebalance the beauty of the approach is youre staying ilprotected when the price is out of range so theres no need to pick a precise point in time for the rebalance
334993,
334994,new hack it seems
334995,see thread for more info
334996,
334999,now thats smart
335000,not really
335001,at least for bridges which have latency in essence it would be nice security not sure about amm or other defi protocols
335002,ye for bridges not seeing it as negative per se but then think about what bridges can be used for the same defi protocols being multichain if bridges had this every protocol would need to be aave style multichain and not crosschain am i using the terms correctly
335003,
335004,could add some whitelisting on top idk
335005,yeah i believe in the next 18 months all major projects will introduce some form of withdrawal latencythe benefits outweight the downsides
335006,could definitely introduce a whitelist
335007,not totally about my own words tbh first it breaks the ethos and second it could partially defeat the purpose
335008,yeah you are correct
335009,i think better approach is to add priority execution feature to flashbots this priority execution is available only for special bots that tracks what happens inside defi protocols smart contracts are operations in mempool safe for em or not if bot sees some malicious operation it could can pause protocolrelatively speaking if all the top defi protocols implement such bots with passable feature this will rather reliably protect them from hacks
335010,i think eden already have onchain priority as a feature
335011,lol whats the beef missed the latest drama
335012,what i believe will happen is that projects will starting implementing architecture similar to bentobox kashi where you have multiple applications being built on top of bentobox but to exit the bentobox ecosystem in general there will be a withdrawal latencythat could be definitely interesting
335013,i am not seeing why youd think so
335014,or why youd think is possible
335015,well then you are creating an onchain cartel which no one can argue with sure it works somehow hell tradfi but how will you take into account main layer and gov tokens security do you strip those away
335016,that solves the composability issue as applications can collocate on a single vault eg bentobox so moving between applications you dont have to deal with the withdrawal latency
335017,anyone can build an application on top of bentobox today or what do you think the issue is
335019,but then you are fully trusting it basically unless i am slow which is true isnt that just yet another security concern less power to you more to em
335020,this works in theory but the hidden and huge complexity is in defining and detecting malicious operations while that is easy in the first iteration the attackers will adjust their attack to the rules you set in their next iterations eventually you would end up with a situation similar to the heuristic analysis of anti virus software meaning potential false positives lots of things missed huge loss of usability
335021,eden project openmev
335022,mistx flashbots rpc
335023,also consider that most frontrunners calculate what their opportunity is compared to the gas costs as they will simply sandwich you if its profitable to do so if you outbid them on gas costs and thus make sandwiching you unprofitable you wont be frontrun unless they run more sophisticated profitability algos that are context aware
335024,
335025,sam dissecting
335026,i wonder what the hacker did with the funds as they are broken up to really small ammounts as seen here
335027,the same goes for strategies as described in the initial tweet if you implement a delay of any kind relative to the withdrawal size the attacker will just split their execution into chunks from different addresses so then you would need to apply that rule to the total withdrawal throughput of your protocol and then you suddenly are limiting your normal users dead end the core issue with all of those things is the in my opinion fallacy that you can make statements about future attacks based on past attacks without assuming the attacker can do the same about protection mechanisms for example the wormhole attacker could likely have split their 80k weth withdrawl into 8000 1 weth without much effort
335028,the delay formula could take into account excessive number of addresses withdrawing in a short time frame but yeah sure create new kinds of problems
335029,you could average the withdrawal volume of your protocol and then lock it down if it exceeds ntimes that threshold thats basically what circuit breakers are tricky in defi because we like it when things run autonomously not sure if we would want protocols to be manually resumed even if its by multisigdao
335030,you basically will have to hire 1000 admins to respond to every small case
335031,building like that sounds like a problem with more overhead for anything you do
335032,yes maybe more secure but then more closed less agile and web2 hello
335033,yeah it just gets all very messy as soon as you go down this circuit breaker style road i get why the impulse to have this is there but i am really skeptical it could ever be implemented in a way thats net positive in terms of security gain vs decentralization and user experience
335034,reinventing fintech one step at a time
335035,anything already asynchronous like bridges is mostly fine with this addon
335036,and then after that we can add kyc so we can always catch the bad guys
335037,protocol that presume synchronous model will be fucked hard
335038,
335039,how would yearn be fucked exactly i thought it wasnt crosschain but if is why would reasonnable delays hurt them so badly plus it wouldnt necessarily mean more txs i supppose
335040,any lobster fam going to devconnect
335041,a ton see two possible amsterdam chats here
335042,sweeeeet
335043,
335044,what will be the main event ivangbi
335045,gearbox doing anything
335046,mev day seemed interesting
335047,eth global one of the main sponsors yas very much looking forward
335052,where can find data of how many users have interacted with smart contractsimilar to this sadly this one does not suits my needs good protection from parsing
335053,dune
335055,any alternatives for collabland for discord so many services appeared for token gated content but still havent seen anything for chats
335056,which services are there for token gated content
335057,
335058,lit gatewaymintgateunlock protocolalso plenty of stuff in thread
335059,thanks will check this out
335060,thank you
335062,whats the formula for the vecrv required to max out 25x lp boost
335063,look in the boosting paragraph here
335064,but there are interfaces to do this automatically
335065,is this the same for solidly
335066,its a math formula i dont think it changes depending on programming language me no dev sorry
335067,i meant the solidly project on fantom solidity the not language but np we will dig in probably that forked part is the same
335068,oh yeah i dont know how solidly work curve broke us enough
335073,shills get banned
335077,
335079,deleting explicit shills
335081,
335082,lol wtf funny
335083,based
335084,
335085,sent
335086,hi anybody can help with the first steps to put etherscan to a new chain to make smth like ftmscan should it be only through their team
335087,hi can someone pls explain how does the implementation process of approved proposals in daos workafter 10 years exp in law i understand that the process of transformation the decisions made and described in human language to form an llc to approve money spending etc into a legal statements in daos in code or the set of approved actions is not simple moreover the further interpretation of final legal statements can distort the initial intentionsso the question is who is in charge of implementation of decisions made by dao if were talking about decisions which requires code upgrade are there any companies who audit new code and confirm that new code fits the decision if no how can a usual daomember without itknowledge be sure that new code fits the decision if the decision requires certain actions are there any standards of how dao for example dao committees or other daos bodies should confirm that decision is properly implemented
335088,i dont want to step in anyones wallet and argue against the good will of the founding team here but this is a pretty big precedent to set up burn balance of one wallet to increase another hm
335091,thats far from what the model entails
335092,ignore the reply of speedy
335093,but why the wallet was not held by defiance at the moment of genesis
335094,so it is not defiances wallet
335095,lol omg
335096,i still dont understanding what happened here is 0x48 a defiance wallet or
335097,so who is the real owner wallet got compromised or not
335099,hey guys can anybody explain me this from secureum audit techniques 101 incident audit for reviewing an exploit incident root causing the incident identifying the underlying vulnerabilities and proposing fixesdoes this mean this type of audit is done when an exploit incident has occurred in public and company wants to check how it happened am i getting it right
335102,conceptually speaking depending on how governance is structured the entire protocol should be anon the holder base to not be domiciled anywhere but snapshot and multisig introduce a but of a thing1 governor alpha compound aave big ones have the automatic execution so they basically vote on code kinda if majority wrong well tough luck see the case of compound where a new improvement for rewards got exploited but at least here there is no gatekeeper no other external decision making party no one if passed quorum is gg technically and conceptually coleslaw meme code is law coleslaw 2 snapshot vote multisig does something then is a more tricky set up conceptually you want it to work like governor alpha so that a vote offchain happens and then multisig executes it but you have humans signing things here and there are 2 things which come with it legally speaking to some extent they can be seen as executives which can be ok but still is a degree of risk so to make sure token holders trust them these must be nonanon or semianon people otherwise it might as well be 1 person with 8 anon twitter accs right because there is a factual possibility to change before multisig enacts something it introduces a degree of subjectivity what if you found a bug just before implementation do you revote or proceed with correct code do you have to revote you kinda acting in good faith despite being subjectivebesides that sometimes daos go fully muh decentralized risking the general partnership liability but there have not been such cases yet and sometimes go via offshore or swiss association setup nothing is better nothing is worse we will see how things shape up once boomers figure out how to punish good hardworking devs again ps what happens often is misuse of governance like oh what coffee should we drink today or voting for not the actual contracts code thats just blablablz correct me everyone what is wrong and fk this legal mambo jumbo will be redacting nonfactual comments
335103,upgradeable erc20 tokens for your protocol yay or nay
335105,snapshot was trying to solve the problem with the 2nd with snapshot x but its yet to be released
335107,nathan_vdh can shill if he wants but ye the adapter is also a subjective move in a sense that it makes more pieces critical to your process yet rests upon some oracle which is meh was it like some gnosis custom oracle
335108,this may come in handy
335109,the actual problem is that those kinds of votes should be disputable in order to prevent a last minute attack dont know much about the details though
335110,simply speaking if you want trustless execution you need everything to happen on chain and you need to be damn sure your setup is correct right now with safesnap you can do it through snapshot but it does use the realityeth oracle from gnosis which is a game theory oracle it doesnt automatically execute anything
335111,snapshot x is a good solution but yeah not live yet but we think that once its live itll be the best solution
335112,solana question if you send funds to a token stake account are these recoverable
335113,i dont think that many people need completely trustless governance though i think you can take a few compromises that facilitate governance like a multisig or something personnaly im looking forward to snapshot x kleros so that theres some human interaction possible even after the result of a vote we all fuck up sometimes and id hate to see truly trustless execution be responsible for some big oof moments
335114,is frontrunning currently possible on optimism
335115,
335116,i guess you have to reach out to etherscan teamother explorers like blockscout open sourced so any one can host one on any chain eg it is the primary explorer used by xdai chain and otterscan more for developerslocal debugging may also work
335117,
335118,but we dont know who is the real owner of that wallet
335119,that might have been said for compliance purposes just fugezi idk if that matters even
335121,are there any solana devs here the hacker sent the usdc refunds to the users token accounts in staking contracts instead of to the users eoa are those usdc retrievable apparently the relevant staking contracts quarry and sunny are upgradable in case that helps
335122,yes contracts are upgradable by 6jtj2tdynyyzwkwy5mjwqyqhkqztadvnfra1hw1bzmkr prob controlled by a quarrysunny multi sig
335123,the last point is speculation
335124,hi all is there any stat on which chain are developers developing most on also is there any stat on number of blockchain developers by country my apologies of these questions have been asked earlier finding it difficult to ctrlf many thanks
335125,gives a certain party leverage on a platter
335126,hey fren can i discuss here about the tokens economics i have designed two models for inflation and deflation but i dont know which one is better
335127,fully ok to nonshill share designs and ask for feedback
335129,
335130,i am no expert and wo being biased for hopr sebastian being frens this is kinda cool right
335131,i think this was they hinted before have deja vu
335132,this and the fees are why i stopped using eth
335133,and this is why u use solana where there is no mev right hardcore sarcasm
335134,haha god no
335143,
335144,pretty interesting
335145,my two sets of designs are on twittermy project is to do decentralized search with a technical structure similar to the graph in the inflation model i wanted to use staking_rate as the regulation of the network but my partners proposed a deflationary model because our investors were also asking how the scarcity of our tokens would be reflected which confused me
335147,i wonder what of voting power is needed to do something with someone else assets its just me or does it sounds quite alarming and highly centralized
335148,i am not sure what you are asking because deflationary model burn token from revenue can only happen once u have revenue token incentives for data especially because buyer persona is very thin you will have inflation revenue absolutely always up until you escape that velocity blabla the typical doint turn on revenue model before having expanded hard and then milk users the resource seems to be kk u shared though the post the op is editing
335150,it does sound alarming to me but lido guys r good faith and this was done in good faith so i wont be on the other side tbh i dont think such things should even be possible from the erc20 contract standpoint no temptation then
335151,if there is any good counterargument im pretty interested to read it
335153,when you say decentralized search do you mean search as in google
335155,yes based on decentralized storage to make a search engine
335156,is there any way to turn jit liquidity from an attack into a default method for filling orders why do funds need to sit in a lp pool when traders could just signal their order and jit could compete to take itwas just reading this dumb money lp seems a waste when programmatic traders could use flash loans to fill swapsif uniswap orders are essentially limit orders then it would make sense to have bids to compete to fill them
335157,the model of inflation is based on the fact that the nodes token gains come from the protocol gains and thats when the regulation is in effect in fact most of the protocols node gains are not protocol gains but pumpdumpdoes staking regulation fail if early in the protocol most of the revenue does not come from users
335158,i agree
335159,curious who the target market is feels like you have much much bigger things to worry about than inflation
335160,in the early days i wanted to make a better mirror because there was no way to find what i wanted to see what i found was that the data format stored in arweave did not support search so we wanted to help arweave build a content index avoiding is advertising you can find our abbreviated model in that document on twitter i am referring to the graph
335161,i might be misunderstanding since the articles arent really clear and the website doesnt work first doc requires email too is this google but decentralized or sorta like google but for things on ethereum
335162,
335163,ser curious on ur thouhts here unless u prefer to ghost there which i can understand no beef
335164,ahhh more info soon
335165,wider initiative getting in people not just from polygon
335166,muh initiative ser u know how ngos and other muh organizations committees work
335167,gib core devs money if u wanna make a change otherwise is just larp sowwy
335168,in this specific context not in other cases
335169,yes im in charge of designing the token economy which is the design of a protocol not a dappethereum is the settlement layer which is similar to thegraph search for arweave with ipfs miners run a service to search against the storage so a token incentive for miners is needed i know that downloading all the data for a centralized search is a good way to go the best user experience comes from centralization but not blockchain
335170,ah okay that makes sense
335171,i have been looking into decentralized file stores databases say we want to record a users actions on our platform and record data about it in an immutable mannerbut not on the blockchain we are usingarweave and ipfsfilecoin seem to have a lot of solutions for persisting files and websitesbut what about more of a database where we could send data to and be able to prove that it was never altered and always available
335172,there are a number of proposals in the arweave community people store layer1 data up so that the storage will become layer0
335175,sounds like something an l2 would be able to provide in the future possibly with a subgraph in the mixnot sure if current solutions exist what youre describing is essentially a blockchain
335176,ipfs cids give us that never altered guarantee others try to promise permanence like arweave some ipfs based database solutions like orbitdb have been attempted thats probably the closest to what youre describing me thinks
335177,hi frens does anybody know if on blockchain explorer if the wallet belongs to a cex will it say
335178,
335179,i know it does on etherscan
335180,amlbotcom investigation regime only not simple check which costs slightly less then investigation will show clusters same does crystalblockchaincom but you have to buy their product
335181,friend of mine got scammed and we went to track the funds and monitor if it goes to a cex

335183,
335184,ty
335185,btw maybe this is nitpicking but keep in mind that usually non tamperable is not sufficienteg you also need to ensure data is true to begin with eg signed by the user and that data cant be omitted by you
335186,
335187,yesyes i need shitcoin blz gib
335188,
335189,only by the stake account owner the account needs to be closed and then the sol funds need to be returned to you by the account owner
335190,fantom lol
335191,yes confirmed ty
335192,bizarre celo included but ftm not lol
335193,anyone following the oktalapsus incident closely any crypto involvement so far

335218,across
335219,syn
335220,li finance probably upcoming
335221,there are 30 bridges afaik all will have a shitcoin likely
335222,ps lets not everyone have a chance at saying 1000 names thats gonna be flood ask a q
335223,youre right sorry was looking into doing a sort of fair valuation for when stargate bridge launches and its current tvl makes sense
335224,thanks for sharing
335225,were very focused on our gotomarket productmarketfit and overall stability of not only the product but also the organization we wont launch a token anytime soon
335226,say it again brother
335227,hello fellow friends can anyone explain me such thing the pending tx with the highest gas in mempool do not guarantee executes first the highest gas only guarantee that it will executes in next block but in random order and other tx in mempool even with lower gas fee can be execute in front of the highest am i right
335228,its related to golang impl of ethnode
335229,biconomy hyphen and synapse have their token out as well
335230,elk has as well tho its also crosschain yield farm as well as a bridge
335232,okok enough suggestions blz there are dozens halfworking bridges we gonna die before naming em all
335233,anyone know anyone from etherscan
335234,yes but unless its critical issue better not but them they are busy as is
335235,frens is contract flattening still a thing or there are better ways for deployment

335238,small reminder that its the last day to claim your airdrop on cowswap if you were eligible to it you needed to have used cowswap in the past or being a gno holder the claiming is available on cowswap ui with a claim button on top right corner similar to what was used on uniswap etc smaller airdrops 10000 vcow are on gnosis chain previously xdai half of the eligible addresses on gnosis chain didnt claimed their airdrop yet its only available until march 25th and also now you can vote on snapshot to enable the conversion from non transferable vcow to cow which will become transferabletradable from march 28th if the vote is in favor of it which is the case right nowsorry if my message isnt okay for any reason feel free to delete
335239,a closer look at the lapsus data extortion grouparticle comments
335240,nan
335241,do you feel kind of 2018 vibe i think its seasonal rotation of devs from ef to altchains
335242,i think its pretty hard to build something on eth if you noname
335243,so newcomers build on altchains without big corpo protocols and 100500 conpetitors
335244,you probably dont get who is peter
335245,sure it is
335246,well some big uncles also do something for altchains although looking at ftm i am more against this than for
335247,its more elon low qual shilling then maybe
335248,i dont know the only meaningful alt chains i remember from back then are eos and binances the first was often criticized for things most projects are quelle surprise praised for today and the second was icos are scamsso i cant say i remember anyone like peter doing that
335249,any freelance researchers that are into nfts and looking for some work in exchange for eth here or want to get funded to do research on something theyre passionate about dm me blz too short of a gig for the hr channel
335250,seems like both peter and aya lack the skill to lead a team if youre the lead at geth go to your employer and get a reasonable compensation for your team and whatever else you need youre in the driver seat hereand if youre the boss of the ef you better make sure that people whove been working at a core product since 6 years stay and have a great working environmentbut whining about compensation on twitter and talking about how great a competitor is that youve bashed previously is a strange way to get attention especially from a team lead
335251,does anybody have indepth educational or documentational material about tornado cash nova the docs are pretty light and high level farm42 perhaps

335261,nope
335262,just twitter
335263,the idea is to prevent players from widely influencing each other during the games
335264,
335265,got to say have been using euler for a while now really impressed
335266,so theres a 7 day window to buy tickets by locking up dola for 3 months im assuming there will be more games added beyond the medal game will there be other opportunities to buy more tickets for new games or is it final after the 7 day window closes
335267,
335269,goldmansachscom thats it
335270,nan
335271,you will use the same tickets for all the games in this round 3 months after 3 days from now no more tickets will be issued
335272,does anyone have suggestions for sol rpc servers syndica isnt even letting me sign up due to a bug on their registration page lol
335273,pretty comprehensive proposalbut tldr isnt it just 2 spread model
335274,hey guys an acquaintance of mine from traditional academia is doing research into daos and she asked for help navigating the crypto world the question isare there any smart contracts that automate salary payout regularly anything thats deployed on the blockchain and is actually in use
335275,look up sablier or more generally
335276,the idea of regular payments is kind of gone when it can simply be proportional and within every block rather than the traditional monthly pay day
335277,excuse me proportional to what
335278,the idea is that you are paid immediately and consistent for value added
335279,rather than a monthly pay cheque
335280,so each and every block you receive a fractionalised part of your salary
335281,and that is done normally by hand right
335282,every 10 seconds someone hits the pay button
335283,
335284,thanks
335285,the question rather how does one automate determining who adds how much value but thats besides the scope atm
335286,this is to replace the payment process for someone that traditionally would be on a fixed salary
335287,impossible to automate the process of determining value creation
335288,id simply add comments to git all day and make commits to inflate my numbers
335289,this comes to mind
335290,convert spaces to tabs in entire project and vice versa then
335291,
335292,are you looking for work dm
335293,effectuk paid to the people who catcheskilled cobras instead of decreasing cobras population people started adopting and increasing cobras population to get more rewards from uk govt
335294,also check out superfluid
335296,check gnosis safe spent limits this tool is very easy to use as a automated salary weeklymonthly from the multisig
335297,superfluid is probably my favorite protocol out there right now i love the idea that payroll can be drastically overhauled why do we get checks every two weeks or every month its a remnant of paper banking thats kind of made its way into our culture why not have your salary flow into your account in a steady stream constantlywe have the technology to do that nowsuperfluid is dope
335298,i always keep spare cobras at home in the off chance this policy gets reinstated again
335299,im just thinking about how to solve this perverse incentives issue with cobrasreward must be reduced in proportion of cobras population increased basically its cobras bonding curve
335300,it underpins the whole mechanism design problem space the game you thought you won falls apart when the protocol evolves case in point you could argue that bitcoins hodl is a perverse incentive this is why i am generally bearish on any solution that uses crypto economics because there will always be edge cases you have planned for maths on the other hand
335301,this is why you need daos to adapt the mechanisms
335303,re daos flat orgs
335305,i dont think daos have to be flat in fact a perfectly flat org is basically impossible and leads to tyranny of structurelessness problems as is mentioned in the article dao subdao structures are a way to build stratified decision making without it being a management authority chain
335307,why no optimism in that lobsterdaily poll cant answer truthfully now
335308,such polls make 0 sense anyway lobstersaily is a communitycurated separate channel btw
335309,alexpgc21 ser tbh poll makes no sense
335310,whyi tend to agree that we have to reduce discussionsshills like which chain is better but how to collect an alternative data about number of users across chainsprobably public pool isnt a best idea here will be deleted but as a defi researcher and protocols engineer i need stat like thisso i think its better to organize a typeform ux survey in the lobs chats
335311,halfassed data is worse than no data imho you dont need telegram people wrongly clicking multiple choice questions so see what people use
335312,isnt the best data actual on chain data in this case rather than a biased non random sample
335313,nopebecause tvl dex volumes active accounts number of txs they are all vanity metrics for non eth chainsalternative info we can track for number of usersusage are kyced cex accounts or web traffic or properly managed surveys
335314,of course use of isolated metrics arent great indicators of usageusability but comparisons and combinationsmore complex metrics without a doubt give an order of magnitude better indicator than a poll or survey
335315,context is also key in deciphering these metrics which would be gathered by doing deeper research to exclude outliers
335316,context on usage is something that could potential offer insights from polls surveys done right
335317,i dont think its a bad thing to do these kinds of polls as long as they arent taken too seriously
335318,its useful data as context alongside other data to make a big picture
335319,yes agree data can be useful only from properlycarefully managed surveys within specific chatsgroupscontexts
335320,if you use it as a sole source of truth of course its stupid
335321,those are some impressive examples lol one with crypto stuff would be interesting liquidity mining ought to make the cut
335322,airdrops too almost everything in crypto
335323,imo the issue is agency and autonomy not org shape there are useful precedents in decentralised coordination that have worked through many of the secondorder effects holocracy valve games semco goretex kiwanis biker clubs livery guilds gnulinux barcamp im still trying to understand why daos havent looked at them moremaybe one reason is the small set of onchain tools they skew to employmentfreelancer norms which have horrible secondorder effects that we just accept as normal that makes them familiar and adoptable but also leave entire categories of coordinationremuneration unaddressed
335324,could also be related with unclear regulations and trying to avoid liability
335326,i find it interesting that its like a bunch of companies and other well known stuffs but just in the middle bikers clubs lol
335327,i agree i was into decentralised organisations long before daos if you scrape away the hype its the just the potential of daos as tools for decentralised organising thats the exiting thing agree on the tooling thing too exactly what im working on
335328,hells angels definitely an awesome example of a decentralised organisation
335330,surely the hells are super centralised each band pays homage to their mother chapter and pays tribute to it each has a geographically defined area to operate it and they frequently visit each other theres always a chapter president with a sergeant at arms etc with many defined roles in a clubhouse im reading a book on them rn id have to disagree
335331,everything on that list is centralized not sure why were redefining centralized as decentralized
335332,bittorrent the company is centralized bittorrent the protocol is decentralized centralized isnt a bad word
335333,welcome to my brain ser actually biker clubs were modeled on community service orgs like kiwanis and the boy scouts which have a lineage to quakers and freemasons hells angels didnt start as a criminal org but as support group for war vets who considered themselves outsiders and wanted freedom in the criminal phase they became more paramilitary in shape
335334,none of the things you mentioned there are dealbreakers for decentralised org
335335,true that its all relative really i mention those because all have strong aspects political decentralisation less orgwide policy and logical decentralisation fewer single sources of truth especially in ways that could be useful to some of the dao pains these days
335336,
335337,enjoy
335338,they arent binaries its a continuum and all that
335339,i dunno when you get down to it a decentralized organization as opined by cryptonians is something of a square circle
335341,i have a pretty niche solidity evm question anyone know off the top of their head if this has any sketchy implications
335342,i have a deployed contract a that calls another contract bs function foo external i plan to deploy a new version of contract b which we can call b that now returns a uint256 with foo function foo external returns uint256 and then have contract a point to b for the call to foo ive written a test to ensure that foo can still be called by a when b is swapped in the return type is not included in the function selector which is nice but i just want to be extra sure im not screwing anything up behind the scenes by now having a return value given to a
335343,if anyone has resources i can read about to learn how to answer that question then thats also appreciated
335344,contract a will ignore the value returned by contract b it should not have any unintended side effects
335345,hope you see it now
335346,much appreciated sir
335347,the problem is that this rule exclusively depends on good faith theres no way to verify whos staking on maple and where their funds come from neither maple nor anyone else can enforce it personally i am not even sure if there is a problem here its just a side effect of the way the protocol is designed the more interesting question is how the whole thing will adapt once there are no mpl to emit left
335348,well i just proved that amber group abuses the f out of it
335349,and they approve it
335350,is it abuse if they approved it
335351,i get your concern but i believe that you either see this as a design flaw or you accept it being used like that either way there is not much merit in overly blaming the actors there never was any doubt that this was technically possible and it would be naive to assume it wouldnt happen at some pointmaple basically has two ways to respond to this we know this is possible and its working as intended or we know its possible and we are working on fixing it saying we do not want this to happen in general but in this case its okay because introduces some sort of casebycase stance on the issue and just confuses lenders and other borrowersthe point of this isnt to fud maple i just think its an interesting case because there are not many protocols doing uncollateralized loans and now we get to discuss the side effects
335352,but they already said in the past cases that this is not allowed when they responded to the claims about mgnrio
335353,yeah of course if ag were smarted they would have done it in a way that would be way harder to detect
335354,but they werent they were caught and maple still says its ok
335355,thats bs
335356,mappe plz gib uncollateralizeed loan im gud guy
335357,just scroll in their discord and see their responses when people were complaining about mgnrio
335358,i feel like that topic was discussed 3 times not sure why bringing it up again its a protocol issue blz fin this is circular now
335359,because maple took a stance that this is not ok if proven and now someone did it on a 78x larger scale than mgnrio and maple approves it
335362,
335363,
335364,miners colluding
335365,hey peeps something odd is happening with the recent blocks like most of the blocks are with very less utilisation
335366,gas prices still smokin high
335368,having alternating filled and empty blocks increases the gas limit because the rebase calculation is based on a fixed percentageif a block is full the base gas price increases by 125 and if a block is empty it decreases by 125if 1 full and 1 empty block follows each other then the total change is 1012510125 0984 that is essentially a gas limit increase of 16in reality all blocks are not completly empty or completly full so the true gas limit increase from this mathematical quirk is smaller but still present
335369,guys any tools for tokenomics modeling simulation
335370,if miners could gain from colluding lower base cost higher priority i will let you the reader decide
335371,
335372,thanks any example applications of the tool to tokenomics
335373,the token engineering commons crew are the masters of this stuff and have some lovely resources and courses

335380,
335381,they shouldve stayed frosty
335382,treading on thin ice mustve slipped up
335383,mev is an important problem but it can be solved directly in an l1 beacon chain shutter provides a solution for that a set of nodes compute an encryption key using a dkg protocol let users encrypt their transactions with it and release the decryption key once the encrypted transactions are in the chain this technique can be applied to ethereumlike beacon chains by using the validator set to run the dkg protocol and introducing a scheduling mechanism for encrypted transactions can also be implemented in roll ups

335490,brief thread on hacks and requirement of nondiscretionary parametric insurance instead of incumbents like nexusmutual who reject payouts
335491,
335492,while the insurance market still has yet to be cracked vcs shilling their bags is
335493,there is no product or token mate just posted it as an example its plain content
335494,but there will be in 2 yrs and your saft will finally be free to dump on retail the example is interesting but without anything functional this just reads as a slide deck for now
335495,it just shows the issues in the current protocols and what new products are trying to do you seem to have problems with the present non functional as well as future functional
335496,silence vc your optimism doesnt work here we all hate ourselves and each other too muchthis is the alt of tejas_gravityx look at what he tweets

335511,i think hes asking for it
335512,defi insurance is still a fake track1
335513,i disagree to a large extent because nobody wants to cover the financial losses like options contracts most are only covering for the exploits of smart contracts
335514,
335515,good overview of how doj made the case against the nft ruggers
335516,it doesnt seem like any hacking incidents are fully covered by insurance prove that the existing mechanism cannot take effect
335517,how to prove that the neptune mutual contract will not have bugs and the mining strategy will not have accidentsanother defi game in a insurance shell
335518,
335519,what does it mean like vcs are searching an opportunity to buy from the cexesdexes because private valuations are too far away from reality
335520,u understood it correctly ser
335521,lets keep any companies like neptune aside for the discussion as i do not intend to highlight any specific projects lets only consider issues in the insurance products today there are 2 major hurdles first is defi insurances work in a centralized manner users have to prove the loss of funds in exploits while filing for the claims there are committees or appointees who are representing the insurance platform such folks go through the claim examine the issues and decide whether to payout the insurance claim or not based on their own discretionand second is each user has to file the claim separately if there is an exploit it affects all users who bought insurance cover and should be paid all at once irrespective of whether they file the claim or not some platforms even have kycs
335522,for current ecosystem to take effect there should to be some level of decentralization and discretionary approach needs to go away and mass settlements are required thats all i believe for now
335523,any dune wizards around
335524,i remember that ethereumtraces used to have a call trace column like 1_2_3_2
335525,something like that
335526,but i dont see it anymore am i missing something
335527,eliasimos
335528,ofc its elias lol
335529,do you think claims response speed is more important than claims ratio this is confusing the main business of insurancenxm needs kyc which makes me feel bad and wnxms longterm deanchoring makes people have no desire to buy
335530,isnt that the column trace_address
335531,optimizing the claims process doesnt give you points if users cant get full compensation
335532,oooooh you might be right it was empty but that might be because i happened to get only direct entry calls
335533,nan
335534,yes thats it thank you
335535,now i only have to figure out how to work with arrays
335536,people advise an analogue of sablier to pay salaries in crypto if there are such it is desirable that taxes can be configured
335537,claims ratio is more important imo but speed is also being improved risk management marketplaces like riskharbor intend to do automatic claim settlements a very short period after the exploits

335548,thematic is interesting though i find it interesting that thematic exchanges havent gotten more volume i wonder if thats representative of web3
335549,like theres no dex or cex that only lists privacy coins for example
335550,too early in market cycle you need to reach a stage before that can happen
335551,so will nfts skip straight there
335552,or else you bifurcate small userbase and die on low volume yes nfts and tokens are different in that each nft tx is worth 10k token exchanges per trade can be far smaller
335553,interesting
335554,gmv economics very different in both asset categories
335555,tinderbumble aggregated disappointmentu cant say it more precisely
335556,
335558,pretty cool ser any token
335560,i highly recommend this for simulation

335564,bro wutweve got defiintegrated nfts if they want them and that makes sense to mebut a metaverse play is a bit of an odd choice for a company that just raised 32m
335565,i love this should do a follow up with a feemodel for aggregators on the same and how effective they are with loyaltycreating barrier to entry the least criticised onesatleast prelarge scale adoption seem to be the ones with nonapparent fee and the least user pushback uber amazon etceffectively the aggregators that are able to bundle up their fee on top of the cost of the service they agregated tend to scale even fasterit also enables to monetise every transaction on the network if you can manage a nonfluctuating of the same awesome network effects mean your growth directly translates into revenue growth something probably more projects should incorporate from the beginning freemium subscription mark up are the three other broad ones but havent been able to see any have that kind of success
335566,not currently no
335567,i retract my pretty cool assessment until such a time as i can profit from this
335568,seriously tho id use this definitely not any one place i can see everything so great you guys are building it
335569,samkazemian hanging with the index coop
335570,haha i feel you
335571,what do you miss most on a current cryptovcs scene

335577,on polygon full game launch on 31st of march
335578,which aggregators do we consider for this if you give me a list i can get cracking
335579,100 percent

335581,what makes aavegotchi non hyperinflationary
335582,sers has anyone used trustology
335583,
335584,idk tbh im the founder or whatever of the biggest p2e community on reddit tokenomics and weak vcs killed the market imopeople blame the games but vcs cucked the hype tbh
335585,would you be able to provide an example of what you could consider good tokenomics for a p2e
335586,interesting if thats the case then is there any good tokenomics for a p2e
335587,yes lets start with long vesting dumping on ultra nooobs is not cool
335588,six months lock linear over 3 years decent or meh in your opinion
335589,nah vesting should be flexible if market is dead then no unlocksrespect the people that are using the protocol game or whatever
335590,were considering that tbh thanks for your input
335591,hyperinflation happens when there is an increase of supply and the demand for the token shrivelsi would like to know how that could work with token design
335592,cant agree here even tho safts always change always have its generally not okay to have unlocks change besides they should ideally be onchain changing peoples vestings who work on the other hand and those who farm outside users arbitrarily is surely not okay alkdt1
335593,when people play to earn farm the tokens then dump them what would create a demand so high that selling them under a certain price would be unfavourable
335594,its a dilemma
335595,either the smartest or dumbest move they can do i like the balls to do it approach
335596,understandablei guess thats why there is never a clear cut formula for these matters
335597,im watching outer ring closely
335598,hey some of you saw the post i wrote about maplefinance and amber group i was hoping to get an answer from the maple team as of if there are other borrowers that are doing this as i think that maple users should be aware if this is happening they completely ignored me not surprising so i was hoping i could ask you if you could help me make them answer the question if more people ask they wont be imo able to ignore it also if you liked my post i would be thankful if you would consider retweeting it as i think that maple lenders should be aware of what is happening
335599,speak to journalists maybe the defiant is a good place to start
335600,what makes it different
335601,any other suggestions on who could i try to reach
335602,the block coindesk cointelegraph yahoo finance bloomberg forbes
335603,could post in lobster chat every few days about it
335604,ok for real 5th time bringing up the same thing next time legit permamute
335605,i am actually on your side conceptually speaking but you are fighting with windmills please dont do that here anymore entire venture world is weird finance is all a scam we have president trading his company reserves on robinhood options anyway tldr
335606,didnt mean to spam sorry for that i am just trying to do a good thing and i needed some advice
335607,
335608,forgot to share before
335609,reads sexy and ofc is a nice futuristic idea but i am not sure such coordination can be expected there is only so many people who have enough capacity to understand a protocol less so willing to act less so having the time to act expecting them to self organize in subdaos after that seems like a dream to me not a reality unless i am bot fully following the concept
335610,weird thread tbh its like lets ignore the realities of participation today
335611,token incentives are not enough alone to effectively organize coordinate communities i honestly think this is actually the only guaranteed way to ensure anything in crypto
335612,tokenholders are not users users might be token holders design accordingly
335613,i think supply sided and demand sided are just not the correct the phrases if the larger logic was that make a profuct announce you are dao and see who all contribute while who all are just happy to lurk and wait to buy or use protocol to earn token can enable you to build a strong network for the token that the dao eventually launched then yeah on point but you cant consider these subdaos though even different functions arent subdaos because they cant function alone creates silos
335614,nvm there is more to this index coop to set protocol alchemist to covalent etc so is quite bueno
335615,a subdao by definition should be a smaller unit that could self sustain and work on the overall project created by the parent dao for a subset of usersgeographyyada yada or am i wrong
335616,ye so lets not call them subdaos
335617,they are literally projects on top
335618,bottommiddle whatever u like
335619,domidao
335620,that thread is actually pretty close to gearbox though by locking the token thats what effectively has been achieved
335621,people forgot about token and actually started working towards the protocol
335622,i feel like the core workers are now on a good path so in a month or so we can think of fostering these subdaos to emerge not sure where to start though those are good ideas though
335623,i think we should go with vertical and skill compilation before subdaos going to more chainsl2s is where subdaos should come into play would be fun though
335624,crypto unicorns and sipher imo sipher even wrote a good 3part series on the same focus on games modeling for players vs earners and crypto unicorns got everything right with their utility token so far
335625,
335626,this is an excellent find
335627,is there a way to get alerts i was thinking a telegram bot but anything is ok for a change of asset distributionpercentage in a curve pool
335629,try using the last one or etherdrops_bot
335633,nice i cant see no change of percentage distribution in the option though
335638,does anybody have a model for the optimal deposit size in pooltogether given their prize structure i would guess a yearn strategy must have done this modeling at some point
335639,i found and mirrorxyzthumbsupfinanceethdcwr2lj07da1jwqgbzsxzjwcdx0ptq9x7sl_gzr5hks with tokenbricexyzpooltogether if anyone will find a good strategy please share3
335640,crypticfollower not sure if sorted out but trading view shows total for all crypto and total2 excludes btc and ethi have no clue on source and accuracy
335648,i want to get info tx detailsreceipt from latest 10 blocks what eth client should i run and how much its size
335649,thanks i forgot those
335651,is sushi asking everyone to sign a tx before a swap or just me
335652,u mean the signature its same for 1inch and a few others now including uniswap comes from the new permit allowance although that has been there for a few weeks already
335653,i rarely use sushi
335654,so i just tried it now and prompted a signature before a tx
335655,thought it was weird is it normal then
335656,it is if its an asset approval that is a sign instead of a tx so u spend less gas
335657,improved ux kinda
335658,yep eip2612 if you want to look it up
335659,but as always check what it is that youre signing of course
335660,
335661,history and stats of all blockchain hacks
335662,or crypto hacks i should say since this includes cexs and probably social engineering attacks
335663,hello community i have such a task to build a line for paying salaries with crypto in it completely from the legal purchase of crypto to tax deductions and collecting the necessary reports i roughly imagine this path but i may not know the nuances and this is often important does anyone have such experience and can i write in a personal if you are ready to help
335664,or maybe someone has a link at hand to a description of a similar experience or something like that the company is registered in cyprus but i would study with pleasure the experience in other countries
335665,this by the way is part of the mass adoption that we are waiting for
335666,this is highly dependent on the countries of the employer and employee even if you were to do this without crypto it would require a shitton of legalaccount knowledge and work there is no one you can just ask you probably need to hireconsult some professionals
335669,yes i suspect that not everything is so simple and this is not the shortest way but you need to start somewhere every journey starts with the first steps

335671,sure how are you thinking on adding the 1000 addresses some csv merkletree tokennft holders should it be encrypted to individual recipient to all recipients or not at all any sample of the message and how you would like them to see it eg yourdomaindotcomcampaign10x12345
335672,well have a csv largely want to send the message to all the steth holders who are lping in crv
335673,ah damn im going to get one of those lol
335674,does it need to be encrypted is it going to be the same message or different based on whatever
335675,hey is there any good documentation to understand how ohm or time bootstrapped their treasury
335676,what i am confused about is if each ohm has an intrinsic value of atleast 1 dai where did that value come from when it was launched
335677,how much work is it for circle to freeze and reissue usdc the cashio hacker has refunded about 2m to people which had less than 100k however those refunds are stuck in the staking protocols user token accounts which also hold their lp tokens which they staked in the protocolcircle could freeze those usdc in these unretrievable token accounts there are many though and reissue to the users eoas
335678,do let me know if you have any luck with this as i have a bunch of usdc stuck in a contract too from what i gathered they require law enforcement to request it have been thinking about suing myself
335679,i suspect that was seed money
335680,is this native usdc or some bridged verison if its the bridged verison how could bridged usdc be frozen asking as a brainlet

335691,when ledger live say its a genuine ledger is it 100 safe i am always worried when i use a new ledger
335694,maybe reinstall firmware from trusted live binary as well
335695,i usually update firmware with ledger live
335696,ok thanks
335699,yes trusted ledger live binary i meant
335700,i just started to use ledger with phantom wallet on solana it seems to work well any risk to use it like this i had many issues in the past with metamask so now i use frame for all evm chain and it works like a charm
335701,it seems to me that 510 of apps wont work with frame even after choosing the act as metamask option is this not your experience
335702,
335703,probably commissioned by ava but likely not too bad otherwise didnt read
335704,can you start transactions with it you couldnt even do a simple send when i tried it last years
335705,usdc on solana is native
335706,yeah frame is super unstable i wanted to get rid of met but the ux is just 1000x better i literally couldnt connect to custom rpcs using frame and just gave up after a while
335707,rabby
335708,hey guys anyone know where i can find historical gas prices for various l1 blockchains compared on a chart
335709,well etherscan has a stats page and etherscan is also available on different l1s eg aurora avalanche fantom so i assume the respective etherscan offers charts for those blockchains not sure if an multichain chart exists
335710,rabby has the same sort of issues as frame in my experience just wont work with some apps even more so than frame the one thing it does better is that it remembers which chain you want to use with a given app which is usually really helpful fwiw the frame devs claim this is on their roadmap
335711,i used it a bit and so far so good
335712,is dis legit
335713,
335714,yes
335715,chrome preferences search updates check for updates restart
335716,basically some exploits were possible no info yetto prevent them for your mm or another web3 wallets we have to urgently update chrome to the newest versionright
335717,people saying update brave too
335718,google chrome users are highly recommended to update to the latest version 990484484 for windows mac and linux to mitigate any potential threats users of chromiumbased browsers such as microsoft edge opera and vivaldi are also advised to apply the fixes as and when they become availablebrave is based on chromium so yes its too
335719,fwiw thn isnt hn

335722,dubai has big crypto community
335723,ohh damn missed it pls ping me for he next one
335724,ngmi
335725,hey quick q guys anyone have examples of twitter threads where people got phished for their nfts or whatever else
335730,
335731,1 speaking about urban styleyes its a city with many centers sub cities like downtown marina palm creek lamer bluewaters expo and etc there is no way to walk between such spots only car but you can find comfortparkswalking streets and embankments within such areas2 speaking about its business model do we have zero tax free zones in us or eu also no tax for incomewealth for residents people are earning money and instead of paying taxes they are spending money locally for hotels real estate cars restaurants and etcevery placecountrycity has its pros and cons there is no reason to spread hate
335744,hi does anyone know how to check if your ledger is genuine am currently using a mac
335746,ledger live app should check this for you but you should first feel comfortable with provider only direct from company is considered valid
335749,yea i downloaded the ledger live app but it ask me to connect unlock your device when i am using mac the usb is incompatible bought it from
335750,if you ordered it from the company the physical packaging arrived intact and the app when you connect it to ledger live and allow the app to connect it checks it
335751,how do you know the app is connected to ledger live bro its low on batt right now i need to charge it
335752,the packaging comes with usb for charging not to connect to a mac
335753,it will go through an initialisation proceedure and yeah if you have a mac which only has usb c you will need a dongle or an alternate cable
335754,yea need an alternate cable
335755,so wait my ledger needs to be connected via cable to the macbook thought its bluetooth watched the video it did not explicitly state the part on connecting to laptop
335756,they do gaslight you a bit used mm only for years got a couple ledgers this year and also thought you could bluetooth it guess thats just for phone use
335757,nano x has
335758,the bluetooth on nano x works only with the mobile app they dont give a fck supporting it everywhere else
335759,
335760,i opened an issue requesting support for bluetooth on ledger live three years ago absolutely no response
335761,although there is support for bluetooth in their sdk i was able to scan my addresses from desktop a long time ago using a sample code
335764,alright so only mobile i still need buy an adapter then so annoying their cable thanks guys
335765,
335766,not shilling but why did people only talk about lido rpl with eth 20 staking how about ssv network
335767,hey guys by any chance would anyone here have one extra ticket for ethdubai
335768,in connection to the hardwallet discussed about what do you guys think the best one ledger or trezor
335769,dont know about trezor have been using ledger nano s for 5 years now and it has tons of hick ups but it works for me
335770,just check the support for the chains you use
335771,its mostly the same aside from that
335772,cant believe were still using the same interface mm and hardware as 2017 in this mega fast growing tech space
335773,use frame
335774,yes i started with that still need to inject metamask cause most project dont support frame as of yet
335775,but it is quite an upgrade i agree
335776,you can use frame for everything
335777,if you have any problem with an app just click on the frame browser extension and click show as metamask
335778,
335779,lmao lets continue in nft_avenue
335780,anyone take a look at this pretty good read on fat protocol theory for eth
335781,is frame as battle tested as mm tho
335782,thats great to see people trying to conceptualise but i feel this is applying too much vc concepts ie a private illiquid market to crypto liquid speculative markets meta matters more than actual value chain capture in this world chia is coming from traditional vc investing with saison capital so not entirely surprising
335783,if things were rational things like ltc or etc etc would be at zero for a long time ie market dynamic and meta matter more than proper value capture
335784,only the pump is real
335785,mb you mean israel
335786,ltc is actually launching mimble wimble i believe
335787,will be highest mcap privacy coin
335788,rewrite in rust and go full anime on homepage and we have a contender
335789,
335790,not shilling just reporting back that everything was fixed turned back on by multisig
335791,the whitehat is a legend we also opted to gib a bit more gear as an extra reward on top
335792,
335793,lol
335794,wdyt degens
335795,help coingecko become better again
335796,some thing not easy to collect major emission avg emission influation rate
335797,
335798,separating the dao funds from the rest is a good idea but its also not easy to collect
335799,dao wallet is just 1 wallet usually
335800,if i understand your intention correctly then its not just dao but any wallet that has funds for community driven spendinga foundation wallet has the same goals just centralized leadership technically should also be separated no
335801,foundation wallet always ends up being misused and foundation cant just print more that usually results in delistings and or hard abandoning community consensus is a diff thing
335802,oh yeah seems fine i realized that it was dev who went to apply to coingecko not coingecko to collect
335803,oh god pls yes tired of seeing people talk about fdv when 70 of your supply is simply not allocated
335804,70 unallocated is quite low lots of coins are 97595 locked
335805,locked unallocated there is dao spending which really is not fdv but any inflation lm that is already allocated fdv
335806,ah misunderstood
335807,ivangbi maybe im missing something here in the logicisnt the whole point of fdv to say this is where the market cap can reach if all tokens enter circulationtechnically dao foundation market maker vesting team staking what ever all are tokens that exist and can easily enter circulationonly difference is that maybe dao spending is above board and transparent to all investors no
335808,at least thats how i view fdv how many tokens might enter circulation over time
335809,daos spent like 1 of their spending each so far even tho a few are like 1 year old its really that they will never ever in 5 years even spend more than 50 of what they have so its really not fdv in that sense do i make more sense now
335810,yeah i get thatbut its similar to removing token emissions from fdv because the emission rate is only 12 a yearthose tokens do exist and can be spentanyway i dont have much to add so will stop here
335811,nobody inflates at 12 a year only its either larger or close to 0
335812,bitcoin inflates at 175 at the moment
335813,ok fuck you win fine
335814,sorry
335815,
335816,it is fdv because in principle those tokens can end up on the open market at some point in the future the speed or conditions under which that happens are not relevant in my opinion if you are interested in that just look at the current circulating supply which is all tokens not wallets that are subject to special conditions
335817,if coingecko wants to improve they could work on actually tagging the different wallets with their specific conditions and maybe even generate token distribution charts based on that a new metric of the same category as marketcap and fdv is not really neededalso all of those metrics are basically uselessmisleading without strict due dillegence right now you can feed coingecko an api returning an arbitrary number and they will accept that as circulating supply afaik correct me if i am wrong herein general any projectwallet that does not commit to the declared vestingreleaseinflation schedules via smart contracts should be highlighted as well simply because its not verifiable whether they will stick to the conditions the way things currently work are way too trust basedthe basic assumption should be that all minted tokens are circulating supply then projects should be able to submit conditions for specific addresses to correct that but as soon as the onchain movement invalidates those conditions the circulating supply should increase again
335820,cg do collect this data namely specific wallets for foundation team wallets vesting terms not sure if these are actively monitored to adjust circ vs fdv
335821,afaik they just show wallets that are substracted from the circulating supply without any further information except for a name and thats optional you can also just feed them your own api with whatever you want it will be accepted as circulating supply its the right idea but the validation and presentation could be improved
335822,
335823,hey guys does anyone here work or know someone at dydx we could get in touch with please
335824,what delightful process quality
335825,big weekend for exploits
335828,are there onchain things to look at
335829,
335830,
335831,does anybody know if theres been a stablecoin protocol that was only partially backed like not even its overcollateralized by its own token straight up the market value of backed assets is less than the market value of the stablecoincontext ive started designing one such protocol and i have a bunch of ideas on how to achieve this but i was wondering what existing ideas are out there
335832,its a wonderful idea
335833,esd is a successful implementation of this concept
335834,like fraxfractionally backed by usdc
335835,or more like segniorage coins like esdbacked only by monetary policy
335836,well the market value of fxs usdc is equal or higher to that of frax
335837,yeah i am trying to understand his question still
335838,said an esd whale kek
335839,alleged
335840,hey folks would you recommend any offline crypto events in london
335841,i guess a better way to frame it is im wondering if there are other mechanisms besides full backing and seignioragei also probably need to get more precise on what seigniorage does exactlymy rough understanding is if above peg buy and burn the seigniorage token if under peg mint and sell seigniorage token seems about rightdoes that really just work dont these protocols use other tricks to stabilize the peg
335842,look at fei i guess
335843,except that it doesnt work
335844,it certainly doesnt just work we have seen too many failed algoundercollateralized stables for that if it works at all it needs to be bootstrapped and maintained very carefully
335845,fair point what are the seigniorage coins currently ustluna frax partially
335846,pretty much i am sure there are a bunch of others but without meaningful volumeusage they all seem to work the problems usually first show under pressure
335847,went back to dig this which is relevant
335848,my understanding is that fei is the other model ie fully collateralized by ethrelevant reading here is
335849,yes but theres a mechanism regarding how the protocol reacts when its undercollateralizedwhich raises a question as to does it need 100 maybe can achieve the same with 50 cr maybe less iunno
335850,yes jcny hardpegged to usdc on polygon
335851,dont you just liquidate the undercollateralized minters if that happensi was imagining that this worked a bit like a 0cost loan protocol deposit collateral get fei but maintain the minimum collateralization ratio or get liquidated
335852,hard pegged with usdc collateral right
335853,not to usdc
335855,exactly exchanged to cl oracle
335856,frax and ust are not segniorage coinsthe one is a fractional reserve stablecoin the other is a overcollaterlized
335857,we have 3 types of stable coins right
335858,cryptocollateral stable centralized stable algo stable
335859,and fractional that is kind of cryptocollateral algo in one
335860,which is in my opinion the only way how to scale an algo one
335861,hmm yesbacked stablesynthetic stable with full collateral algorithmic mixed
335862,we have the trilemma too decentralized price stability capital efficiency
335863,so whats seigniorage then posted my understanding of it above mintsell buyburn
335864,also to push back a bit i think theres many ways that we could potentially do algorithmic stablecoins
335865,how about the price stability of it
335866,well unless fei mechanics have changed the collateralization is on the entire stablecoin reserve and not per minterthe dynamics are such that the protocol is less eager to buy at shitty prices so if price goes below 1 the protocol will buy at a really bad rate but on the other hand will mint at a great rate other way around when price is above 1 afaik
335867,amazing i guess other aggregators can use that as well
335868,where is the message you replying to seems deleted missing context which city is this about
335869,have we though the many are almost exclusively we are better ampl copypastas with tweaks that have a time horizon of 2 weeks
335870,it depends is it collaterlizedis it not collaterlizedis it partially collaterlizedi guess thats the categories to define segniorage how the normal crypto world sees itis kind of none collaterlized fully algorithmically backedfor example ampleforth ohm are also segniorage stablecoins with no backing
335871,talking about algo stables read this
335872,this is a really dubious thread if you get more tokens when its below peg why wont it remain persistently under peg
335873,thats for all intents and purposes the reason nubits fell apart at least he calls conjecture
335874,hi what marketing channel good for titano fork
335875,anyone got the best place to read about upcoming gamefi aaa style aaa is rare in crypto
335876,1 hr left to enter
335877,enter what
335878,defi olympiads see the thread i replied to
335879,do you know of any aaa title
335880,illuvium
335881,ninja would be second to minde
335882,the results could be very tragic and i do not intend to be involved
335883,how do you mean
335886,
335887,you know they are real devs when they understand this hustle finally someone took the time and solved it
335888,what is the current supply of stg
335889,dexscreener shows diffrent for each chain
335896,ivangbi were going to court or ill just complain about them to my mom
335897,lmao what a ripoff well not ripoff just a funny coincidence pretty scammy anyway with just a random pf w already promising a random shitcoin nothing to see but good catch d
335899,ser including a main tweet thread to each one of the topics would make it much better for readers to go and explore each one in context but overall needs muuuuch more work to be on par w what some guys like jon danger etc product good luck theodelarosa
335900,ser you already made a convo about auditors their rates and decent names before i am not seeing how this question is simply not a repetition
335901,the replies were around here and you can try to ctrlf earlier in history for similar keywords rj
335902,this is solana there are more fresh fry than in the ocean everyone willing to pay for shit in the air
335903,thank you i appreciate constructive feedback
335907,portion of your daily cringe
335908,its engagement farming dismiss it in the same way how the defiant was ignored by line goes up guy to discuss some points im sure the only purpose of this is to drive clicks and ad revenue dont circulate it further dismiss it
335909,of course just a guilty pleasure for me
335910,yeah if it was done to promote discussion then it could be valuable but right from the outset you can tell by the title they just want clicks
335911,everyone has their guilty pleasures
335912,hi everyone do you guys know why tether doesnt issue usdt on fantom yet i only see fusdt frapped version only
335913,
335914,fun story
335915,they might not think it has enough tvl they might not be personally connected to even discuss this they might have not gotten a good deal after discussing etc etc nobody but the teams on both sides would be able to tell you
335916,
335917,from the whitehat
335918,in practice it is worse than this malicious validation library and relayer deployed by same address and unverified can rug even with an honest oracle the only check that is made outside the unverified validation is that there is enough confirmations so if stargate team attacks they can practically use any block with enough confirmations and simply ignore the content
335919,
335920,
335921,
335922,zefram going quite ape nuts on stg oef
335923,but ser numba goes up
335924,their independent entities assumption tries to punch above its weight class the response im seeing from them so far shifts that risk onto protocols by pointing out that they get to pick and manage the relayer and oracle themselves but that doesnt fix the trustless problem just changes who gets the finger pointed at them if something goes wrong
335925,basically they marketed their protocol by claiming to have solved a problem they didnt really solve but just shifted around reminds me of l1s rule of thumb is that if vitalik claims there is a hard problem somewhere scaling cross chain bridges then its worth to double check any solution that comes up
335926,isnt it the case for any dapp relying on an oracle whole defi sphere i am not an expert but trying to understand
335927,their assumption was that as long as you have this other guy the relayer you are safer from oracle issues because he can just stop relaying the messages but in their implementation the validation logic is unverified and the team can update the validation logic for their bridge if they want in essence they can say fuck you to the oracle and just rug lps no matter what the oracle says
335928,ah okay so it is not like a hacker can exploit the protocol but team relayer can rug by coordinating
335929,not directly exploitable from outsiders if the unverified contracts are safe but yes if the team and relayer coordinate they can rug or if the relayer deployed malicious unverified code for the validation he can rug by himself there are two code examples showcasing these cases if you look in the thread
335930,reminder bzx was hacked by getting hold of private keys
335931,i guess truly trustless dapp would be one that is not hackable by any bugs in the contract or imported ones ownership is fully renounced and it is running in a blockchain that is the most decentralised there has been a lot of discussion on how to define decentralised blockchain but not so much on what is truly fully trustless system
335932,john have some definitions in this thread for trustlessness believe he also have some presentations were he elaborate more a good starting point i think with more in the paper
335933,is there a faucet that drops native tokens for other chains for new addresses for example i generate a new account with ledger on polygon and i want to drop some matic on it but without kyc ideally this service would have support for other chains as well and i could seed that account with funds for a few transactions on each networki would be interested in building something like this if anyone finds it useful and there are no similar products available now for example this way you could onboard users directly to l2
335934,problem with dexible sell strategy
335935,nan
335936,do you mean something like this i need to refill some walletsthe most difficult task on this kind of faucet is to avoid people creating multiple addresses and claiming since these are mainnet tokens a few cents per request are enough incentive for people in some countries to think about how to pass all the checks you make
335937,anyone know of a coindesk or consensus telegram or discord cant find anywhere to meet other attendees
335938,yeah something like this but it should not be free to use as you say that invites spammers but a simple fee that is paid to the service provider for the tokens should cover the costs
335939,you can also bridge with synapse to a chain and theyll send enough for a swap
335940,thanks synapse is probably the closest to what i imagine the only thing is that it ties your identity between chains to the same address
335941,poorly set sell order
335943,anyone want to give feedback on my latest article or any debates on the future of workplace infrastructure
335944,
335945,nice selling 12b ust for 12b usdt
335946,i think its smart although usdt doesnt get any love in the space still important pillar of the stable coins game hopefully the space gets more decentralized in this way rather than more sillod
335947,adam hates shitcoins
335948,wealth transfer
335950,it affects his business
335952,the whole point of bitcoin is to advance a system that doesnt give any one person advantages over the system
335953,competition
335955,shitcoins are just one guy minting all the coins and selling them to you
335956,its just like the old fiat system
335957,adam is a bitcoiner
335961,is there a list of lobsters looking for freelance work anywhere

335986,true i like the fact that i can swap my collateral without repaying my loan first
335991,adam is the ceo of blockstream their main product is a bitcoin l2 liquid that gives advantage to certain people and is literally a l2 for shitcoins
335992,adam invests hell even leads investments for shitcoins he is a virtue signaller running purity tests to which he doesnt conform but yeh he a bitcoiner kek
335993,do as i say not as i do
335995,seeking large brain helptax software is saying that i swapped lithium for amweththe summary at the top of the screenshot is saying that i swapped lithium for matici dont remember but i have a hard time believing that i swapped a farmed token for an aave deposited wetham i missing something here

336012,quite an interesting thread on everything that went wrong with solidly
336013,can someone eli5 the benefit if any of the merge on an l2
336014,farm42 i hope youre r doing well ser
336015,err is that the old ui haha
336017,well try to explore the world of theunfettered
336019,paks 2nd ash drop was such a disaster 11m in gas fees burned
336020,nan
336021,link please
336023,
336024,this is the contract unfortunately i was one of the victims
336025,nan
336026,nan
336027,seems like they have a plan for compensationprops to them for taking that up to the chin
336028,i have just seen 1inch road ad in dubai not sure its worth it difficult to test as well
336029,good share although the part about the new x3y y3x invariant is misleadingx3yy3x isnt really suited for very correlated assets like usdc usdt dai somewhat good for usdcmim pair but still not good enough it shines though for correlated assets like solid solidsex oxsolid allowing a good price discoverythe reasoning is that the price incurred by the pool imbalance goes stonks quite fast not at fast as univ2 pool but much faster than a curve pool with any reasonable a so the pool needs deep liquidity to facilitate mediumsized trades not as capital efficient as it could have been
336030,its all about the tradeoffs innit
336031,do you know who are the lps on uni v3
336032,interesting twist in the cbdc verse us been skeptical the past 2 years not sure how this doesnt qualify as a cbdc though
336033,is there a way to check if a contract address is legit ie does not have any hidden scam factors
336035,depends the chain rugcheck for bsc someone posted a tool on twitter a while ago but it couldnt check rugs over several blocks forgot the account
336036,
336037,lol its actually quite crazy how irresponsible both their launch and calling themselves trustless is where bridges like hop and connext take months to battletest their bridges slowly they just rushed a token out of the gate why
336038,please ser moneys gonna be made in the end its the token price that matters not the underlying tech s
336039,how does normal project perform their vesting allocation is this by manual good faith or lock behind some smart contract mechanismim looking at sand right now and there seems to be some discrepancy between vested and current balance in the addressexample for advisor there supposed to be 225m unvested yet the contract address left 144m
336040,in general vesting contracts which are auditable or a third party service such as unicrypt to lock up tokens for fixed periods will be used but a lot of teams will play cautiously and leave things unlocked should they need to adapt to changing needs ie their original assumptions change market dynamics change
336041,i see i guess it provides more flexibility to the company but how would they ensure to investors with regards to their vesting scheduleit becomes difficult to keep track of the actual circulating supply
336042,its an illusion teams can and often do change things
336043,extra supply because of a new exciting listing to introduce farmingstaking where it wasnt ever part of the roadmap to stay current and say theyre now defi delays because theyre behind roadmap and dont want seed investors to dump etc etc etc
336044,only ethos matters the rest can be gamed as blockminded says above
336045,ser if they really wanna b malicious they can just leave ala hanging and relaunch as a new forked product but bugfree under new anon handles this time
336046,so i have been putting too much faith in coingecko circulating supply data o
336049,yes thats most of the time not accurate and even if its accurate at the time you need to manually look into how the tokens are vested circulating supply market cap and fdv are useless metrics if not put into context further investigated
336050,perpetual futures introduce a further problem with vested tokens if the vested parties have capital they can simply short their vested amounts on perps as hedge until their actual unlock happens
336051,coingecko is accurate at the point the data is first published from the disclosures teams provide if no such disclosure is made the circulating supply figures are inaccurate andor estimated and they are seldom updated when stages of a project lifecycle are met and supply is diluted circulating supply is subjective and different products such as cmc and gecko have their own ways of establishing the supply numbers all based on honesty of the underlying team
336052,yes agreed i think its going to get very exciting to get a fully functioning solidly type amm the key question is weather noobs on bsc will understand how this work
336055,hello good lobsters does anyone know of a python equivalent for bignumberjs
336056,decimal
336057,the key question is wether devs who build it understand how it workswould be a first or
336058,check out mpmath library
336059,im using decimal perhaps the getcontextprec 17 is not enough precision
336060,thanks will do
336061,you can set any precision default is 28 if i remember correctly
336062,rounding option is controllable btw
336063,thanks
336064,paradigm is right
336065,is wallet connect enabled
336066,i cant seem to find it
336067,connect select a wallet show more walletconnect should be working let me know if not and well get on it
336068,why is he saying roosh guy who made solidly fail is broke
336069,lol hes def not broke but afaik he bought 7 figures of solid when ti was 10 to get big nfts
336070,reckon it has been timed
336071,nan
336072,
336073,500m exploit
336075,oh crap damn wow
336076,holy fucking shit christ wow
336077,oh no
336078,well these past two up only days were fun thanks guys
336079,holy cow
336080,hacker gained control of 5 out of the 9 validators
336081,got a link to the info thats wild
336082,
336083,decentralized kek
336084,transparency is so important
336085,this wallet controls the stolen funds
336087,are the axies nfts safe
336088,id think they are not so stupid
336089,please tell me they didnt fund their account from binance
336090,as only way to sell axie is via ronin
336091,lmao
336092,lol yeah binance but i assume they could have bought a donor account
336093,actually it seems like they gained control over 4 validators and tricked the fifth one into signing by using some deprecated apitheir article does a fairly good job describing the 5th validator but they limit info about the first four to managed to get control over sky maviss four ronin validators and attacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawalsa bit sus
336094,is that the sky mavis address that was in allowlist
336095,uh how did this exploit go unnoticed for 6 days
336096,yeah super weird its like there is no monitoring on funds
336097,why would you hack a bridge nobody notices it but then you still dont transfer out the funds
336098,this is weird
336099,hello jump trading about our bridge
336100,
336101,so which protocol has it operations engineer
336102,i mean u can buy kyc for 50 on darknet
336103,thats also true or use someones pc with a full access to browser and thus binance ie donor persona as in examplewwwbleepingcomputercomnewssecurityhackersstealfromhackersbypushingfakemalwareonforums
336104,but cashing out on cex is not a way
336105,sure but ftx wont let him trade nor cash out
336106,tornado cash
336107,also this does not require kyc and uses same wallets as binance
336108,they didnt notice that one eoa withdrew all the eth in the bridge in 1 transaction
336109,yeap whole behavior is pretty weird on this hack
336110,will be interesting to see how it unfolds
336111,no multi sig required on centralized validators what could go wrong
336112,
336113,is this front end built by the core team or is this a larp
336114,balancers new ui is terrible too
336115,oops saylor just bought btc right
336116,its not defi season its we didnt hire a new front end team season
336117,do finishing saylor leveraging
336118,its being built by the core team
336119,
336120,make msdos great again
336121,nice to see some solidarity in this space at last
336122,plz dont go we want everything to be as flat as possible and look like every other website design route
336123,did wormhole ever got back the hacked eth btw
336124,more amazed that no one noticed it for 6 days than about the sum
336125,same here
336126,one guy did and got liquidated with his short
336127,guys recently someone shared here a good resource of best options to stake stable coins for good yields i am trying to find that message can someone help with the keyword to get the message
336128,how the hack is found siiiiix days later
336129,looks a lot like convex
336130,
336132,coindix perhaps
336133,
336135,nan
336136,
336137,roflmao the exact same date as the hack
336138,isnt stealtheximo a scam site would be funny to doublescam
336139,fpis is not released yet
336140,io not a scam yet
336141,sam had a talk with defriday last week he said fpis will coming in next 12 weeks
336142,its more to check to see if your wallet will be receiving any
336144,on the contrary the last up only period really started after the poly hack
336145,maybe its a sign
336146,are withdrawals halted on ronin
336147,1 validator went offline and since then 0 withdrawals processed
336148,nan
336149,btw the quorum upgrade from 5 to 8 was executed 12 hours ago from the axie deployer eoa
336150,who can explain this
336151,so is antagonistic voting good but not for the reason designed
336152,
336153,8of9 requirement is terrible for liveness
336154,yeah thats why my question if its halted on purpose or if its because that validator went offline
336155,
336156,is it me or are these hacks getting moreworse
336157,bigger pool more fish i guess
336158,more levels of complexity in newer protocols as well its easier to reason why uniswap or compound wont be hacked versus some bridge with gateways across 10 chains and massive multisig risk
336159,is usdc on polygon native or wrapped
336160,did solidly change vote bribing capabilities wrt curve or is the problem just who holds the ve tokens
336162,
336164,
336167,hello sers we have wrote a thread on blockchain scalability
336168,this even tops the wormhole hack they forgot to mention the money he stole from the validators themselves in addition to the bridge an additional 8500eth
336169,anyone having issues with metamask ledger metamask cant seem to connect
336172,yep always
336173,try framesh
336174,thanks frame works
336175,more complexity more surface area
336176,just wrote about this its only gonna keep getting worse honest majority assumption bridges are a huge security hole
336177,its possible the fca could extend its deadline but some crypto companies have already started moving operations to other nearby european destinations like croatia and switzerland emilyjnicolle and ivanlevingston detail some of the companies moves tribal72qkwvk
336179,
336180,so is anyone asking how many multisigs secures terras btc reserves
336181,probably just do but dont worry its not game theory optimal for him to steal it
336184,everyone hopefully uses the llama airforce union for a struggle free bribe gathering experience
336185,are there any good writeups on cold walletseed backup strategies location sharding medium etc
336186,
336187,
336188,imagine trying to take the moral high ground while holding an alleged critical bug as ransom because you dont think youre getting paid enough
336189,didnt realize that was morally acceptable ill keep it in mind the next time i feel like im not getting paid enough
336190,morality is a moving target i suppose
336191,maybe it was the kyc
336192,doesnt sound like it but im happy to be proven wrong
336193,if their current bug is anything like their last bug though idk
336194,this sounds like i can make a nft that emits fake transfer events and spoof the sender to make it look like famous people are using my nft
336195,that has been around for ages in the mint function scam projects mint to influencer wallets and it shows up on open sea as if the influencer minted the project himself opensea only checks if the transfer event comes from zero address and displays famous wallet minted projecta
336196,i know a ton of newbies that have fallen for this because of the fomo
336197,remember uniswap purchase spoofs same story
336199,
336200,as far as i understand in solidly youre basically bribed against a promise to vote for x but you can change your vote to where your bag is last minute while votium is snapshot based so its kind of broken yes protocols dont use it
336201,still interested in seeing people freestyle on top of the solidly model like enso on avax
336202,it was twitter thread
336203,
336204,googlely
336205,is enso changing anything interesting when live
336207,another thing to note is that all trading fees from pairs are automatically converted into solidly bribes for the pairs gauge so the initial assumption of more fees pair is producing more voters are incentivized to vote for it doesnt really hold
336211,for the bribe issue one solution is to lock votes in for x days
336212,that should work assuming 35 x 7 i think lower x makes more sense but you cant make it lower than half an epoch though
336213,hi
336214,currently i am in the process of querying wellwritten documentation of postmortem bridge saas hacks like axs ronin roninhack event think sc auditingif u can provide links and resources then u will be a homie thanks
336215,should be 7 days or voters can still switch vote before snapshot no
336216,more trading fees more pseudobribe more incentive to vote for gauge i dont see how this doesnt hold
336217,werent there supposed to be a fix for this vfat0 snapshot page you mentioned
336218,hey guys not trying to throw shade or blame axie but does anyone know how or why exactly it took ronin over 6 days to notice 100000 eth was moved out were the funds spread across many addressesplaces so it was hard to visually track i dont understand how its possible to not notice if it was all in 1 address anyone have the backstory why it took a week
336219,maybe they thought they cod retrieve the funds before it became a public problem
336220,iirc they adjusted the 89 etc just about 10 hours before their medium
336221,my bet complacencyall was working well for long enough they trusted its perfectly fine and didnt place any monitoring tools
336222,so dont think it was them trying to solvage the situation
336223,what would reaction to the hack once notified ronin is closed source from what i gather
336224,i think it also makes a statement about their userbase level of adoption usually users would notice something like that immediately
336225,seems weird to have 100000 eth and not have any monitoring on it or not even periodically just stare at it to make sure it still exists i was just wondering if it was really that obvious and it was all in 1 address or it was more complex to monitor
336226,ya it seems odd
336227,just 1 tx moving it out
336228,and then keep milking it for a week
336229,has to have been an attempted cover up job dont announce until we know whats going on and be sure were actually rekt sort of thing
336230,do you have the tx i only see a series of tx from the address on etherscan but cant figure out if ultimate source of eth was 1 address
336231,i guess well know the truth as time goes on
336232,
336233,wow thats so casuali have a really hard time believing no one noticed something like that for a week
336234,rektnews
336235,good one
336240,withdrawerc20foruint256 _withdrawalid address _user address _token uint256 _amount bytes _signatures
336241,does anyone have any idea how the saas implementation of ronin communicating with multisigs works i actually know nothing about it does it have one
336242,there was a twit that someone notticed and thought that team was rugging and got blocked on their discord
336243,
336244,nah this message of that anon was rly fucking weird idk how anyone uses it as justification to you were warned if i ever received it would have probably thought its some lunatic spammer asking for money the persopn could have clearly said hey bridge tx look
336245,you operate a defi protocol you receive messages like this all the time
336246,on the other hand another interesting question is whether projects using these bridges have any monitoring systems in placelets say multichain is exploited how long until the teams that utilize it to bridge their assets to other ledgers find out
336247,is it a merchi about alexs tshirt
336248,assumptions are prob that chains are running like normal
336249,wouldnt you at least glance at your wallets ballance it would add extra second to banning lunatic and moving on with your life
336250,alexpgc21 ser is mine was mine no ron aalex printed himself
336251,is anyone here active in vulnerability researchis there a reliable service that does a third party judge of severity of a bugexploiteg they independently determine if the bounty is worth 25k or 75kor a reliable bug bounty escrow that can hold money and release it once the exploit poc is shown
336252,feel free to dm i am active in this area
336253,i am interested in this as well i think theres plent of bounties axs had on few websites that pay for that and i mainly remember them paying front end stuff which i guess is common
336254,idk what that last question refers to tho
336255,bug bounties are extremely common im talking about third party services in support of the bounty finders
336256,sort of like a company putting equity into the bounty finders for the betterment of dlt space im not sure
336257,there should be one
336258,wanted to get lobster help sop speaking of covered up a bit more less obvious programs which are not really lm but still give potentially a good incentive wdyt of these howd u structure anything similar
336259,code4rena
336260,wdym alex got the keys to the wallet with 110 lobs
336261,what up
336262,1 2 sounds like a poap that acts as a wl qualifierregarding 3 maybe take a look at how gro protocols gro4all airdrop was conducted the longer you participated in the protocol in the early days the more of an airdrop you received4 consider a lockdrop mechanism where users that lock liquidity for longerdurations receive a larger sized airdrop delphi digital worked on a lockdrop lbp mechanism for astroport bastion protocol recently adopted this model but removed the lbp part also see their lockdrop faq
336263,q would anyone know what litecoin based solutions do is referring to do kwon mentions in an interview that they are evaluating trust minimize bridges for btc ust swap in this case litecoin based solutions and not wrapped btc unchained by laura shin
336265,thank you this is very useful ser
336266,
336267,it doesnt hold because the bribes are being distributed throughout the week voters especially the big ones like 0xdao not sure if solidlysex does that are optimising their voting process by allocating votes to highest yielding pairs and then change it closer to epochs endso in fact the amount of fees generated by a pair and amount of votes its gauge receives at snapshot is not correlated
336268,yeah making it 45 days is also awkward what if you could only vote once per epoch insteadthis is a fairly easy fix to implement in forks though and it should make the inhouse bribing work as intended
336269,yes voting once per epoch 7 days period would fix all the above or no streaming of bribe
336270,were gonna set up a proposal for funding eth devs soon
336271,via curve dao and convex dao voted into a specialised vefunder gauge
336272,
336273,one of my goals is to promote gauges that go beyond liquidity mining we recently successfully funded vyperlang development which makes us the first dao to fund a public good with token inflation
336279,does anyone know wtf this address is it randomly sent me eth yesterday
336280,
336281,send it back or a dao will come after you
336282,im so confused lol
336284,should i not touch it
336285,this looks like egl
336286,
336287,ooh
336288,sweet i forgot about that
336289,how did you figure out btw igor i need those skills i tried google and twitter but no luck on the address
336290,i checked tx history
336291,he checked the chain
336292,did you find it
336293,what is the benefit of sending that eth straight to exchanges even if they are stolen kyc
336295,break the scoringaml system probably and make it to highlight false positives but i havent figured out how exactly yet
336296,6 days and nobody notices 625m has been siphoned outmaybe he was looking for attention
336297,
336298,this is worse
336299,had what turned out to be almost a week to tornado everything and not worry about money for the next century but did nothing dude was probably expecting a bargain message within the hour
336300,fyi everyone arrakis spin off passed with majority voting with the communityled proposal
336301,
336302,hey lobsters might be a bit offtopic but hosting an afterparty on 18th of april to close of the first day of eth amsterdamdevconnect drinks will be free bring your langoustines and have some fun apply via the form on the link
336303,and ivan if you dont ban you can come as well kek
336304,u r a lobster u r allowed this cool
336305,
336306,i wouldnt call it community led the community begged to not be diluted from 4 to 12 the team mercifully agreed to 3 after repeatedly attacking anyone who disagreed the community took it because the gelato team basically said the project would fail otherwise
336307,stg is up for grabs again for those who pre approved and bonded
336310,hey i just posted an article on usts mechanism and the btc reservelet me know what you think
336311,
336312,is the golden age of retail being able to invest in cool projects early over they just raised at a 1b cap
336313,alabema bought whole round at 025
336314,that was 250m fdv right
336316,nah you still can just private market over valuations
336317,but it was stargate not layerzero
336318,i like the executive summary and decent explanation of some pretty confusing things it feels like ust is in a black hole and this btc buy is their attempt to hit escape velocity please keep writing i like how well you justify all of your points
336319,thanks yeah i think they are in an interesting situation if they make it work somehow i feel like they would be kind of pushing the envellope of stablecoinsmoney farther than anybody else in the spaceat the same time theyre really hanging by a thread if any serious market crisis happens
336320,stargate is not lz ser
336323,what is lz actually offering if protocols pick both their own oracle and relayer in their model
336324,just the token pamp and potential fee revenue from the hidden fees
336325,wow havent heard this before
336326,one small step for man resulting in him flailing awkwardly because the holes in the bridge would make a city of potholes jealous
336327,ill believe it when i see it too many bridge protocols are utter fucking garbage and become the defi flavor of the month
336328,hello guys are u in seems like good opportunity for lobster holders
336329,
336330,equity i guess
336332,is the voting bribing all onchain in solidy or which part use eg snapshot
336333,hermes solidly implemented on metis changed that so your vote is locked for 1 week from the moment u voted so as to prevent last minute shenanigans such as described here
336334,is that like curve then or why how did they make it different
336335,free mint so no reason not to gas is pretty cheap atm
336336,dont know cuz i never did curve but thats how it is on hermes seems to prevent that gaming of the voting system so probably a better way than on solidly itself
336337,yes they say that the mint will last 3 days but for some reason i think that will close sooner
336340,are you in business buddy
336341,yes sir sure
336342,good shilling i give you the highest score
336343,good news
336344,does anyone know any good otc rooms
336345,i was looking for some help in auditing a smart contract or a bot that people have made to do a quick look at a smart contract i have been seeing people use a tg bot that checks for honeypots and such is something available for a novice to have some loosely made confidenceis this a dumb question sorry

336350,thank you this is perfect
336352,i thought this whole blockchain movement started because of the exasperation at the financial system during the 2008 crisisnow bitcoin is being bought up and held by a centralised company in order to backstop bank runs to an unbacked stablecoin kept afloat by market faithdemandliquidity aloneweve come full circle and its depressingworse still is watching maxiish bitcoiners celebrate this while calling everything else shitcoins

336393,guess he means terra liquidating all their btc at once would result in a btc price that would make the immanent cost structure of the crypto industry unsustainable imo thats not the case
336394,
336395,lapsus and solarwinds hackers both use the same old trick to bypass mfaarticle comments
336396,about the very end of acs ve33 blog1 how does ve being nfts address fix a the capital inefficiency problem of ve assets what problemb the concern over future liquidity why the concern2 please explain the rationale of decreasing emissions with increased lockers ie when 50 is locked emissions drops to 50
336397,does someone here know the answer to thisdoes opensea use erc165 supportedinterface to detect nfts or do they detect based on combination of function calls events emitted by contracts generallyis this public knowledge
336399,edit
336401,not true
336409,
336410,got some usdc dust swiped by someone today and found this revoke if you interacted with basketdao back in the day
336411,these claim transactions are interacting with the exploirer address right
336412,not really those are simply fake transfer eventsit happens very often with wallets owned by venture capitals or celebrities like vb ac less experienced traders would assume those celebrities interact with the contracts and hold such tokens
336413,i see good to know
336414,for point 2 the goal is to incentive people to lock as the more lock the less farming emission and so less dilution on paper it makes sense and the anti dilution mechanism is needed to incentivize people to lock
336415,
336417,fair competition imo
336441,what happens when compound forks utilization rates go to 9999 how is it supposed to unwind will the rates just eat up the borrowers collateral but since its all borrowed how is anyon supposed to get any funds back
336442,what is this
336443,correct borrow apr would skyroket until either 1 borrower return loans 2 their get liquidated because of insance apr 3 people would deposit more because of greate apr on deposits
336444,its minimum 100bn more than eth in 2 years lotta room to grow
336446,imho i dont see it not on the app nor on the landing page 1 no team 2 no addresses of contracts to verify that its not a honeypot 3 not even github so redflaggish af i dont say its the case but it certainly might looks like 250 apr on bitcoineth with 99 utilization excuse which i couldnt verify it because of no simple way to check contracts might be greeddriving scamhoneypot i dont see any reasonable blocker why dont address that 3 points
336447,contracts are findable and they have 110mil across a few chainsits even supported by the official fuse team so no i dont think its a honeypot
336448,nan
336450,lending on apeswap and spiritswap established projects point to ola same as oolongswap on boba unlikely to be a honeypot
336451,its defintely some sort of hack or oracle attack
336452,
336454,anyone have a contact at circleusdc 400k usdc still in the attackers wallet
336455,seems unlikely to be an exploit compound forks normally are safe
336456,clearly an exploit
336457,its def an exploit address was funded with 1 eth from tornado
336458,famous last words
336459,hasnt just about every moderately relevant compound fork been exploited in one way or another
336460,_
336461,looks like he created a contract that allowed him to mint the collateral asset receipt tokens
336462,i wouldnt be surprised
336463,hi the price of banana is a twap that is being taken from their dex
336464,you can read more about it in our gitbook
336465,we are aware there was a hack on the ola lending network on fuse we have already taken action to freeze bridge transaction and are working with legal and technical authorities and experts in order to bring more details into this exploit and next steps we will be giving more info over the next few hours with up to date information as it is available
336466,he made a strange trade instead of selling the fuse for eth he took a high slippage trade and bought ichis onefusethen swapped the onefuse out for usdcwhy would you not take the eth very strange
336467,even stranger is that hes holding a freezable fiatcoin
336468,yeah 13 mill across eth and bsc bad hacker
336469,nope sir lost it
336471,sers does anyone remember which part of layer zero uses a multisig or is it stargate
336472,i also heard there is a stargate whitepaper floating around would appreciate a link if anyone has it
336473,if anyone from the eu please vote against this shit
336474,that was quick
336475,any idea why ve should be nfts
336476,the principal difference from curve is that theyre transferrable which kind of undermines resistance against governance attacks so the reasoning behind this is not entirely clear
336477,can you elaborate on the 2 reasons ac gave in point 1 a b
336478,i dont know his exact reasoning but i suppose it could be this vecrv cannot be moved for possibly long periods of time so this means that the more users lock which the entire ecosystem highly incentivizes the less liquid crv becomes as a result there are multiple reasons why low crv liquidity would be bad
336479,anyone here from defi safety
336480,river0x
336481,do ve tokens disappear at end of the lock period in curve solidly
336482,you can burn your vecrv to get the locked crv back after the lock ends not sure about solidly
336483,so are transferable ve preferred overall in your opinion the gov attack seems part of the value of accumulating ve has it been a problem in solidly do you think it would be
336484,do we see any volume for trading venft where can that be done need to use an nft marketplace
336485,i prefer nontransferrable accumulating ve to attack the protocol is harmful nonorganic demand so i wouldnt include it into the value of ve calculation
336486,
336487,but you can accumulate ve just by buying non locked tokens locking them for ve anyhow does restricting locked ve transfer really help much against gov attackmaybe ac made ve transferable so he can sell his venft bags one day
336488,nontransferability will lead to centralization curve is controlled by convex because people actually get a liquid vecrv so in fact a governance attack isnt easier to happen but it already won
336489,do you also feel the same way about steth and lido when i compare vecrv to staked eth in validators people usually start to understand the elegance of the vetoken system the entire point is that it is nontransferrable and another entity which isnt the actual protocol must hypothecate its derivative just like steth and eth in lido
336490,
336491,what does convex return again also a ve nft if not please compare soliditys nft vs convexs returned tokens
336492,partially while i personally think eth has less governance impact on the eth chain itself it still leads to centralizationwhile steth actually stands for eth rewards aka a added bonus the system tends to work better as cvxcrv is nothing but a farm token steth has somewhat a value backing it nonetheless the staked eth is controlled by lido which is controlled by its governance token where almost all votes are privateseed teamso ye centralized in itself nonetheless not exactly the same model imo
336493,its happening element deployer is minting and setting up vesting packages with elfi tokens
336494,the main conceptual parts are the same between the two because the point is that if the vetoken was transferrable it would defeat the entire point of the system the same way that if staked eth was wrapped and transferrable on the protocol level it would remove all security guaranteesslashing of block producers
336495,this is the token btw
336496,nan
336497,elves smurfs
336498,thats not true you are thinking of gnswith gmx glp the liquidity pool token holders are the counterparty to tradesthere are both studies showing that long term cumulative pnl for traders trends to be negative as well as the gns and gmx platform data which have both been running for over a year that show that trader pnl is negative
336499,its possibly a in security but nonetheless its centralization a bank is also more safe then money in your own pockets but imo its not the way you want to gonontransferability is good until you get a convex layer on top then the venft imo is the more elegant solutionbecause if lidocvx want to do something for their own benefit they could do basically anytime theres 0 protection because they already won the governance attackon the nfts you still have every user being able to be a part while obviously the 51 attack can happen with enough money but same could be said about the liquid coin risk doesnt really increase to a fully unlocked governance token
336500,not sure if the nfts are the optimal solution but they are the defi attempt while the other attempt is relying on 1 entity to be trustful
336501,why does it have to be an nft does convex also return an nft why cant it be a normal token
336502,because its a locked token that isnt sellable on the normal marketthe nft just gives you somewhat liquidity to transfer but still no access to the open market
336503,why not allow easier open market liquidity for eg the anti centralization reason you mentioned whats the downside of open market
336504,if you have luna staked with galactic punks you should immediately go and redelegate do not unstake gp has lost access to their validator and now user funds will also slowly get slashed if you dont have a preferred validator feel free to stake with us danku_zone w daic
336505,i think you are missing the point im making entirely i agree with you that having a single entity being a monopoly on the derivative issuance layer is bad but what i am pointing out is that if the protocol itself is the one that allows staked tokens to be wrapped and transferrable whether nfts or just erc20 tokens it is entirely selfdefeating it is as pointless as if ethereum issued a wrapped erc20 token representing staked eth in validators that would defeat the entire point of staking the eth in the validator in the first place
336506,any spotify cryprocurrency podcast recommendation thanks
336507,very cool could i get a link to the studies you are talking about cheers
336508,but doesnt the 3rd party adding a transferable token result in the same meaninglessness by that logic or how not
336511,does anyone have an idea on what happened to solana supporting move vm why did they stop supporting it
336512,no it does not because for example lido still has to care about its behavior otherwise the eth backing its steth gets slashed same thing with convex the vecrv and vefxs that it holds will depreciate in value if they destroy the protocols that they hold staked tokens in contrast this with the alternative being proposed where the protocol itself will give a transferrable token representing the staked asset to the end user who can then just vote or produce blocks with the token then dump it instantaneously in the same block and you can see why it is a selfdefeating feature
336513,the whole point of ve from the standpoint of governance attack protection is that the attacker has to commit to a position that is correlated with protocol success they will have to lose money in order to attackwith transferrable ve they can lock a bunch of solid perform an attack and then sell the nft if liquidity allows itwhile convex has a lot of vecrv attacking curve would destroy convex as well since their entire incentive structure is dependent on crv
336514,could you slash them if they own 51 of the votes
336515,no because that is by definition the canonical majority but that is a useless question since it is irrelevant if they owned 51 of your wrapped nfts or wrapped staked erc20 tokens it would be the same thing
336516,hmm am looking here is one on day traders so not necessarily leverage
336517,but thats where the model leads to if the original one is illiquid though so in fact they can do whatever they want
336518,venfts are pretty much not sellable aside from some otc or whateverthe real important part is when it comes to utilization borrowing against it etc
336519,you dont need to create a governance token and make it lockable without transfer if 1 entity owns the voterights for anything anyways due to that fact at some pointthats what i mean you indirectly ruin your own ideaare venfts better maybe or maybe not but they try to fix this issue finding a balance
336520,
336521,which again leads us to normal people dont care for governance and therefore normal people governance does not work d
336522,not really i already explained that i agree with you that a monopoly on one entity controlling most of the staked asset should be avoided obviously the entire point is to make sure that a vibrant economy of entities form that hypothecate the derivative of the staked nontransferrable token just like how we hope that will be the case for staked eth and it wont be a single man show with lido
336523,i agree if theres multiple entities fighting good for the ecosystembut you also risk to ruin your governance aka crv with convex
336524,the way to fight a monopoly is not to wrap the staked asset on the protocol layer and thus completely ruin the economic system the way to solve it is to foster a vibrant decentralized distribution of the staked asset you are basically arguing eth should issue a wrapped version of its staked eth so that lido cannot capture 51 of the staked eth that is a terrible idea because issuing liquid staked eth completely destroys the security guarantees of pos
336525,one entity holding all the tokens is not necessarily bad it depends on the control structure of that entity nobody generally objects to daos holding 50 of their token in their treasury to spend as they see fit as long as its not faux governance ala time and cvx ownership is fairly welldistributed
336526,is the whole votebadanddumpfast attack really a problem in reality market can react to bad votes we have to weigh this versus a centralized entity like convex controlling curve
336527,a wrapped staked eth and a venft is not really the sameone is liquid and the other is not really but ye the whole models are not completly matured yet imo and we will see how it ends
336528,its not bad for the performance and maybe eco but it has not much to do with defi or a proper governance structure
336529,just recently justin sun borrowed a load of comp to add tusd as collateral
336531,ya we will see how it evolves but i think that the vetoken system is misunderstood by a lot of people it is more similar to staked eth and steth on the dapp layer than anything else once you view it like that it helps frame the economics a bit more
336532,why do you think so what are the some reasons
336534,how does convex do the voting on behalf of ve holders technically some contract allows it to reach in and use your vetoken to vote any oss ui for those contracts itd seem curve should put some out to decentralize that game
336535,cvx holders control what the vecrv and soon vefxs that convex holds votes for
336536,it works similar to curve gauges ie if 50 of locked cvx votes for a pool then 50 of convexcontrolled vecrv also votes for that pool
336537,just mirrors the same when do the bribers get their way
336538,thanks do you have gmx specific stats handy would love to know what the cumulative pnl is to date
336539,i think its just a system built on top afaik votium checkpoints addresses that voted on a particular pool and allows them to claim the bribe
336540,howdo votium and convex work together or do they compete
336541,votium doesnt control votes the way convex is said to then ve holders let convex vote for them they dont come having voted already i take it
336542,how come compound forks are exploited so often while the original code has been safe so far except one bug in a proposal code
336543,because devs always change something they dont understand
336544,and people that blatantly fork other protocols with minor changes arent very good devs to begin with
336545,my magic is strong
336546,compound itself had a price oracle exploit with over 90mln of liquidations dai coinbase attack and pretty bad oracles that could lead to a loss of user funds billions of usd for like a year
336547,they also had the v bug which cost them another 90 m i wonder if the forks have this code too
336548,gmx gns personal favorite tbh
336549,so its cvx holders that control curve not convex team while thats more decentralized cant cvx holders now vote in ways harmful to curve and convex then sell their cvx in the same way thats criticized for transferable solidly ve tokens
336550,why would convex voters decide to harm curve when it would damage convex as well
336551,yes they can do that indeed but thats also why cvx also requires nontransferable locking for 16 weeks in order to vote see now youre figuring it all out by yourself
336553,that was a bug in a proposal code not the original codebase so it shouldnt exist in the forks
336554,so what if solidly adds 16 weeks to venft
336555,then were good notice then that proves my entire point of nontransferability on the protocol layer that was my entire premise the entire time that curve and ethereum both have correctly identified that as a crucial part of the design
336556,should ve even be nft then or just erc20 whats the nft benefit
336557,i believe it was an nft because different lock times made the tradeable token nonfungilbe
336559,how does convex handle that
336560,convex just perma locks the crv fxs tokens for 4 years always and issues the derivative token against the max lock 1 for 1 thats why theyre all fungible
336561,in the case of protocol wars holders can vote in ways that benefit their own protocol and if it harms curve or convex they can sell
336562,edit answered above
336563,please read the convex docs these questions are becoming a bit trivial
336564,hi guys in theme of the olafinance hack i wanted to know if anyone knows a way to revoke approvals there seems revokecash doesnt support fuse
336565,hello
336567,when you say so often and coine_r says just about every how many compound forks are you talking about in actual numbers that have had vulnerabilities thanks
336568,ok right convex docs say you lock crv forever and user gets back cvxcrv which is liquid and then you need to lock cvx for 16 weeks to vote so i guess convex socializes the 4 year period down to smaller 16 week chunks trying to get how convex improves things i see they have a function to boot inactive locked cvx thats not voting after 4 weekstrying to figure out how else convex actually fixes or completes whats missing in curve and therefore solidly rekt food farmer has good videos on this stuff
336569,moderately relevantvenus cream rari hundred and this one
336570,granted it might only be relevant for a week
336571,why would anyone lock directly in curve instead of convexand then why shouldnt a new solidly use 16 weeks lock non transfer ve instead of 4 years to replace the need for a convex type sister project it maybe doesnt hurt curve that convex exists but a new solidly would have to wait for it to come solidly already has built in votium too afaik
336572,and one more for polygon
336573,use debankcom they support fuse check the approval tab
336574,thanks would be interesting to see how many compound forks are out there i know that two recently launched on aurora network and theres one thats doing a public tokensale on moonbeammoonriver at the moment
336575,wasnt too keen in downloading their wallet
336576,but thanks
336577,theres probably over a hundred considering how easy it is to hit a button on github especially when theres a howto guide 800 according to but only a few ever make it out
336578,thanks docs helped is this a fair q for channel any thoughts on it
336579,whyare there fewer aave clones no how to guides to make connect the ui compound ui is easieross
336580,code is easier to understand from what i heard
336581,hello everyone could anybody recomend mulisig services such as gnosis
336582,hey guys what projects are you aware of that achieved a substantial tvl 500m without incentives
336583,rari capitals fuse
336584,convex locking mechanics which are borrowed from eps i think would probably make ve33 more challenging to implement
336585,thats something we will probably see more in the future with tokemak
336586,projects dont need to be super inflationary or sometimes not inflationary at all with their emissions since liquidity is provided for them via toke holdersdirectors
336587,how is this even relevant
336588,we will see more projects not having to worry about liquidity mining rewards he was asking for projects that achieved 500m without incentives so i just commented that i think we will see more of them because of tokemaks liquidity direction mechanics
336589,i dont know of any currently though
336590,that doesnt make sense to me because that liquidity is needed to be paid for needs emissions
336591,tokemak doesnt fix any of that though not should it so me sowwy just felt like a muh shill
336592,does anyone know anything about this alleged fantom vm any code available will it come with diff language or just compile solidity
336593,il is incurred onto toke stakers liqudity directors because the lp is done via 2 single staking sides of the reactor
336594,so its different people staking the abc token and the pair token eg usdc or eth
336595,1 it is just a way of renting liquidity maybe cheaper but still costs emissionswould encourage reading this when thinking about liquidity
336596,ye its still rented liquidity still brrr
336597,thanks for the insight sers yes thats what im trying to study basically what are the new ways of attracting liqudity without aggressive inflation will have a read
336598,yearn
336599,hey all ive prepared a super short questionnaire to look into peoples experiences with current crypto tax reporting solutionsno personal info needed whatsoever would really appreciate 2 mins of your time to fill it out
336600,thanks ivangbi
336601,are there any insights on this question
336602,any reward for doing so ill dm you with some feedback
336603,were not collecting emails so its all anon but therell be other things coming up in the future

336623,the tax alfa is to try several tax platforms and use the one that shows the lowest obligations
336624,
336625,i believe it will be very tough for them to implement but the point they are making is not about the technical aspect its about sending the message
336627,i think based on this being a smart contract all those warnings are to much of a concern the contract we lend usdc to a network pair so from a novice looking at this i think im safecan anyone lend a opinion on this one warning it contain a proxy contract it makes possible to change character of main contract is this more concerning to anyone
336631,its likeley an upgradable contract you want to make sure its at least behind a timelock and be on the lookout out for any pending upgrades

336656,i am seeking for some projects to join any ideas
336657,appears to be 75 total for element users of which 35 to lps 35 to traders and 05 to minters
336658,i would highly recommend you to try oldchief casino
336659,whats the ratio of voting power for insiders vs community
336660,i manage a hiring program for framework ventures portfolio companies have plenty of interesting projects to discuss
336661,lowkey always weird when treasury is counted as community allo
336662,yep i have read it thanks it has been snapshot
336663,just filter by outgoing txs
336665,theyve started using outgoing ones as well now pic related all arent from me
336666,idk if theres a good way to fix this but its annoying as hell
336667,never had anything like that happen to me
336671,maybe you are looking at someone elses wallet
336672,lol
336673,no these guys have a list of wallets they do this to
336674,it just means that youve made it
336675,proof of potential target
336676,ultimate degen status
336677,no i dont even have that much money relatively
336678,i think debank fucked me with their algo in the early days with like a wrong flag
336679,that got me way too many ppl watching my wallet so now im on a target list kek
336680,but anyway it would be cool if etherscan could somehow autofilter these obvious scam txs
336681,this looks like a pretty fine split
336682,much better numbers than the euler airdrop at least
336683,1 is a rug
336685,when was that announced
336686,i missed it ye 1 is a rug
336687,
336688,great article about risk assessment in defi more needed than ever
336689,perhaps a little disingenuous marketing as 51 to community but in reality community led or skewed that way probably isnt optimal to actually build something not for degens
336690,and they can pivot to dao tooling with the cool side stuff thats built already
336691,oh the treasury is what theyre calling community thought there was a missing bullet point lol
336692,hmm so am i reading this correctly actual valueless governance token that cannot be used for anything other than voting
336693,its the start probably can take out of vault
336694,
336695,christ how much do these guys ship
336696,elfi distribution to ethereum core devs and defi ecosystem projects
336697,that part is neat
336698,ethereum core devs2250 users get 614 votes eachagreed all airdrops should do that
336699,i think after this airdrop taking them into account future ones will also imposible not to
336700,we depend on them
336701,ethereum core devs 2250 users get 614 votes eachdefi projects that element built on 1586 users get 409 votes eachl2 projects 850 users get 205 votes eachother defi ecosystem projects 695 users get 205 votes eachisnt this way above the stated 125 distribution
336702,rip 0 tokens for me lol i have been lping since like sept 2021
336703,same
336704,lots of other people as well it seems
336705,same rekt lol
336706,there is definitely an issue with the claim hopefully theyll find it soon
336707,sorting it now
336708,i want my weird nft tho ser
336709,its cool that they gave to core devs
336710,every project should do this make them rich
336711,airdrop hunters will all learn deep protocol development to get more drops contribute to geth and danksharding
336712,tbh moving airdrop meta away from basic usetvl metrics have made discords horrible and unmanageable now its all engagement fishing so if you actually want to contribute you have to deal with huge amounts of noise
336713,yeah with some luck theyll set a precedent
336714,the discord thing is stupid its like nobody understands the law of unintended consequences
336715,literally one of the easiest things to game even easier to game than adding liquidity bcoz at least you have to risk
336716,exactly
336717,in what world does eth have 2250 core devs
336718,no airdrop for awesome github repo creators tools creators public goods creators only projects
336719,okay we found front end issue pushing fix now
336720,nan
336721,tough to argue with tbh
336722,pleb loser
336723,ngmi
336724,apparently if u self delegated with 0 tokens u will claim one of those elf whitelist spots
336725,maybe this is misinfo or maybe they will retroactively excludepunish people who do this
336726,but ye do it at your own risk i guess if you want the elf thing
336727,i agree i think people are doing that
336728,they definitely are bcoz basically nobody has claimed according to etherscan
336729,still 11 holders only
336730,i guess its worth punting the gas
336731,our first minting drop is now livedelegate your voting power to yourself or others now to be eligible for minting your elf nft
336732,there is even a message about delegation
336733,nan
336734,amplice is a rugpuller
336736,oh you posted
336737,ser i said do it at your own risk
336738,just trying to share potential alpha with this venerable community
336739,i guess after claim delegators will have some balance so its fair one
336740,about bitcoin fees im wondering if btc is really sustainable in terms of fees and miner rewards seems like today you can fit around 2000 txns in a block and miner rewards are more then 6547000 usd meaning when the protocol stops paying for the miners work txns will have to pay around 65470002000 15275 usd per txn thats way too much even if its an initial setupthots where did i go wrong here
336741,that is discussion of the last 3 years please see some of content by eric weis or whatever his name was and coin center guys they loved discussing that in 2021
336742,savage ivan be savage
336743,gm lobsters okay if i share the conic launch here
336744,nan
336745,oh i guess i just got rugpulled
336746,hey thats me
336747,team announced its a ui bugmany actually got curious because number of delegators increased rapidly
336748,you dont have to deny them of whitelist tbh
336749,i am so glad my 2 txs failed trying to do this lololo
336751,you still have enought time
336752,i guess if you claim and redelegate then you should be fine
336753,the issue is that people could do the same with addresses that will get no airdrop so of course those have to be cut
336754,mine went through goddamnit
336755,something something missing shots you dont take
336756,yea whatever happens i tried my best punish me element senpai
336757,i got a first staker emoji on nansen for a reason after all
336758,lmao
336759,rip
336760,amplice its fixed
336761,can confirm already claimed mine thanks
336762,thanks for being patient
336763,i see some got 100k tokens even damn thats a milly airdrop
336764,10 elfi would love that
336765,thatd be a unicorn fdv not unreasonable
336766,for first few days depending on market liquidity later on well see what is fair i am just letting my airdrop bag speak kek
336767,not trying to trade
336768,hol up a sec fellers what do elfi actually do surely if the protocol operated just fine without decentralising before this token why does it deserve 1b fdv if all its gonna do is slow down judgement i mean the yields are fixed yay wahoo but damn theyre almost as boring as a banks
336769,88mph did this years ago and proved legit noone cares about fixed rate the dev team rotated into another project
336770,depends on your usage of defi security predictability through fixed rates is one of the things that may drive adoption of decentralized finance
336771,always good to have options right
336772,holy ivan has a lot of voting power
336773,even more now kek
336774,are people who delegated when it was 0 tokens banned from the whitelist or they just need to redelegate once they claimed
336775,anyone know when we can actually trade the elfi token interesting airdrop
336776,need someone to make a proposal
336777,indeed my risk tolerance is completely disconnected from the rest of the world lol hope this boosts tvl and protocol fees i want it to work i just dont see a successful example yet 3
336778,well it works fixed rates is a quite standard thing in defi there are dozens of protocols doing it what do you mean
336779,not one of top 30tvl protocols offers fixed rates they function yes but do they work adoption has not taken off to the extent required
336780,this governance interface is nice
336781,delegation was easy gud stuff
336782,wen
336783,ser you have 60k voting power 3rd highest voter chad as far as i can see there are 2 100ks and then u
336784,nan
336785,oh damn that is pretty cool now if i do that windrathio will shit into my coffin right after murdering me
336786,brb making proposal to unlock gearbox
336787,well you have no tokens ser
336788,
336789,
336790,what is this fud
336791,lol what
336792,hes talking as if theyre impossible to unlock
336793,its just the normal larp guys
336794,fudder
336795,partially for regulation partially to focus the dao a bit in early stages but ultimately everyone knows it will be tradeable at some point if not then you cant really call the treasury full of these tokens a treasury at all
336796,does someone has a routine airdrop i have seen resoruces gathering all usetoairdrop platforms
336797,concave pranked
336798,earnfi maybe will be good for u
336799,not all fixed rates are the same but yes if youre trying to fixed rate a compoundesque mm design youre guaranteed to end up with worse not so fixed rates
336800,wen bunchy
336801,got some others products releases before
336802,so if you wanna trade elfi u shudnt delegate it honestly dont think ppl want that nft they just want free money to go
336804,8 figs is a lot
336805,how do i send a sticker here
336806,anyone know of decent mlai focused daos specifically looking for people w interests at the intersection of mlai web3
336807,i believe fetchai is doing something related to it i have not dug into it though
336808,this thing
336809,is it possible to register an ens for a multisignature wallet
336810,yes
336811,what do projects use to create merch in exchange for burning their token
336812,interested in contributing please dm if you are looking for ml researchers
336813,do you happen to do anything related to language modellingnmt stuff
336814,interested in shorting ml daos please dm me with lending opportunities
336815,more of a computer vision guy unfortunately but i am aware of the literature
336816,hey folks im wondering if anybody knows of a solidity pattern or just a technical explanation for how to build partial nft reveals lets say 1000 nfts out of 10k were minted and i want to randomize the tokenid metadataid for those 1000 nfts token ids i can select randomly and assign the mapping which will work for a while but for the last nfts when most of the mapping is filled out it will be hard to find the next unassigned metadata id
336818,0xngmi did this alrdy
336819,check out tubbycats minting code
336820,thanks looking its complicated did they ever do a blog post
336821,
336822,believe this is it
336823,thank you appreciate it reading
336824,
336825,so i now understand batchrevealsol pretty clever solution one improvement would be to be able to modify the batch size during the mint ideally id want to run reveal once per day regardless of how many were minted i think this requires additionally storing which batch each nft was minted in as currently the mapping is determined by dividing tokenidbatch_size
336827,
336829,is there anyone actually working on this perhaps etherscan
336830,
336831,discord users
336832,
336833,
336834,bayc people expressing 0 iq as always
336835,probably there is no compromise anywhere and they are just doing some weird bot permissions to mint some new mutant
336836,any recommended bridge for ethereum to bsc
336837,celer seems to only have bnb chain which didnt work
336838,synapse is a good bridge
336839,multichain
336840,cheapest and coolest bridge
336841,checked this and it only had bnb chain not bsc
336842,bsc is now bnb chain
336843,a test tx i did from celer ethbnb didnt materialize in my metamask
336844,like it usually would
336845,check all bridges and see which has the best prices
336846,check their tg maybe some delays
336847,use
336848,has anyone looked into this
336849,hows this diff from like cross chain aave bridges in v3
336850,this seems like a convoluted simple bridge or the article just made 0 sense nothing new by the looks of it
336852,so like layerzero plus instadapp for managing positions i guess
336854,probably neither of those too vague even arringtons taste is pure crapnot trying to offend founders
336855,he has a 100100 shit hit though
336856,this is a metric that vc list should be orderd by lol
336858,did gearbox recieve an alloc in elfi tokens ivangbi
336859,i think both discord and github can claim later only
336860,but apeir99n do this urself or mikael actually
336862,ok didnt check yet how get github part of airdrop does there airdrop for protocol discords too
336863,no u need to insert some secret key to get it on april 6 same as discord almost
336864,
336865,very interesting thread about amms from amber there is a full report as well
336866,weird theres no mention of solidly models thats a big improvement in terms of fees for users
336867,
336868,ye idk why you write a research post that is already outdated pretty much the moment you publish
336869,dubai police raffle off nft lmao
336870,vitalik buterins website rssclick for the full articlein defense of bitcoin maximalism
336871,gm sers lrevenant nicolas_993we actually have a feature for this in place but need to make sure it can handle etherscans scale before properly releasing it wont be automatic filtering though we try to lean away from censorship as a rule but it will be relatively simple from the users side not as simple for the team unfortunately
336873,should be safu as long as you always look at the txn creator right
336874,yeah but if this happens more often your etherscan will be filled with outgoing trxs you didnt do would be really hard to filter which ones are yours i hope they implement some kind of filter soon
336879,pls gib airdrop to lobsters
336880,single sided lp vaults for convex curve sounds nice though
336881,got a og role i will try it
336884,
336885,arthur like passive incoooooom
336886,
336887,wat does dis do
336888,this new eu regulations isnt approved yet no
336889,no
336890,now in 23 years to be effective
336891,and maybe some changes between
336892,any source about this
336893,well is the normal times of this type of approvals
336895,
336896,fiskantes airdrop for his social friends
336897,dope
336898,probably april 1
336899,i still to drop l3x to all my twitter followers and paid substack subscribers but i couldnt figure out an easy way to do it maybe some of what he does will be repurposeable
336900,ah fuck
336901,oh well
336902,haha i fell for it
336903,ivan cant be far away
336904,maybe next year
336905,writing a thread for april 1 i dont know how to talk about it ser
336906,responsibilities ivangbi
336907,oh fug i dont even know what it is
336910,hidden hand a bribes marketplace
336911,ribbon just sells options then
336912,i believe verbn directs rbn emissions to gauges right so this is like bribecrv on top hidden hand a bit like oly proinfra as a service they take a fee
336913,good to hear
336915,
336916,lmao wtf ive read
336920,does a really high selected gas limit lower than block gas limit have any negative effect on miner pick up eg if i set gas limit 10 mio
336921,will they be ignored at end of block
336922,so if eg bloxk already filled to 999
336923,will they just ignore these huge gas limit tx even though they might only use eg 100k
336924,previously we announced on discord and social media that minting will last till 9 am pst on april 2 but we actually deployed the contract with a minting end date and time set at 9 am pst on april 1so if you want to mint season pass nft you have time till 9 am pst on april 1
336925,not april fools
336926,so its over
336927,still 1h30
336928,all right thanks for sharing
336930,any idea why im not eligible did i miss a step connected with my wallet which has the lobster nft
336931,im not sure better head to dexguru discord to askedit seems like they recommend to clear the cache and cookies for dexguru and retry
336932,wait isnt ai block chain a standard boomer larp
336933,and makes no sense at all
336934,surprised that an og like uh actually seems to follow this does ai block chain actually make sense how
336935,yeah it was probably the reason
336936,this summarizes some of the works looks like they recently 2021 were able to push it to a journal as well
336937,ai is larp in traditional companies too usually fund raising artificial intelligencehiring machine learningcode excel
336938,lol
336939,
336940,thats extremely unprofessional sneg55 you just rekt your community

336942,yep same
336943,u can buy on opensea going for 004 eth
336944,got one yea hope it delivers
336945,yeah it will
336946,does anybody know if theres any insurance cover for multichain the bridge on the market
336947,uncommon core best one but few episodesthe scoop rather market drivenunchained sometimes good interviewsuponly for fun
336948,if you read the contract code start and end dates were here when we deployed it nothing has changed it was a typo in announcement with april 2 instead of april 1

336969,dailyapedao huh call a15z
336970,yep and you announced that it was a typo right before the mint process endedif you read the contract code start and end dates were here when we deployed itlook i dont want to spam this chat with useless arguing but its just ridiculous you made a mistake and now youre trying to say that its our own fault that we didnt check your smart contract code and didnt notice your own typowell have fun launching a token with a pissed off community i guess
336971,all this for an airdrop
336972,
336973,best joke so far
336974,this is a good one too
336977,arxiv has nothing to do with a journal
336978,literally anyone can upload something to arxiv
336979,ser i meant the authors pushed it to this journal
336980,i quoted arxiv cause it was the earliest version i found i know how arxiv works thank you
336981,anyone with confirmed phd degree any field and coauthors can be without phdtheres for sure a certain percentage of higlyengaged works but they dont get much attention
336982,ah pardon usually theres a link on the arxiv page once the paper is published thats why i was confused ty ser
336983,should have googled before accusing my bad scorched from all those crypto communities throwing peer reviewed papers at you and then walking home with an arxiv link suggestion never enter a radix community platform
336984,is there a tldr what blockchain ai brings to the table
336985,all good ser yea i relate to what you mean i invested in deep brain chain and lost all my monies before learning how to readwrite a paper
336986,wow thats a name i havent seen in a while lol
336987,if you are aware of basics of ml you would be able to pick some of them and dig deeper to see if they are indeed good i have not done a deep divethis is the lab leading some things looks like from a brief glance that guy has a stellar publication record in all top ml confjournals
336988,this is not the chat for entitled community members wed like all the devs in this chat to stay in this chat
336989,well for now from my observations aiblockchain is being used in establishing an optimal miningstrategy as an improvement to 5g6g technology or for security several studiesarxivorgpdf220305471pdfarxivorgpdf220103201pdfarxivorgpdf220211264pdfarxivorgpdf220210336pdfarxivorgpdf211214078pdfarxivorgpdf191112942pdfi saw one interesting realworld application with my own eyes in it ai and blockchain were used to distribute the load due to ddos attack on onion site the system detected the situation itself and automatically copied the containers to new ips thus ensuring 100 availability of the site for users all actions were coordinated by a smart contract which managed the load and it was a private blockchain ai was used to build more clever system and analyzed logs it was an endgame implementation
336990,blockchain has two basic things that will help everyone the ability to reliably store and validate information so it cannot be faked or use it as an alternative layer which is not backend not frontend but data layer which benefits security logic so just take these two and mix them with ai
336991,ty ser was there something like keepers who triggered the smart contract to do the coordination since a smart contract cant do any action without being called
336992,this was done in automatic mode in manual mode you had to buy a lot of ip and so on and load them to the system
336993,unfortunately i was too young to remember everything in detail but the load balancing system definitely worked on the blockchain
336994,no modern blockchain could feasibly support enough compute or data for a practical ml model so most of the time the ai blockchain buzzwords are used its at best a centrallyrun model applied to some blockchain data but its kind of smoke and mirrors since the model doesnt care that it analyzes blockchain data in particular you can train a graph cnn to classify blockchain txn but you can sic the same model on any kind of graph data really theres nothing intrinsically web3 about such projects not in the ones ive seen anyway
336995,does anyone know of an excel or google sheet add on that is able to pull information from a eth contract ex how many of x tokens a wallet is holding of
336996,cryptosheetscom maybe or mb try using bloxyinfo
336997,it could be possible to merge the two in a meaningful way in the future if the snark vc efficiency catches up like an rltrained agent adjusting protocol parameters eg risk parameters in a lending market and supplying proofs that it was run correctly but it is a very longhorizon thing
336998,i think its relevant to also point out that advanced ml is being used heavily for data analysis of blockchains think of fraud detection based on wallet activity onchain scores security profiles etc
336999,the entirety of tornadocash will eventually be deanonymized by ml algorithms willing to bet nsa already has the tech
337000,for tornado cash there is an awesome tutelaxyz working on scripts not ml but anyways
337001,or have been running it entire time p
337002,i appreciate that might actually be able to track down a certain hacker i have beef with
337003,in 2075
337004,let me tell you about a cool doxxing method nft with an ip logger pixelmediumcomalxlpsccriticalprivacyvulnerabilitygettingexposedbymetamask693c63c2ce94
337005,honestly pretty stupid to be in black hat work right now its only a matter of time before you get denonymized might be 5 years might be 10 but really high quality ml stuff makes it ultimately a losing game data is there forever
337006,yes but how do you accomplish that with someone attacking a reentrancy vulnerability with a singleuse address
337007,alas it takes a social engineering genius to make a hacker make a mistake at least in this hypothetical situation
337008,agree wholeheartedly but its like people who are getting cryogenesis in hope that well have the tech to revive them in the future tx logs will be onchain for hundreds of years at that point ml on graphs will be so advanced it will be trivial to find anything
337009,check out as well sir might help you3twittercomofficer_ciastatus1493395239905734667
337010,that or hes just dumb and misses your lps entirely until the geniuses at peckshield start livetweeting about the stillunsecured contractsand the only reason your lp survives is a breakglass you activated 70 seconds before the hacker returned for the remaining value hed been informed about on twitterall hypotheticals of course
337011,frens has anyone done arb only with tsjs not deploying contracts is it even feasibly competitive
337012,also sers if anyone interested in joining dedicated mev discord dm me its gated but we can talk if you have some alpha to contribute
337013,i dont think you can do any interesting arb without deploying your own contracts trading bot either written tsjs or golang python can help you submit transactions youll need a program contract that executes complicated strategies onchain for you
337014,
337015,interesting distributions that
337016,thats so nicely written pretty cool
337017,or you can do way more interesting ones because all the uninteresting ones are saturatedbut wont last long
337018,yeah
337019,
337020,redacted bought out by terra
337021,unofficially bought out
337022,or am i reading it wrong
337023,basically ye
337024,with all forks dying i dont think this is a bad move smart they been making interesting degen econ things issa interesting to read
337025,ye sounds like a win win tbh
337026,
337027,the 5 over market bribe is actually quite high until bribes cost gets diluted to oblivion
337032,is there anyone else besides polygon who are using plonky2 for their zk rollup
337033,all actions were coordinated by a smart contract which managed the loadcant imagine what this would look like why would there be any need for a smart contract for load balancing logic also its debatable whether smart contracts on private blockchains are actually smart contracts or just regular distributed apps
337035,the whole soon aiml will deanonymize all tornado users thing is also highly questionable its not some kind of magic that can work around cryptography most likely it will just reduce the manual effort needed for unmasking people who made mistakes in the first place
337036,just researched this question one again and found some great stuff on using smart contracts in ddos attack mitigationieeexploreieeeorgdocument8892947mdpirescomd_attachmentsymmetrysymmetry1300227article_deploysymmetry1300227v2pdfhalinriafrhal01806063arxivorgpdf220203617pdf
337037,as i have mentioned i did not know how the described system works exactly well now there is something we can compare based on these studies
337038,anyway the original question was about the practical application of blockchain and mlai and concepts we just went too far definitely not trying to fud tornado they are awesome tutela has received their grant as well
337039,this approach proposes an architecture and an implementation of an approach to signaling white or blacklisted ip addresses across multiple domains based on blockchains and smart contracts the advantage of using smart contracts in a blockchain is a to make use of an already existing infrastructure to distribute rules without the need to build specialized registries or other distribution mechanismsprotocols b to apply rules across multiple domains which means that even if the as autonomous system of the victim is not applying these rules some traffic can still be filtered and c the victim or its as can control which customers get blocked the only central element remaining is to show proof of ip ownershipthis seems to be the relevant part the idea is basically to use a public blockchain to distribute filter rules attacker ips
337040,not about cryptography more about just seeing where 1 02 02 02 02 02 1 againthat allows you to narrow it down significantly
337041,humans like to centralize thats a vector for mldriven analysis
337042,i get the idea but thats not exactly how it works you can already do that
337043,yes but the nsa has software that can identify you based on the way you write so im not gonna be too suprised when theyve already cracked torn
337044,people not the math are always the weak link in systems like this
337045,yeah but if 100 people but 01 eth in and 100 people take 01 eth out you will not be able to find who exactly is responsible for which deposit
337046,this is not like writing styles where you have tons of unique markers
337047,yes but when one person steals exactly 3852 eth and it fragments then another wallet slowly receives 3852 eth over the course of several weeks you can start to make educated guesses from there only need parallel construction
337048,see above most likely it will just reduce the manual effort needed for unmasking people who made mistakes in the first place
337049,assuming its not split up between walelts and not withdrawn in fixed increments like 1 eth
337050,putting in 3852 eth and withdrawing the exact same amount to a single wallet is the kind of mistake i am talking about and even then you have the problem of plausible deniability
337051,i think youre vastly underestimating the computing power that can be thrown at problems like this and remember you dont have to deal with just computers today its crypto so those records are gonna be around in 5 10 20 years when computing has improved even further
337052,people thinks ml analytics will solve it but lt wont i think regulators will demand full kyc and resource of funds for every single wallet used mixers in a couple years
337053,you can throw as much computing power and aiml at it as you want if there is no possible logical solution for the problem you wont get the solution
337054,yes and if i have sufficient datasets which we can assume i do for the sake of argument ill know that your exchange accounts slowly withdrew around 3852 eth that seemingly showed up in them through torn wallets
337055,you are basically saying that you can unmask people if you have a dataset which allows unmasking them the point is that in many cases you just wont have that due to the nature tornado works ai is not magically going to change that you just dont have the input variables for the output you wantif you have lets say 10 people who interact with tornado cash in exactly the same way you will never be able to tell them apart beyond reasonable doubt
337056,tornado is not magically going to keep you private
337057,no technology will you have to use it properly but if used properly theres also limits to what ai can do
337058,you seem to be missing the point an amount x went into torn from an anon walletan amount x flowed into your bank account or into wallets known to be under your control it came from torn by watching the io flows i can reasonably narrow down the list of people who received xthen i can scrutinize them more thoroughly and start adding up their io at a personal levelwhen something doesnt add up i can very easily apply further scrutiny until i have found the right person
337059,i could certainly see someone making a risk score per wallet based on some already known patterns interacted with tornado hold some compromised eth not sure if something as specific as did this wallet do this hack is relevant at that level all one needs to do is keep monitoring wallets for abnormal activity and then dig deeper when needed manually
337060,cba to discuss this its certainly not me whos missing the point here gn
337061,we know where value is created we know where value is destroyed and we know where it flows in and out we have a list of unknowns and need to solve for them the data lasts forever and whenever we get new tech we can throw it at the problem that doesnt sound like a winning game to me
337062,not as simple as that though if you the only one using it properly then it doesnt matter that you are anyway this is all far more nuanced than this convo it is all pretty useless
337064,thats like saying we will be able to determine whether 2 or 2 is the actual and only square root of 4 we just need more technology and computing power
337065,all this discussion reminds me of a good quote in theory theory and practice are the same in practice they are not
337066,im not claiming that we can narrow it down to 100 confidence more that we can narrow it down to a set so small it wont really make a difference to a human
337067,kind of like how image recognition got to the point that a computer could reliably tell the difference between dogs and cats once they got good at having multiple layers took them 3 decades but now your phone does it for you in the background
337068,maybe you could track down every 20 dollar bill that was used today and doxx me based on this information
337069,tornado isnt free
337073,the protocol is free but gas and optional use of relayers are not
337074,those are part of its proper functionality so either way saying that just because you can unmask people that basically put a neon sign on their backs announcing they wasted their time using tornado cash means some aibrockshane contraption will unmask everyone that reads the manual is an impressive case of jumping to conclusions the bias due to an exploit notwithstanding
337075,youre handwaving away an unsolvable problem by just saying ai will solve it doesnt really make any sense
337076,this may be silly ill give you that some bandits may redeploy to a set of adjacently related addresses and then leave enough breadcrumbs for a pattern recognition tool ai to connect the dots back to thembut an astute bandit would put in the work to ensure they modularized sequester the down stream exit points destinationsfor example if the desire to not be found is high enough why not fragment the re aggregation over time location and just disappear not useburnbury 310 cheaper than paying taxesi think the larger challenge is how to reliably do the wash then get what you want in meat space
337080,i cant believe i got rugged by a nft airdrop i literally put it in my calendar to mint today
337081,alejoamiras vpepo how does mean rely on uniswap on optimism as an oracle givenon optimism every transaction is confirmed as an individual block theblocktimestampof these blocks however reflect theblocktimestampof the last l1 block ingested by the sequencer for this reason uniswap pools on optimism are not suitable for providing oracle prices as this highlatencyblocktimestampupdate process makes the oracle much less costly to manipulate
337082,adding computer power to ml calculation is not all you need to solve any identification problemfor cookies user fingerprint data when you can add range of input features for a user yesfor just one input amount well nonns are not magic boxes
337083,next version of torn nova i could see no reason to withdraw from tornado you can send and receive do swaps use defi funds will just live in darkness
337084,
337085,insane amounts of piles
337086,nan
337088,my 4pool thread to follow up dos big tweets is coming up tomorrow wait for the alpha im gonna be dropping
337089,what r ur feelingsthots about entire supply being owned by these sers michwill
337090,
337091,oh thanks meh the larping continues
337092,is there a way to use ternary operator in solidity with events basically something like thisemit condition eventa eventb kinda useful when having events with identical structureternary seems to be working for contract functions but cant get it to work with events am i being dumb or is this missingi know that one way would be do add an additional bool flag to the event params but actually interested if its possible to do the other way
337093,pay user push out competitors market monopoly profit on monopoly happens in tech every day in web 2 you begin to charge users once they dont have other choices with a sustainable ponzu you can charge them and also make them feel happy this is a miracle long live web3
337094,you are a communist stop with these communist talks
337095,not the entire supply and also its not what people think they think curve wars are over this is bad for curve that couldnt be further than the truth its more like the 2nd layer curve wars are about to begin with competition for which metapool is going to be the base primitive for all projects
337096,to be honest everyone wins in this free market competition new projects get support from the big mcap stables like ust frax and i assume dai otherwise theyll slowly shrink in curve tvl the new projects will enjoy joint liquidity incentives to win over their base metapool choice then curve wins obviously and lastly the biggest winners are the lp enjoyooors of these yields
337097,this is real everybody wins in web3
337098,except for dai i guess such a bad name is there any stablecoin called survive would like to buy some
337099,easy to commend why they named as dai i really dislike people come here after 5 years and make no search but comment about things without exploring reasons etc
337100,i really dislike when people assume all idiots have recently arrived plenty of the ignorant have been here for years my friend
337101,sorry will stop shiting on them got some mkr and i am poor
337102,then i sold my mkr to flx and i am broke
337103,sorry for these salty jokes will stop now
337109,
337110,
337111,not great
337112,inversefinance dead
337113,anyone would be free to do a little help with a shitcoin contract
337114,nourharidy
337115,whats the tldr on the exploit
337116,ivigamberdiev ser do ur job blz
337117,15m profit and the root cause is oracle misuse
337118,is it good sir
337119,almost now need oracles in question assets affected and how it was used to influence this
337120,well thats not everything at least fuckinverse good coin
337121,only aneth related
337122,youve already taken me ten minutes
337123,if that borrow apy is correct yall better check your positions
337124,its gone
337125,aaaand its gone like gone
337126,he left just 73 eth in there so nasty man super sad to see it get drained before ur eyes
337127,down bad
337128,or technically debt free
337129,sooo is dola ded
337130,sorryi dont really get this
337131,you mean rugpul
337132,pretty much drained the majority of the funds i would say yes
337133,what was the problem with the project
337134,i will help with anything related to marketing of your project sers thanks
337135,might be a cynic take but wonder if it has anything to do with nour being vocal about other stablecoins which might have lead to malicious actors having a closer look at his own code
337136,same thoughts someones been pissed and chose violence
337137,well before attacking others gotta make sure your own protocol works sustainable stablecoins are the ones surviving in the end
337138,are we shorting the dola
337139,heh we are just now risk scoring stablecoin pools on curve for their depeg risk will publish soon
337140,nan
337141,hey guys anyone know of faucet for rinkeby that gives moer than 01 reth each time
337145,please also publish the criteria you are using to determine the risk score
337146,he was on tweet all day to talk about ust frax
337147,right and that justifies taking the money from unsuspecting users wait
337149,tfw you use mycryptocom giving 001 and are thinking of training a neural net for the captchas
337150,
337151,isnt this the oldest play in the book
337152,himb smb can help me how to subscribe to email push notifications and handle them in realtime net c
337153,
337154,this part is interesting not everybody has 901 eth just conspiracy theories
337159,very cool i am really interested how can we follow your development on this is there a tweeterz
337160,vanilla oracle manipulation
337161,isnt vanilla sameblock though this one got some sprinkles on top
337163,i mean this is like stomping through the flower fields with impunity not afraid of falling into a ditch losing 901 eth if they get caught
337164,how would they lose it
337165,does anyone here have direct contact with nour
337166,how i understood it is they needed to manipulate the oracle for several blocks which leaves it open to manipulation on the opposite direction before they stole all that collateral
337167,sure they would have lost a bunch but not the full 900
337168,then probably would at least twist an ankle and not fall into the ditch entirely appending on my metaphor
337169,
337170,hey coiner a mean dev here that is actually a great question but optimism evm has updated the return of blocktimestamp now timestamp actually work as expected sadly i cant find optimisms release notes
337171,guess its going to be a busy day for defi more to come likely
337172,not really keep3r oracle shouldnt be used so widely
337173,also it wasnt even audited afaik
337174,same block price computing
337175,falling victim to its own criticism then duh
337176,you referring to keep3r or inverse
337177,inverse youre supposed to ensure using safe periphery as well not really into the whole keep3r story tho looks like it shouldnt be used that way without additional measures
337178,were a nice cartel everyone we support profitsat least its not like the consensuslevel version where pretending the community can vote out the cartel is the norm wen new larimer experiment
337179,new article from vitalik is a masterpiece quite surprising to see him endorsing btc vs other coins including eth actually
337180,monopoly is not possible in crypto because of open source
337181,anyone unhappy can just exit build
337182,this is naive crypto didnt invent being open source
337183,its naive if youre not a builder if you are you can do whatever you want it is severely underestimated how powerful this is
337184,while its definitely harder doesnt think opensource prevents monopoly completely
337185,lol
337186,
337187,this is a wow
337188,this idealistic storytelling will never cease to be amusing mustve been nice for the projects that had to change their licenses to be more restrictive when reality hit
337189,without idealism you dont build anything new
337190,new things are not invented they are discovered
337191,maybe but thats not a good enough justification to stick ones head in the sand
337192,thats true for science not sociology
337193,ahem wen tornado flash loans
337194,damn that would be pretty cool gas fee is paid by ur tornado deposit and the tx is submitted by a relayer
337196,think it would reduce privacy 100x make it much easier to trace the link between depositwithdrawal address
337197,chomsky winks at you
337200,thats an exploiter moving funds from an old hack ya not another new hack
337201,yea old one
337202,deleted
337203,ivigamberdiev where did you got that the oracle from inverse was keep3rs
337204,i answered this post earlier you can read more here mediumcomneuronfunddont think it can even be percieved as shillivangbi i am once again asking you to stay fair and not to redact legit stuff
337205,inverse oracles storage
337206,mainly asking because that oracle hasnt been maintained for over a year and announcements has been done regarding that
337207,so they never modified until now
337208,looks like
337209,welp
337210,does frax amo minter have some kind ui something like dai psm
337211,they werent using keep3r network oracle deprecated they were using the same code that was manually executed by the deployers address to update the price
337212,optimism dev here its at
337213,but i still wouldnt advise using uniswap prices as an oracle if im not mistaken uniswap price reflects the price in the last block at least thats how it worked in v2 on optimism every transaction is currently its own block and the mempool is private this can lead to a situation where an attacker manipulates the price by buying a lot in a tx performs some action using the manipulated price in the next tx and then reverse the price manipulation by selling the bought token in the third tx he can submit them in rapid fire and nobody will be able to react fast enough to enable them arb the manipulation since the mempool is private and transaction are being processed fifothis will be fixed in our upcoming bedrock release were we will have actual blocks minted at regular intervals though obviously this doesnt eliminate all the risks of using uniswap as an oracle as always this is required reading
337214,interestingly this attack is still feasible by the sequencer which is a real concern for when we will decentralize the sequencer weve been discussing this here with saurik our 2m bounty claimant
337215,interesting
337216,is arbitrum vulnerable to the same issue
337217,im not super familiar w their design but looking at arbiscan it also looks libe they have 1 txblock so i would say yes
337218,
337219,
337220,interestingly looks like the inversefinance hack looks exactly like the attack i described above which shows that even mainnet is not immune to this kind of attack looks like the key was that it wasnt possible to really exploit the inv price discrepancy no other liquidity pools nobody could do what he did because they didnt have inv in store and they would have to recognize that loaning at that inflated price was a good deal which would have been really tricky for a bot to figure out they even used twap as the oracle so its not even naive spot pricedeets in this link that was shared above
337221,how long was it
337222,im still trying to figure out how they maintained the oracle at such high prices while the oracle has to be maintained manually
337223,jesus
337224,insane
337225,looks like the price was actually arbed back but too late
337226,it seems like the oracle wasnt warded
337227,nan
337228,they didnt need to maintain it over a large period
337229,once the imbalance was produced they just updated the oracle rate
337230,
337231,i do
337232,
337233,
337234,we got a war room if you can and are willing to contribute lmk
337235,dola peg is only suffering a small 4m bad debt were raising rates significantly across lending protocols using our feds and the peg should be fully restored within hours
337236,it will take a lot more than this to bring dola down given the peg enforcement tools at our disposal
337237,hey nour sorry and sad for what happened and happy to help
337238,i appreciate your kindness but please dont feel sad or sorry ive been ready for this from day 1 i signed up for this and im ready to take 10x more
337239,its more from a founders perspective but i get your point and thats the right spirit
337240,inverse has already grown a sustainable business model and is able to pay its debt from its growing revenue
337241,
337242,ammderived oracles especially on l2s apparently are somewhere between a deadend and playing with dynamite discuss
337243,not really you just need to define well how you want to handle them
337244,like probably linkies are making a party out of this hack but chainlink only works because its a permissioned system that trusts that all their entities will behave as intended
337245,if inv would have set a require for the oracle update to be permissioned only to governance there was almost 0 chance of this happening if they would execute the oracle update on a public mempool and it got frontrunned then its the same attack vector but without the attacker being able to update the oracle themselves
337247,frax is pretty small at 25b market cap compared to dai 10b considering how much attention frax gets why is that why does cmc show it as token 205 at 25b it should be in top 60 cmc hates frax fxs seemed like a good low buy before the 4pool news still seems not very expensive
337248,for this case but isnt that an expensive unscalable and still permissioned bandaid perhaps redundant but wouldnt the attack still be possible with a permissionless system that relied on keepers whichever version
337249,any bridge of frax and ust to metis can you help get it
337250,yes it would have been the same if you allow for the transaccion to be triggered on a public mempool
337251,if not the cost goes exponential because they will need to be betting on when the update transaction would arrive rug all the liquidity from the pool for several blocks
337252,dola peg is already nearly restored thanks to increased borrow rates in response to the demand drop
337253,well continue to raise rates across lending protocols until dola is at 1 within the next couple hours
337254,dang thats some conviction sounds like dola is in good hands good luck
337255,hey nour i get your reasoning as to why you dont want to get an audit but surely the time has arrived to at least consider one once the dust settles it would really help to have a professional set of eyes look at the code you can dismiss its findings but you cant deny that its a useful process to undertake what youre pulling off in spite of all these difficulties is indeed impressive but there are ways that might prevent them from happening in the first place
337256,this issue would not have been caught by an audit it is a volatility risk issue not a code exploit im finding my own alternative to audits using my defi olympiads experiment thanks for bringing it up tho
337257,just to be clear im against corporate audits we always get some community reviewers to look at our critical code
337258,pretty sure trail of bits would have caught this or at least mentioned it in their report for you to consider they comment on both economic as well as code relatedexploits top audit firms would definitely catch this regardless great work in responding to this situation and being quick very impressive
337259,yeah i remember discussing this with harry and he raised some valid points about low quality audits leading to a false sense of user security
337260,the context under which this attack was conducted would not be accountable for by an auditor its a combination of decreased pair liquidity mev games and arbitrage inefficiency
337261,as someone whos gotten multiple tob audits and a recurring annual contract with them i can confidently say they would have in my opinion tob is one of the best firms in the space though im not saying any of the others would find it again not here to debate you good work in your response and quick remediation especially the peg but consider tob they are very good
337262,thank you for your recommendation sam ill genuinely consider it
337263,page 13 identifies an mev exploit sam and i arent paid by tob maybe we should be lol but they really do take so many different things into account
337264,but yeah kudos on where its due otherwise you have some good processes in place to deal with this very impressed with the reaction speed otherwise
337265,
337266,finding more
337267,v interesting
337268,
337269,
337270,what was the inverse twap interval
337272,
337273,what happened
337274,2020
337275,nan
337276,
337277,i dont know what to say
337278,everybody shat on the word risk fucked their cousins walks around naked with their pp flashing out giga longs meme stocks and shitposts on twitter if thats peak performance i am not made for it
337279,hey guys are there any 3rd party dapps that allows you to see your lp gains from curve and uniswap
337280,revert finance works no
337281,only uniswap and sushiswap nothing on yearn
337282,ah yearn my bad me dumb dunno
337283,no worries thanks
337288,
337289,does been have a token its partnered from a la ust and luna or how fxs and frax i couldnt for the life of me understand wtf was going on with it their docs are too confusing
337290,when can we buy element token
337291,having same issues over here
337292,whenever trading is enabled
337293,
337296,aave fam i invite you to take a look and vote on this fresh snapshot proposal to get lido stmatic as collateral to the polygon aave v3
337297,arent these kinds of exploits also possible for raris fuse pools i mean they use all those small coins as collaterals surely theres not a chainlink oracle for all those collaterals
337298,yep happens all the time lol they use v3 twaps and low cap pools can be easily exploited the lending pools are isolated though so users are encouraged to not use the low liq ones
337299,lowliq v3 pool is even easier to manipulate because you just have to push the price outside of the main liquidity ticks and then can effectively make the price infinite twap interval doesnt help much in this case with v2 i imagine if twap interval was used correctly the inverse hack would have been way more difficult if not impossible
337300,so everybody knows those fuse pools are exploitable but they still keep them up hoping that hackers are nice and ignore the loot thats there for the taking
337301,wtf
337302,its permissionless anyone can create a fuse pool
337307,you love to see it
337308,where can i see multichain tvl of frax
337309,new comer for the battle field
337310,
337311,what is better plan than cvx purchasing or bribing
337312,i sympathize with nour and the good postmortem media coverage plus he was building for a while during bear too and learned a lot but the goalpost shifting while shitting on everyone is just sad weird agenda all around toxic as hell standing strong on your beliefs can be okay but it always reads like you are shit because i am better and not just criticism of designs no hate or anything at all i just hope when i am or my frens try to be critical of designs approaches it doesnt appear as toxic and rude cause if it does then i am sorry and would change not cool to be like that
337313,samczsun ser wut happenedpoly down bad lol
337314,yeah let me explain somewhere that isnt twitter
337315,i want to use weth on matic
337316,the expectation is i bridge eth to matic i use the gasless swap to get matic it takes 10 minutes and im done
337317,the reality was i bridge eth to matic the gasless swap doesnt work because metamask says the signature is too long 1024 theres no native trezor connect option and the rpc fails 90 of the time with header not found or straight up returns a 429
337318,so either i find a friend to give me some matic or i pay mainnet gas fees to buy and bridge a single matic or i sell my eth for stables bridge my stables and buy eth on matic again
337319,what the fuck
337320,the last 60 minutes of my life
337321,i sent a swap tx to the rpc and im pretty sure it just vanished into the void
337322,just to confirm what rpc you using
337323,polygonrpccom
337324,fantom was a bit of a similar experience but not as sad cause some anon faucet helped not throwing shade at the the devsso i bought ftm wanted to swap it around but multichain had no liquidity back then aggregators didnt have anything as a result either because that was the main one anyway found some 10 ftm on one bridge and swapped it received wftm i could not use for gas fees great had to find a faucet that said if you did a multichain swap but never used fantom before you can get some for gas fees
337325,whatever it autoprompted me to switch to
337326,which is for some reason lmao what
337327,no no thats the old one sir use the polygonrpccom
337328,even the latest docs mention this one as preffered
337329,can u try this step again with the new one please
337330,i ended up getting some matic from friends so im all set now but the next time i have some time to spare ill try again
337331,i checked all the sites i visited and none of them tried to add maticvigil as an rpc so i can only assume i had it loaded from when i was doing research on matic however long ago it was
337332,so thats good at least
337333,actually i couldnt just leave it at that
337334,so i tried the gasless swap again
337335,nan
337337,this again with trezor i am assuming
337338,yes
337339,huh whats so rude about this tweet what goal post is shifting here i still think curve wars are dumb
337340,am i toxic for disagreeing with the status quo
337341,curve wars are dumb its causing billions of dollars of liquidity to be wasted sitting around doing nothing with tiny daily volumes this whole game of maximizing liquidity just for the sake liquidity only for the optics of looking huge makes no sense to me but fine if im left with no other choice after a year of going for the 100 organic path and now a 15m bad debt to be paid ill play
337342,best of luck with navigating the situation watching that part w admiration i wasnt dunking at all not this concrete case its the messaging across the board was just making a comment at how its tough to criticize anyones anything wo appearing as toxic which i often do too so was just calling for friendsrainbowunicorns you dont have to hate others to succeed ser
337344,so despite your initial concerns which you still have you decided to join the dark side
337345,1 ive spent the entire day doing exactly what youre asking2 this attack is far from vanilla involving 3m capital cost by the attacker significant risk manoeuvring mev botsarbitragers deep understanding of keep3r twap oracles flaws3 i can spend my time however i want and say whatever i want
337346,ser this is not nice to say or assume a dev does not spend enough time on their own creation being critical of other designs is okay as long as it is in good faith and not blabla and doesnt mean it cant be hand in hand with coding yours learning designs is also good for your own understanding
337347,in any case incentivising vecrv holders right now seems to do a good job for liquidity more so than vlcvx holdersthe risk premium for dola should be up significantly i wonder at what apy will the pool actually recapitalise something for the market to decide
337348,attack is definitely nontrivial so quite interesting to study it also
337349,lesser of two evils the other evil would be dying a slow death trying to organically build up volumes for dola while under the pressure of 15m debt its simply impossible to build up long term confidence in the stability of a stablecoin protocol with 15m losses due
337350,id do that in context of using curve v2 pools price oracles i think need to do something to prevent similar attacks if they are used en masse especially for smaller pools
337351,any data on capital efficiency of vecrv vs vlcvx bribes
337352,nobodys tried to manipulate those yet abra cauldrons are the only ones using it afaik
337353,also any tips for timing votes is it better to allocate bribes early vs later sorry im kinda new
337354,llamaairforce has some stats for votium i think this tweet does a good job comparing the two approaches
337355,i couldnt find any curvewars talk in the inverse discord where do i have to look for this
337356,it was initially shared as an option in the twitter space since then contributors have been going though different strategies internally
337357,i think today some proposals should be presented
337358,just my thoughts on bribes i see it more like a business deal between protocols and vecrv holders to drive inflation towards a new construction project defi lending platform interfacing via a liquidity pool say abra does a bdeal with curvedao and bribes for their mim3crv pool to receive curve inflation which benefits abra and curve at the same timeright now curve is funding vyperlang someone could just as easily bribe vecrv holders to vote in favor of the vyperlang fundraising gauge its a bit like a decentralised monetary policy experiment and todays best use case is the amm one day we may fund ethereum devs via the protocol guild and anyone interested in funding them could simply interface with votium or better vote with their vecrv or vlcvxhating on curve wars misses this in my opinion
337359,whoever zapper is here if and when you do airdrop w nfts idk how just saying make sure to exclude this address and all their destinations you can see the disperse and sybilling all around just fyi
337360,you kept saying on twitter about how you could easily cover it cause dola was the best designed stable out there and inverse has the cash
337361,while nours communication could use some work nowhere was stated that it would be easily done that said unless they take additional capital no vc mantra and dont want to compromise future growth it is long and painful road ahead to make users whole good luck to the team
337362,could use some work is quite the understatement heh
337363,not sure of the crv gauge architecture but i have a feeling that perhaps this was the intent of solidly in essence you could have protocol agnostic gauges for anything that requires incentivisation whether it be a particular protocols liquidity can be unilp metapool not tied to the actual exchange gitcoin grants continuous protocol development etc
337364,thats already how it is with curve gauges it is agnostic to what it funds current infra accommodates the amm pools and this additional fundraising gauge for vyperlang theyre getting approx 30k usd a week as funding which they will use to build amazing things in collaboration with trailofbitsbut definitely not limited as people once thought it to be
337365,sure but im also talking about fuse pools created by the rari teamtribedao some of those also use uni twaps right
337366,we provide a twap oracle attack tool for anyone to use at euler oracleeulerfinance it tells you exactly how much it would cost an attacker to move a twap of a given length for a given number of blocks for a given for example to raise the 30 minute twap price of uni by 20 using a 2 block attack would cost 648min contrast it would only cost 185m to perform the same attack on yfi and just 25k to perform the same attack on mimif you want to explore current attack costs quickly we display an oracle rating on appeulerfinance search using the toolbar and hover on the oracle rating to see the current attack costs
337367,how can we send messages with transactions
337368,anywhere we can get a bit more info about this all i see is numbers ser
337369,
337370,that only works afaik because eulers collateralliquidation system is like an auction over time if you need to respond to prices more instantly you cant be using an average
337371,i am no math person can be saying bs apeir99n can help
337372,thanks sers
337373,very cool thanks for the info going to have a dig into the implementation
337374,
337375,this is the vefunder implementation specs are theres a max emisisons beyond which the gauge becomes dry any votes to this gauge thereafter burns crv and theres a receiver address to further append to this logic the receiver address could be a contract that calls crv minter contract and distributes inflation with its own arbitrary logic
337377,vezza95 see here for more info
337379,heres an example on our ui you can hover over the oracle rating and see some estimates for attack costs you can do this even for markets that arent listed on euler just search for them in the search bar and providing they have an active weth pair market on uni v3 and are present in the coingecko token list you can see roughly what it might cost
337381,im curious how do you figure nour should have fixed these attack vectors i have a feeling you might not understand how this attack workedthough it must be said to counter nours earlier point that huge liquidity pools would have made this significantly more difficult andor costly so there is a silver lining after all
337383,what are the protocols that allow you to take a loan against yieldbearing instruments there is abracadabra for sure i feel like i heard of others
337384,think fiatdao offers this
337385,only fixed interest assets
337386,max is working on launching the fe
337387,in a curve 3 pool how little of 1 token can it have before its a problem
337388,
337389,so is this basis trade as larry says or rug
337390,i think with 4pool proposal most of ust and frax folks are missing the main point of algo stables the aim is replace centralize parties like usdc and usdt to have better stable currency which is defi native defi has already been risking with more inclusion of centralized stables isnt a 3pool with dai ust and frax better for the ecosystem as whole than current 4pool
337391,not sure how verifiable it is but alameda is famous for their delta neutral farming tbh so i wont be surprised if its true
337392,they tend to just be delta neutral with hyped stuff later borrow the underlying and nuke on spot while closing longs
337393,they are market maker not charity worker
337394,did i mention charity anywhere
337395,frax and terra are not going to work with maker when they dont collaborate to provide incentives
337396,i think usdc usdt arent providing any incentives so should it even matter like maker can enable the curve lp token of daiustfrax as new collateral type if needed
337397,no it shouldnt incentives are temporarily tools for adoption
337399,defo basis trade imo
337400,so maker can continue getting a free lunch
337401,no it can improve the liquidity for other algo stables how its a free lunch
337402,4p could do it too and liquidity providers get more benefits
337403,does this work with negative values
337404,it is nigh unlikely someone selling as decentralized anything with a straightface is genuinely missing that point
337405,no i totally get that frax is majorly backed by usdc but isnt it just more risky by lping with usdc instead of dai
337406,true but the reliance on usdc usdt doesnt go away
337407,
337408,the man lost it
337409,makes coin pumpu greed bad kill shortsellers
337410,was this proven though
337411,you can save about 60 by bribing vecrv directly compared to votium bribes its a wellkept secret but you need to do some digging to figure it out abra curve and convex are masters of this dark art
337412,nono i mean he is saying greed is bad while doing ponzis
337413,the model is same as terra when terra only had luna collateral
337414,pretty sketchy proposal though
337415,ill post this here becsuse there are many influencers and protocol operators here how does this strengthen defi we have already seen how regulators are putting the screws to centralized exchanges in their quest to ban unhosted walletswe have ust being backed by btc but in a centralized manner and tge 4 pool omits truly decentralized assets in favor of driving higher usdc dominance so no one thinks getting further in bed with circle is bad news for permissionless finance
337416,i think most people in here agree with you
337417,it doesnt need to specifically strengthen the defi ethos as long as it keeps the narrators of this story rich they will narrate accordingly
337418,nothing but the utmost respect for both teams especially frax but something about the whole btc ust and ust frax and all of these things are starting to sound a little too big to fail to me
337419,why arent the frax team incentivizing a pool containing lusd its struggling to gain adoption and could use a leg up
337421,
337422,ser afaik curve is fully onchain gov this must be some weird mental pleb post
337423,sorry if i am wrong
337424,tend to agree yes
337428,since we talking about stables my entire net worth is in lusd farming because i was under assumption that its as pure as colombian cocaine just eth no governance very safe blz confirm
337429,i would post the 50 50 gif but this a gif free space
337430,anyhow the curve thing is pretty cool and shows how far crypto has gotten
337431,and how good curve is
337432,confirmed just eth cant be stopped i use lusd exclusively for that reasonjust wish the masters of the cfi movement ust frax etc incented its use ust relying on centralized btc reserves no bueno those assets can be seized afaik
337433,im 100000 all for censorship resistance and decentralization so will support any asset i feel is doing that
337434,
337435,
337436,
337437,damn booooi
337438,check above kind ser
337439,haha mezcal
337440,i love tequila but comn man
337441,usdn seems to have lost peg possibly due to the recent fud i wonder if that is the motive behind this vote
337442,people exiting the pool due to the fud
337443,not looking great but usdn should recover imo
337444,yield also going higher because less people in the pool 21
337445,hey lobs anybody got some ressources for password strength regarding the difference of a password of uppercasenormal letters with numbers and special characters in comparison to a 35 word i only find government info to this and this makes me sceptical
337446,the answer is always it depends
337447,but a five word password is generally going to be easier for you to remember and have at least equivalent security to a memorable jumble of symbols etc
337448,obviously a password of equivalent length but with 100 random characters has more entropy
337449,but you are a human and cannot remember a 25 character long string of completely random garbage
337450,so just memorize a six word bip39 seed and call it a day
337451,yeah thats the issue im having i wanna use passeord manager and mfa so i can use strong passwords for my logins but if i use strong password for the manager i may forget it and loose access so in theory it would make sense to me to use it for the master password but i guess wordlist attacks would make it easy to crack but since secret phrase for wallets seem to work fine for now i guess its feasable enough thanks for the input bip39 was a good searchterm
337452,i find myself needing to do dd on someone who claims to have worked with andre on something any chance anyone can help me reach andre for a reference check
337453,it someone says they worked with andre its a 99 scam andres semifrens never say they worked with andre
337454,this one is legit in every other way tradfi checks out mostly and other defi xp but larping as andre collaber would be a dealbreaker so just need a yes is ok vs yes not ok vs no really and it is for an executive role so kinda important
337455,dm me i can try but no promise ser
337456,leave the old man be
337457,need a google form to submit questions
337458,like a confession room in church
337459,i can point you towards one his collaborators who he pointed me towards a while back send dm
337460,no clue if theyd know this person but he referred me to them when i offered to help out with solidly back in january
337461,
337462,good read twittercomofficer_ciastatus1510610066378043395
337463,yeah he would surely just admit lol
337464,i took a look at the waves dudes twitter feed and immediately disregarded everything he said
337465,matches 200 to total scammer
337466,same as from 2017 or different
337467,i think both of them worth each other tbh
337468,people defending alabama like he is some altruist lol he is no different waves however introduced the algo stable coin ponzi before luna but somehow its hated and korean ponzi is good
337469,paper from june 2021
337470,i mean the concept architecture
337471,in order to prevent price manipulation i propose price manipulation
337472,its a battle for oi sasha is mm of waves
337473,he is lying about that they are not selling waves lol then who the f sell it
337474,trying to liquidate alameda so later he can nuke it himself
337475,why are people pretending that this waves rally is anything else but an average altcoin exit pump it deserves to be shorted and fudded like all the others
337476,its perpetuals pump actually
337477,do you think this could be the answer to the recent eu shenanigans for regulated crypto exchanges operating in europe
337478,massive spike in oi some weird upbit spot volume idk why and how it came they usually buy tops but this time was trully different people kept shorting waves because everyone kinda knows its total shitcoin
337479,which created even more fuel for continous pumps
337480,yeah but whatever it is its not driven by anything sustainable or worth defending
337481,absolutely
337482,people just should not pick a side here because its like 2 dogs barking on each other
337483,crypto folk love to follow the latest messiah
337484,its really an eye opening experience to watch psychologically
337485,yeah for me too while i know alameda has used many psyops technics before this is one is interesting to watch they already nuking waves as we speak but funding goes heavy negatie again indeed an interesting situation
337486,nan
337487,nan
337488,was about to post this
337489,doing better huh
337490,was same as usdn resrves a week ago
337491,because last week it lost peg
337492,mim
337493,now usdn lost peg
337494,soo ehh who do we need to bribe to get this show on the road before the eu go full crazy mode
337496,
337497,crypt0moon u still finding those
337498,i unfortunately dont
337499,usdn has much lower a 100 vs 2000 so the reckage is quite realalso wen mim pool a ramping down a2000 feels like a bad joke
337500,mim recovered
337501,usdn shall recover as well
337502,overlyhigh a is supposed to be used for veryveryvery correlated assets with the price difference of a few basis points mim has proven to be at least more volatile than that and thus lower a is warranted imo
337503,well which tokenschains have something sustainable expect eth then
337504,definitely not exit pump waves is here for 6 years and not going to exit obviously
337505,i dont mean as in exit scam but exit liquidity as in the party who created this rally taking profit
337506,ah gotcha
337507,and this exit liquidity can also be used just by big waves holders as everyone else would have to wait for the swap for up to 7 days
337508,many of these hot new super liquid curve pools just feel like houses of cards
337509,so i keep reading the erc 1155 spec but i think im missing something ownership of an erc 1155 nft appears to be only emitted as a log event its not actually stored on chain contracts cant read logs events so theres no way from within the evm to determine whether an address owns an erc 1155 nft or who the owner of a given erc1155 nft is this would also mean any transfer of an erc1155 nft would have to be performed by a trusted intermediary which the erc docs refer to as the operator address the operator can freely transfer any nft managed by the erc1155 contract to any address they want but that also implies that any user who owns an erc1155 nft would have to get the contract operator to transfer their nft on their behalf you dont actually own the nft the contract operator does and they can take it away from you at any time i tried googling and it seems like nobody talks about this why do people even consider erc1155 to be web3 or even a real nft for that matter its literally a permissioned database published to a chain
337510,you can use balanceof for ownership
337511,
337512,gud project
337513,thanks
337515,does anyone have any experience with buying vc bags at a premium im looking to buy celestia aha
337516,doesnt look like a problem now usdn and mim were both fud campaign depegs not collateral issues hard to sim this
337517,is decentralized credentialing the next oracle problem
337518,wdyt what would be the next big narrative in a crypto space weve seen defidefi summer of 2020 nfts2021 alt l1ssollunaavax 20202021 daosolympus and forks midlate 2021 whats next
337519,maybe leveragestructured products of sortslike leveraged option on ribbondopex vaults
337520,dao tooling maybe
337521,a more trustworthy name behind leveraged looping stablecoin yields than abracadabra general public is looking to beat inflation
337522,hey guys thank for sharing amazing stuff and i learned alot in the few weeks ive been lurking in hereis there any articles on governance methods currently being used in defi that you recommend my knowledge is very scattered in this area
337524,not sexy enough to be narrative worthy
337526,whats that
337528,gonna be a no from me dog
337530,dao tools narrative is long gone
337531,ser blz soon my bag full launch
337532,
337533,no competetion allowed we can have only one ponzi to be fair fud on waves did much more impact than fud on luna which is why i believe luna is fair winner in this ponzi game
337534,if few days fud can depeg your stable coin it isnt even worth it
337535,ive been following this trend for some time last year and not much happened on this field mostly it was disappointing so i dont think its ready to be a narrative yet that being said i like what royal backed by a16z is doing when you buy nft you buy a percentage of future income from streaming this song and higher tiers nfts get things like backstage pass and so on not a shill since they dont have a token yet
337536,
337537,i think waves did this by their own that vires proposal is a total joke fud initially didnt do even 1 as much as the stupidity of that proposal
337538,was this discussed here is matic really that ambiotious and can execute
337539,ambitiousexecute you mean if they find enough finished products they can buy with their treasury possible
337540,yeah agree completely breaking trust
337542,im finding it hard to separate polygon tech acquisitions from live networksare any of these other ones currently deployable either on testnet or a mainnet
337543,can i just reply with he doesnt know
337544,stargate kicking off omnichain
337545,alt l1s with rollups
337546,they also have the new id product using zk which i thought was pretty cool and is not mentioned here but will be a core component at improving dapp ux
337548,any lobsters attending devconn events next week in amsterdam
337549,what do you mean by leveraged optionsoptions backed by other optionsstablecoins backed by dov shares
337553,couple of big ones coming this month testnet
337554,yes attending daoist and ethamsterdam too
337556,imotokenized business ownership tokenized stocks tokenized social channel shares for investments and revenue distributionstablecoins for esp algos with deliberate designs fully collateralized with decentralized crypto such as liquity semicollateralized as fraxlow prob but huge impact cases of bitcoin use for the international trade between sanctioned countries
337558,during periods of great crisis countries sometimes start trading with gold bitcoin can be used instead in case of severe problems with usd
337559,interoperability
337560,renbtc
337561,binance will delist hegic renbtc and susd on 20220411
337562,like gro dao
337563,isnt molly still working on hegic why
337564,you know where to go soon
337565,awesome will be cool to get a lobster meetup at the event if theres more people hoping on getting a daoist ticket as well
337566,ivangbi enjoyed the ama it felt like a job interview as some points but overal very useful i wish the host engaged more with your answers
337567,good morning guys apologies if this question is very basic in comparison on some of the knowledge bouncing around herei am trying to familiarise myself with solidity where might i search for a comprehensive look at the openzeppelin erc20 implementations i understand what the contract does but i have got myself in a right mess with regards to unit testing approvals spend limits etc in a local env hardhat and most code your first contract only covers transfer mint burnthank you for your time
337568,hello lobsterdao we are a research team from the university of innsbruck and we are conducting a research about daos we would like to get in touch with the modadmin team to discuss in more detail could you please advise
337569,how many lobster nfts needed to interview ivan
337570,120
337571,hello i assume you should get in touch with ivangbi we have a short historical article might help you telegraphlobsterprop0112 as well
337572,120 to compensate for the lobs that were lost forever
337574,
337575,oh wow
337576,good afternoon can anyone link to the original nft lobster dao thanks
337577,the algorithm is coming in sers
337578,
337579,thx
337580,very powerful thanks
337581,ssi is the next big thing to hit defi
337582,peace peace at last
337583,rough since when binance delist anything
337584,isnt susd pretty popular
337585,hegic is absolute dogshit to be fair
337586,sir
337587,may be havent looked into it since it first launched but still there is utter dog shit ghost chains with no teams no devs no prospects and barely any volume still listed thats why i say rough
337588,just random thoughts derivative types and capitalenergy efficiency more apy circumventing the censorship and gov restrictions while protecting from laundering and terr funding maybe incentivized researcheffective altruism havent seen much of it but would love to bridging crypto with real world seamlessly for wider adoption wisdom of the crowds andor manactorpowered decision networks but thats bonkers yeah
337589,one click strategy on arbitrum try it before you hate it
337590,they have been delisting quite regularly for a while now it is mostly about volume projects that do not turn volume take care of market making get delisted to them its probably simply about maintenance cost
337591,too complex to become a narrative you have to think 30 iq points dumber at the minimum
337592,molly did burn a lot of unvested tokens maybe some belonged to cz
337593,yes we told them its not good for our ecosystem if users have a way to circumvent ren bridging fees didnt wanna supply liquidity to something that doesnt work in our favor
337594,games that are played by people who arent doing it to make money attempts at nonusd stablecoins inspired by this sort of stuff omnichainon a bit shorter timeframe i figure lunaust will be driving their own little narrative for a while
337595,maybe start the cycle again revolution
337596,you mean buy btc
337597,is it true that the lobster dao hasnt distributed all of the nft
337598,i meant the cycle that sneg55 mentioned but why not btc to kick it off
337599,saw lots of small projects listed for market making on however it turns out its not that popular
337601,correct dao owns it there is multisig and a lot more stuff please check lobsterdao for all nft collection questions
337602,doesnt ivanov have a 9 figure treasury and more that he can just use to up the peg back do the kwon play
337603,hopefully
337604,key here is that the redemption mechnism changed making it less easy to arb when usdn depgs add to that the vires drama
337605,could you tldr
337606,basically the peg came back in the past cause you could take usdn redeem for 1 worth of waves 24h random period i believe and arb it out very close to luna model at the start btw now you have to hold another token nsbt to do so which obv complicates thing this is well described in this thread
337607,swapping is available only for owners of gnsbt nsbt stakersforcing arbitrageurs to hold more of their tokens before they can arbi
337608,yes
337609,less than 10k and u get 2x over 1mm and u get 50x
337610,broken system imo
337611,my view is that they should roll back to the previous arbing mechanism which has proven to be working in the past especially in a period of stress sucks for nsbt stakers who prob front ran this but is oke considering whats at stake more broadly
337612,hey lobsters does anyone have standing issues with the formatting used by etherscan for smart contracts im aware of1 how we handle commas in the read contract output treated as a line break2 monospace issue with source code ascii art nows the time to bring them up
337613,the gate was a feature not a bug about the only thing that prevented ust from triggering a downward spiral like iron in their last depeg may 2021 was their gate the limited amount of ust that could be swapped into luna resulted in a temporary 10 discount but it prevented a selfreinforcing mintingdumping of luna which was what did titaniron in
337614,frens is there any lib in python to create eth address private key gotta generate a thousand of addresses that can function as mm
337615,pywallet
337616,is it not btc onlysorry im retarded found it all g
337621,i feel your pain remember the case where metaverse project got 100k usdc investment sent on wrong chain where multisign wasnt deployed and i got my monthly wage stuck for 2 months because i accidentally sent it on polygon instead of bsc for cashout ser to avoid sending erc20 tokens to the wrong address wrong blockchains or to the smart contract address by mistake usdt smart contract alone has wrongly sent 13m on it we made a little tool that perhaps might be useful for someone besides mebasically instead of sending erc20 directly by calling transfer and hoping the address was right you do erc20approve first and send the recipient link to call transferfrom if the recipient indeed controls the address they complete the transfer if not you can cancel the approval
337625,hello lobs excuse me hope newbish questions are still allowed ive seen some articles how bsc validators sell blocks but lost emcant you help finding materials about that even on other blockchains
337626,why renbtc whats up
337627,
337628,wow so it was your decision
337629,usdn pump
337630,lol
337631,wrapped bitcoin belongs in defi anyway
337632,found that hope it helps your researches
337633,just try nodereal service hehe
337635,
337636,sry if slightly off allowed topics and no arm chair legal discussions just think this is v relevant as stablecoins will be recognised as form of payment
337637,ill be there as well
337639,me sir
337640,anyone recall the name of the protocol whos founder prop traded their eth ico proceeds and was short eth at the bottomi want to think its electroneum but its not
337641,awesome guys lets organize a meetup there as i see enough people that will be around for a lobster secret after party
337642,exchange rate usdndai including fees 07984
337644,substratum ico
337645,cheers
337648,what are metis fees like
337650,34 weeks ago it was around 2 if i remember correctly
337651,metis is optimism fork
337653,
337654,ive been pretty off but id guess lobster have already discussed nusd searched for this tweet in the group and didnt find it
337655,but jfc that is just a desperate and sad move
337656,imagine supporting that blockchain lel
337658,a bit random but is there any timestamp as latest block in the form of a qr code appwebsite out there ie you go to lastblockdotcom and shows a qr code of the latest tx hashes of your favorite blockchain
337659,kind of looking for a hold todays newspaper equivalent in crypto
337660,details or link please
337661,
337662,i just shat my own pants
337663,pics or it didnt happan
337664,someone shat mine can send for verification dunno who though
337665,so who are those publicly known multisig members now
337666,they cant stop misleading people since their horrible retroactive airdrop
337667,is usdn ded
337668,openzeppelin security research team along with convex anonymous developers agreed that the best course of action to this dilemma was to incorporate additional publicly known parties to the multisig making a rugpull impossiblehow
337669,basically oz like to embellish stories
337671,did you have to go from an anon signer to now a public one they let you keep the same wallet or no meme
337672,has anyone used thought about or read about the usage of a nft to represent private equity
337674,oz were unprofessional in the way they handled the discovery process their article is also misleading
337675,the multisig wasnt fully anonymous either so thats also a lie
337676,just reads like clickbait written by some confused marketer
337677,did i miss something or is the only thing that changed adding a public person or persons to the multisig
337678,strange article if so
337679,that was also after the convex dev team had to uncover the vulnerability themselves because oz wouldnt disclose because they are anonymous
337680,that article leaves a lot unsaid
337681,oh damn wanna see some oz member reply proper shit huh
337682,maybe buy low sell high binance users fed up being exit liquidity for hegic stakers
337683,that article title was bs click bait crap
337684,yeah its stupid
337685,lost any respect i had for them dealing with their team
337686,do u mind if i link twitter to this convo or you prefer not to surface things that much so much virtue signaling there
337687,go for it
337688,giant balls respect ser
337689,i have very much ser
337690,nft would be a useful vehicle for private equity where voting rights dont correspond to profit share eg your 20 company share grants you only 5 of voting rights or as much as 80 otherwise regular tokens could be used total share capital is 100 tokens if you have 1 you can have any particular 1 token it doesnt have to be a specific one
337691,i mean is a little bit clicky baity but from those steps if post is to be trusted which i assume we can they could rug pull it
337692,and that should not be even possible
337693,sweet can i dm you
337694,please do
337695,see fairmintco
337696,
337697,have heard of them but havent heard from them in a while
337698,for matic holders recreational apers
337699,only for matic on ethereum or also on polygon l2
337700,stake on ethereum lp on polygonor just buy on polygon balancer and lp there
337701,was using polygonscancom or something before and it was working just fine switched to this and my transacitons are queued for half an hour already
337702,q im trying to auction an nft on opensea i already have a os contract depolyed and gave os permissions for the collection now its asking for unlimited weth permissions altho i dont own any in this address is this last step legiti think auctioned off something on a different address without giving it asking for weth permissions
337703,just a general understanding question my head cant comprehend why wouldnt every protocol join the curve wars as long as bribes earningsisnt it effectively free moneyapy for either the treasury andor holders lping what do i miss here
337704,cause some protocols just dont gain anything from having too deep of liquidity books it doesnt make them revenue
337705,isnt a emission bribe that the protocol itself would collect somewhat a positive revenue stream
337706,but emissions for what they just go to lps that doesnt achieve much then anyway this is too vague of a context for stablecoins probably likely ye what else tho
337707,protocol owned liquidity lp treasury bribe collect emissions sell increase treasury rinse repeat
337708,take a step back ser what exactly are you achieving you are not bringing in more pol but just more lp unless i missed your point
337709,i dmed you maybe my head is really just burning and crashing right now
337710,do treasuries come with the other thing that needs to be paired
337711,actually ok fair enough
337712,our brains are melting what r we missing it cant be that trivial
337713,nan
337714,why you leaked it
337715,
337716,i mean it cannot be this easy
337717,unless that is what samkazemian is bamboozling us with w do kwon
337718,someone is already rushing to create shitcoin lol
337721,is the bribing interface permissioned and voters wont see our pool does curve turn such off is the whitelisting quorum so high its too expensive to do itcharlie_eth my iq is too low please tell me this is mot infinite money machine i feel so dumb
337722,uponly
337729,isnt that what mochi did
337731,well no they made an actual project and then printed off fake collateral here you dont even need to print or make something to sell you just lp with your own money like solidly case
337732,even if somebody buys ur stable with a high a parameter pool you can then just sell the fake stable same way and if nobody buys u collect premium
337733,maybe i missinterpreted
337734,the roosh case ser
337735,to put it simply
337736,these are the steps of the attack
337737,its a bit more complex but similar to mochis case
337738,gauges arent permisionless on curve
337739,ahhhhh okok good solved case then
337740,needs to get it past the dao
337741,no but they are permisionlesslike if you hold a shit ton of crv
337742,steff_bullishkid u aint gonna be rich
337743,ofc you have the emergencydaomsig in place for those cases
337744,so only mich can rug us
337745,yeah
337746,ill send you your part of the lp back in a bit
337747,praise the almighty mich
337749,thank got its not permissionless
337751,its rather what frax does somewhat collect more emissions then you pay in bribes
337752,not really
337753,its the same situation as solidly we all know the outcome for a protocol is painful when users try to rug emissions in trap pools
337754,because frax does it that way only because convex exists
337755,they couldnt replicate the same with curve alone
337756,i just wanted to take some of that curve printing is that so sinful _ thanks for pointing it out ser all clear
337757,dont worry gearbox surely goes through the dao
337758,what is the tldr on that how am i being bamooozled this time
337759,lmfao
337760,i love crypto
337761,i dont disagree frax isnt doing so different from this but they are playing by the rules
337762,that you wouldnt be able to gain access to 60 of the supply of crv if you want to buy it you would send the price to the moon
337763,but you can hold a big chunk of the cvx supply bribe yourself to vote on your pool and then have 50 of the 60 crv supply to vote on you
337764,ok so who robbed us this time
337765,so same just with more capital and a bit mixed through d
337766,why am i poor and you are poor and bk is poor who is rich then
337767,no one they just play the game at the highest degree of chadness
337768,gauges need to be whitelisted by the dao and can be shut down by emergencybros
337769,you three are rich
337770,0800daddymitch
337771,ivan made crying about being poor in public cool
337772,the larpoor
337773,i think the gender distribution in the emergencybros is skewed towards males this is bad for defi
337774,ive seen other curve core devs do the same tho
337775,i probably live in a rented apartment owned by one of core curve devs
337776,big if true true if big
337777,and every conference you go to
337778,rich guy
337779,nan
337780,how to fix
337781,how do i get into curve core team
337782,lmao
337783,i can do about nothing but will laugh at jokes
337784,i recruit for julien
337785,bunny gender reveal time
337786,just slap curvefinance core team on your twitter bio bro
337787,he has 4 other companies
337788,stakedao stake capital blackpool and rekt
337789,what if i dont have twitter because i find it cringe
337791,just fix some typos on curves repo
337792,larp corplies foundationbamboozle llcand bouterlarp capital
337793,youd love tweetdao
337794,wanted to join wonderland devs ended up with sifu cant get it right ever
337795,lmao damn
337796,hes a good dude
337797,oh i do i paid 2k to tweet
337798,sifu saved me
337800,questionable financial decisions everyday
337801,i can fix electrical sockets
337802,this group is poorly moderated i gotta say
337803,if only admins were around
337804,thats because ive been offline for the past 6 months
337805,yeah right
337808,ok fun stop or daddy will rug your gauge good night
337809,ivan has been forking around compound
337811,please let me be funny i dont have anything else good going on in my life
337812,its ok you have the egg now
337813,its relaxing to shitpost
337814,fin removing further fun
337817,blz ser no more fun need my gauges
337818,is there any way to remove spam tokens from ones wallet
337819,2 for a swap or simple send
337820,
337821,for a swap it was 0014573125 metis 250 simple tx i also had for 0000072588 metis 007cheaper than i remembered
337822,best not to interact with them and ignore if you transfer them chances are youre approving something you shouldnt
337823,i havent interacted with it just wanted to know if theres a way to remove said tokens
337824,to remove means to set your balance to 0 which requires some kind of transfer or burn if token is erc20applicableas they are most likely malicious the transfer method might contain something alongside with actual transfer it is unlikely that another token will be approved to attacker as modern erc20 approval implementations eg from openzepp checks msgsender which eliminates possibility of being called not explicitly by user but better not to interact or double check the contracts transfer or burn method once youre sure in underlying codebase transfer them out or burnstill better to seek ui solutions to hide those tokens eg mms assets list can be modified
337825,thanks for this
337828,jchervinsky retweeted __ some good news for defi bad news for garygensler in a case against binance last week a judge ruled that binance didnt have sufficient contacts to be considered operating an unregistered exchange in the us
337829,seems interesting although im confused as to how the deposit apy is calculated seems to me to be variable depending on the utilization of each pool
337830,is it possible to hide the interaction with the blockchain network and send just with one click now we have to manually swtich between different networks
337831,
337832,i assume this was an error
337833,i forget why this happens but yea its an error
337834,em didnt get it whats the error
337835,guessing the part where it costs almost a full eth to do that
337836,nan
337837,hey guys sorry to bother you i have been hacked all my usdc from my metamask i have the tx hash and the wallet of the hacker any idea if incan manage to do something
337840,hope it doesnt bother yall would be curious to know your guess
337841,second tweet says its heavily overcollateralized 240 does anyone have the info whats the total liquidity for waves token during redemption event people unlikely would like to keep waves that would be heavily dumped by other traders so natually i would expect exchaning waves for something more fundamental like btceth whats the total of such fundametal assets are overall in the econsystem of waves im not trying to fud dont have any motivation to do so curious purely in numbers and methodology of calcs these numbers specifically because ust has the same model as usdn
337842,usdn waves redemptions happen in the smart contract without any link to orderbookscentralized exchanges the only thing is a mark price based on the main wavesusdt pairs
337843,so even if tomorrow the overcollateralization drops to for example 120
337844,that would not directly have an impact on wavesusdt nor would it impact traders as such
337845,its just swaps that get triggered and get executed over a random time period 24h
337846,smart contract essentially plays orderbook
337847,not sure if that answers your question
337848,i think its now instant but you need an obscene amount of nsbt to do any meaningful arbitrage hence the tweet by inal about changing parameters to allow more arbitrage
337849,can check some stats here for the smart contract
337850,yeah thats an issue
337851,i think if thats addressed properly itll just balance itself out
337852,yes they changed to the new system just in time for this storm lol
337853,it was meant to centralize the process but now it looks like just an idiotic decision since no1 can arbitrage
337854,it was meant to counter arbitrage that abused the curve pool iirc but it countered all arbitrage
337855,any fud related to a permanent depeg event is just unsubstantial in no way will there not be enough collateral to back usdn
337856,as long as they fix the usability of the bridge itself
337857,q how do i find the most profitable path on a dex without using the ui1 look at the existing token pairs for the initial token2 map out probable paths3 query those paths to find the most profitableor is there a optimal path function
337859,dijikstras algorithm is a good place to start
337860,if you were referring to uniswap they are using a heuristic method the code is pretty readable also if just wanna use their sdk they have some docs
337861,thanks will have a look
337864,nan
337865,
337876,is it okay if i share a project here i dont wanna shill its not a pd they got a grant from the european union and its led by researchers and artists so kinda no defi no moon no nothing but imo what they do is interesting and id be curious to collect feedbacks
337881,appchain crosschain
337883,like dfk mainnet or imx
337884,yes
337885,l1 is exhausted
337886,l2 appchain will blow up
337887,after that crosschain narrative
337888,my brains will blow up
337889,we barely know about appchain
337890,but i think it will be a narrative
337891,we could call dydx is an appchain
337892,fat protocol thesis is not true
337893,
337894,dydx earned hundreds million
337895,but you could see how much it paid for eth
337896,would you consider all those parachains in dotsama ecosystem appchain
337897,yes sir
337898,avax subnet atom dot
337899,we could call them appchains
337900,osmosis dex appchain
337901,acala defi appchain
337902,avax subnet seems to be the lowest cost appchain atom needs connect to ibc dot needs a lot of money to becoming its parachain
337903,lmao i could be banned by ivangbi for flushing
337904,nah is okay u fine ser
337905,when dapps become bigger i think they will have their own chain for sure
337906,
337907,i dont think app chain will be the thing i think itll be app agnostic but optimized chains that natively bridge
337908,i never understood why polkadot auctions off slots and allows for those parachains to become pretty close to app specific instead of launch a large amount of interconnected common goods chains
337909,let me know of anyone wants to hire a smart contract developer erc20 or erc721
337910,benefits for being an appchain
337911,appchains allow developers to customize their applications in terms of governance structure economic design and underlying consensus algorithmeach appchain is a selfgoverned economy with codedefined explicit processes to reach agreements on protocol upgrades
337912,cosmosibc is the future
337913,like dfk subnet they solve jewel inflation problem
337914,yeah agreed but i just dont see how having one chain per app will scale vs having more common optimized chains for example dfk they dont need their own chain they just need a gaming optimized one low decentralizatin high transaction throughput
337915,but if we somehow figure out highly reliable highly secure highly fast and easy to use bridges then id agree with you i definitely dont see that happening though
337916,this relates to blockchain trilemma l1 couldnt handle a dapp they need to find scaling solution
337917,so they become an appchain
337918,nah not necessarily for example on dot you can have one parachain with super low collator count effectively accomplishing the same without needing to build bridges etc
337919,how about security problem with appchain all validator are from 1 team
337920,if you allow app specific then the parachain slots just gets used up by a bunch of random projects that might not go anywhere
337921,i made a thread here it fits some of the ct topos aka it might have quite a few degens part but that is not the core hopefully it sums things well and give a good first glance at what they do leveraging crypto and nfts to design an economy that a undermine the funding issues in tradart and b question the act of collecting live art at the end of the thread theres the github and the docs links i leave this as an introduction and id be really happy to collect any feedbacks youd be willing to share i really like the guys because they seem to be well aware of their need to be in a position where they listen and take feedbacks into account and they genuinely wanna meet new minds and new mindsets kinda cool
337922,dont punch me if i made typos on the thread ahah frenchies ans english long story
337923,this sounds like building your own game engine to make a game or worse an os just to make an app
337924,question to the eth20l2 expertsthere are several l2s with their own fees tokens metisbobaniiwill they be able to become eth20 shards or not and only true optimistic rollups arbitrumoe are able to
337925,i dont know we need a time to see it
337926,they are doing well like osmosis dydx dfk
337927,agreed also i question how many differently optimized chains you need to build games on certainly there must be some level that makes sense
337928,do we theres nothing unique or unprecedented here the only people that think app devs are interested in faffing around with consensus and the like just to make an app are people selling the socalled app chains
337929,but now we gotta verify and audit chain code not just smart contracts
337930,oh the claim is coming
337931,i will delegate to u ivan
337932,no i will vote to exit the dao and give me the money
337933,sounds good how much will you pay out to delegators
337934,what does it mean when alameda research says they provide market making services is it essentially they buy a good portion of the supply and makes continuous buys and sells so essentially they are always the top bid and ask in the orderbook
337935,not top but close they just maintain a tight spread so that larger orders can happen without moving the market too much also prevents massive abritrage oppose where one scamware cex depegs from another that actually has volume well in reality they arb it but yeah
337936,okay so do they do only one side like is it possible that a service only provides liquidity for the sells while letting the buys be more volatile
337937,that you have to ask them even if they decide to tell you in the first place its all very opaque it also depends if they work for you and require notional capital for thenother side of the book or use their own like wintermute what the time period and profit split of their engagement is what they directionally think of an asset usually you cant mm what you invest in but its just semantics basically you wont find what you are looking for if you are trying to deduct their behavior from their sheer involvement mms are not magic
337938,mm means providing a spread ask and bids it takes both to make a market
337939,here is the playbook they get lent tokens to mm which is fine they carry some risk and get the spread now they also usually get given a free option to receive tokens in say 6month if price is k
337940,quite interesting thanks
337941,now this sounds like a dumb question but we can think of various protocols as offering smart contracts as a service scaas uniswap provides scaas in the form of permissionless liquidity pools where anyone can deploy in any combination of 2 erc20 tokensgnosis safe provides scaas in a proxy implementation where new proxy contracts deployed created all point to the same canonical gnosis safe interface contract that contains all the logic that is needed for transactions what would be some reasons why there are two different forms of how people can deploy your smart contracts what would happen if uniswap used a proxy implementation for its liquidity pools instead
337942,hey guys my name is jeremy bragin i am a film producer currently working on the docuseries for one of russias largest vod platformsim looking to connect with the lobsterdao team can we possibly get in touch
337943,
337944,thank you
337945,you ve knocked at the right door ivangbi is a great builder of narratives
337946,seen this elsewhere over 10k txs ridiculous lolmaybe etherscan can add a hide valueless token txs button or something
337950,hackernews apple neglects to patch two zeroday wild vulnerabilities for big sur catalina
337951,why is gas like 4k gwei
337952,stop minting nfts for your grams man
337953,gary vee nft shittery
337954,1 max shittery
337955,past 5m has somehow burnt 16k eth thanks i guess
337956,based gary attack
337957,veefriends
337958,his little bros sports nft thing
337959,gary vee is a scammer sharlatan
337960,
337961,protip if gas is high you can just check on ultrasoundmoney i dont wanna say his scammy stuff here
337962,my apologies
337964,fear ivan not me
337965,thanks i thought its the other initiative gary vee co seem to be enjoying their time with nfts
337966,what a scammy rug wow
337967,yo peeps whats the most cost effective way to get access to an eth node without running my own to read data from the blockchain need to be able to serve peaks of traffic of a few tens of thousands of users at peak times im being told that using infura or alchemy will rack me up thousands in fees what about using other rpcs i essentially need a provider for when users dont have metamask havent connected just yet
337968,quicknode perhaps
337969,if you need access to archive node
337970,what are your opinions on creating community owned etherscan alternative
337971,its super complex stuff requires constant maintaince hard to monetize basically the worst thing to do probably
337972,no archive node needed
337973,thats an art wdym
337974,huge infrastructure cost without easy plan for monetization that will work for community based project
337975,nan
337976,daaamn im glad i asked will postpone thinking about this thank you
337977,most products give the data away for free thus a very high bar and hard to build a unique angle
337978,
337979,only 458 remain vsp passes thankfully this bs is almost over
337981,during dev connect in amsterdam does lobsterdao want to do a private boat party
337982,uh yaha
337983,just make sure the boat has a roof the weather hasnt exactly been amazing
337984,wanted to do smth w klibansky but tbh both are busy af and didnt wanna do smth halfassed just for context
337985,has anyone tried using this with the local hardhat node forked mainnet or does it only work with erigon
337986,fairs for those that want to go on any boat seems to have found a big boat for an after party ill shush now
337987,lol vayner sports took the record of burning the most eth in a single block
337988,what a crazy mint
337989,some people in nftutc24 tried to warn them they had to redo the entire contract for minting bc of problems with stealth mint didnt actually hardcap of mints allowed tx address in the code
337990,for two blocks
337991,hahah what a sham
337995,thanks for sharing
337997,
337998,hey folks for anyone going to paris blockchain week im making an events list with messari for all you lobsplease add your listings to the form
337999,is that the erc developed by the rari guys or is it yet another erc
338000,interested to hear everyones thoughts on eip4626
338002,rari yield and yearn but yes
338003,omg
338004,how does the opensea calculate royalties if you sell nfts from different collections in bundle
338005,ivangbi breaking news about your bags
338006,2 other projects how in the world
338007,is there a sp500 stableish coin yet
338008,whats solidly emissions schedule why does supply always show 100m
338009,had that idea back stablecoin with wide index fund such stable is expected to steadily decrease ltv ratio longterm other things being equal which means more and more overcollateralisationmirror has mspy tracking snp but only on terrait also has mqqq tracks nasdaq on both ethereum and terra but the liquidity is not so deep
338010,i also do not mention wellknown points with terra synths
338011,thats indeed 100m but once this is reached you have a tail emission representing 02 of the supply
338012,i was reading through joeys tweet about it and i legit had no idea what he was explaining until yearn said it was a replacement of xsushi needs help w communications to start
338013,turned out revote dot cash works for eth only do you know tool to revoke approve for sidechainsl2
338014,you can use the etherscan equivalents
338015,debank used to do it too and even labeled the different contracts but they moved it to a wallet extension called rabby
338016,i deployed a contract i didnt verify on etherscan and it disappeared from remix so i dont have access to deployer interface i mistanely send 4 eth to wrong contract and it doesnt have any function to take out stuck balance in it its too big amount for me any help will be appreciated
338017,any possible way to get those eth out like any deployed contract with new wallet contract is not of any use just need to get out those funds to deployer wallet back
338018,so the contract wasnt the one you deployed would say no luck then
338019,actually both are good contracts but deployed a contract and thought should go with better one but send eth for liquidity for older contract
338020,can we destroy contract and get funds out of it
338021,only if you have a selfdestruct function within the contract by default itd return the funds to the caller unless you have an address assigned to be the recipient
338022,no it doesnt have self destruct rekt
338023,then its stuck
338024,if you recall the withdraw function name and params you can just call that function
338025,i have 100 supply of tokens
338026,in deployer wallet
338027,then just dump it
338028,its a liquidity contract
338029,no its a token contract that have a function to add liquidity
338030,but i dont even have access to functions as i didnt verify contract
338031,and having issues verifying it tried 10s times
338032,you set the functions to owneronly
338033,its ownable
338034,hmm but there must be a function to remove liquidity
338035,how does verification make a difference here
338036,you dont need to verify contract to have access to functions abi is enough to call any of them
338037,if you remember the name and parameters of that function you could call it raw
338038,without verified interface
338039,he said it dissappeared from remix
338040,exactly
338041,yes
338042,doesnt matter
338043,well he cant do that if he doesnt remember the function names
338044,how can it be recovered
338045,or doesnt have the abi
338046,i have code
338047,oh then youre good
338048,there u go
338049,deployer wallet 0x9865a731d20515d0a93a3320d215561d1ced1e1fcontract address 0x852738d63fffaa2cd0aa3df10edf0184d4ceab2ccode
338051,so get keccak of remove liq function and call it
338052,i am trying to verify contract but cant it fails everytime
338053,you dont need to verify it
338054,i deployed it using remix remix saves any data when we deploy
338055,yeah just call the function to sweep t
338056,maybe can use that
338057,put the code back in remix
338058,and compile it then you
338059,ok its there
338060,just load the address on remix
338061,and call any function you want
338062,ok
338063,just call sweepcontingency then youll get the eth back
338064,it just loads interface antisnipe a part of whole contract
338065,why so
338066,change the contract
338067,to kintoro
338068,like that
338069,thanks
338070,wow
338071,it worked
338072,thanks a lot everyone
338073,no problem
338074,i literally had no hopes
338075,anyone knows where i can get a few hundred ropsten eth
338076,what is hellsing inu
338077,project i am working on we are developing a play to earn game that primarily rewards you in nfts that are usable as gameitems ingame instead of a token thats what i need the eth for
338078,heres a demo of the game if you want an idea how it looks like
338079,hi when convex holders are bribed by fxs to vote for their guage where is the yield if i lockcvx do i still need to vote daily or delegate it
338080,wow this looks so old school hehe multiplayer
338081,i see the point in nfts rewards in game if there is multiplayer competition pvp
338082,spotted a cool tool for daos3twittercom_anishagnihotristatus1511295895760867329
338083,first there will be the solo campaigns we are in a space that needs continuos updates or people think you are not working hard enough but yeah multiplayer is the ultimate goal we have this ingame mechanics called portal where you can essentially type in coordinates and go to multiple worlds within the game these portals would be used to introduce multiplayer system in the game
338084,would be cool something like soulslike invasion style may be if you have bosses haha
338085,i defo like the idea would invest tbh
338086,we do have bosses
338087,thats the hell portal
338088,well we do have a token but i know many people here dont like the idea of taxed tokens we will soon have an nft series where essentially you will have to find the coordinates for the monster by solving ingame puzzles and then defeat a procedurally generated monster to be whitelisted for minting
338089,its crypto man we have token economies everywhere there are people in this group who created way more meaningless tokens and werent judged doing so no token no value you shouldnt worry about that but thats just my opinion
338090,oh yeah for sure but different pitch for different communities though i was not really planning on shilling here heres our website if you want to check us out
338091,this seems like it would really benefit from rmrk nfts its going to be so held back by erc721 looks great cant wait to try all this gaming resurgence is making me miss gaming all the more
338092,we are actually going ahead with erc1155 not erc721 but we are not yet at the stage where we can make a final decision about it if i am not wrong rmrk is on polkadot right
338093,btw if you want to try it out we do have a playable demo at its a bit rough around the edges and have a few bugs but its still fun for a prealpha just dm me an email and i can enable access
338094,we now have evm contracts too in testing and rust pallets in mvp state and currently run in colored coins mode aiming to cover as much ground as possible happy to show you around plenty of games already developing with us one diablo like thing one thing similar to yours single player experience and of course our skybreach thing so happy to explore options for collabing
338095,oh interesting i havent really deep dived into polkadot solutions mostly been concentrating on developing the ecosystem around our own application specific rollup but this definitely intrigues me
338096,hey ivangbi whats the conditions for being eligible to claim
338097,lol thx i actually didnt know i had some gear to claim
338098,and delegate for me cryptojohnbooneeth
338099,were always ready to be paranoidal about too low level of decentralisation in cryptoweb3defi about stablecoins which can be affected by usas decisions usdc about data storage which rely on few centralized products about node networks dependence on centralized infrastructure etcat the same time almost all definative products rely on decentralised governance which means that token holders are the power here but who are the largest token holders of the biggest defiprotocols and how much power do they have brief analysis of ethplorer and snapshot shows this picture just an example for uni aave and dydx 175m8m holdings by one of the biggest token holderaverage number of votes from last proposals for uni 15m250k for aave 25m25m for dydx guess who is this one of the biggest token holder binance at least wallets tagged in ethplorer as binancesas i understand binance as a token holder can participate in governance though usually cexs dont do it but if binance would want to become a malicious actor does he have a power to propose first suspend withdrawals and and stake govtokens if needed vote for a malicious proposal and hurt all defiecosystem if yes shouldnt we look at binance and other cexs like a potential single points of failure in defiworld hope there is a mistake in my logic
338100,ive mentioned this a couple times but i really hope long term crypto moves away from token only voting to a more bicameral system like house and senate one side votes straight tokens one side is 1 vote per unique human i guess there can be some small minimum token requirement too and only things that pass both get passed
338101,obviously that would make decision making even way slower than it already is so i see it more as a board of directors that is elected in the above way maybe even with liquid voting where users can delegate their tokens to the directors
338102,that is kind of how polkadot works right now in some ways but i gotta say i am not loving it
338103,this proposal is interesting in terms of centralizationdecentralization
338104,this works really well in systems with enough validator room but in lowcapacity validator systems not so much as whales then tend to make a bunch of validators and push everyone out
338105,yeah but if you combine this with a random selection of block producer boom you higher decentralization and lower incentives to run many nodes
338106,agree there are a lot of different ways to improve voting system from chosing the way of traditional llc works with board of directors etc to more exotic methods though at this moment im interested in question does the problem i mentioned really exists if yes it looks strange to me that were trying to decentralize and democratize almost everything and again talking about our fear of governments amazon etc but in the same time the whole system can be affected by one person cz
338107,to be clear my system would rely on some sort of a unique personhood thing which doesnt yet exist
338108,theres no personhood voting on dot right its token voting with a board of directors from what i understand can teh technical board actually be replaced by token vote
338109,we really arent democratizing governance we are by definition oligarchizing it for the time being thats likely the best we can do but i 100 believe we need to move forward from that
338110,it is tricameral in theory plebs council and technical committee in practice not reallythere is no proof of personhood and despite us knowing that the people on the council and tech committee are actual unique people this does not really help with regards to technical decentralization or decision making for now
338111,how much is being released internally i mean did it start 100m right away and released 2m to circulation per week or how fast
338112,we are making personhood voting on a substrate chain though biometric consensus layer
338113,ah yeah i guess in my theory plebs would be split into plebs with lots of tokens and plebs with 1 or more tokens
338114,yeah thatd be a super cool basis for a bicameral house and senate type voting system i personally think representative democracy will work better than direct democracy for lower level decision making but i think theres good arguments for both
338115,that is how it works now basically plebs have either few or many tokens and they use those to vote there are some interesting antiwhale mechanics in the voting but the system as a whole is kinda broken right now so it is being revamped
338116,ill have to check it out i didnt realize the nouance thanks
338117,love that they are trying to make progress towards actual democracy seems like everyone else is content with the oligarchy strategy probably because they are the oligarchs
338118,yeah so the pending change that is coming is there will be different tracks councils for different parts of the chains aspects vs one council for everything and one tech committee for everything so ideally the councils will specialize etc
338119,plus antisniping is being added to the proposals not sure how that was not in from day one
338120,ah interesting sounds more like the swiss style of governance where we have 7 presidents in the executive so more of a board of directors and each of them specializes in one of the 7 departments
338121,see dms ser
338122,and i am convinced that we also need a deliberative branch with randomly selected holders
338123,
338124,i think liquid token voting so you can delegate your tokens to other people and redelecte at any time is more likely to be a better outcome very hard to get random people up to speed and youd end up to something similar to us jury trials which arent really known for being particularly consistent
338125,actually research is a bit more nuanced on this
338126,and i think a mixed system of liquid democracy representative deliberative is solid
338127,the goal is to be able to integrate the complexity of human governance into the crypto ream and go beyond what liberal democracies do which is ok but far far from good
338128,not disagreeing with you i was more commenting on that if you have 10 different jurys the exact same trial youd be likely to not end up with 10 consistent verdicts so its more of an issue with how good is the decision quality not with does it engage the public
338129,yeah i can agree to this but when comparing i think its good to compare also with existing mechanism parliaments also have the good habit to come up with 10 different solutions when confronted with the same issue so the question is what of epistemic vs social process do we achieve
338130,and deliberative processes are good at begin epistemic
338131,when working on policial matters
338132,lol very fair point
338133,can you guys recommend a proxy provider for static ips which can be paid with crypto
338134,remind me again the point of this goal is
338136,do you think sending people a piece of paper and then have them all walk to physical location and get them to fill out another paper to throw it into a box is the endgame
338137,do better than previous generations simple isnt it
338138,exactly this is not the endgame
338139,probably not but i dont see what people building software on a supposedly immutable db have to do with that
338140,doing what
338141,i have problems collaborating with frontender implementing dapp based on smart contracts i wrote ie some parameters are not clear something doesnt work etc i created docs but it only partially helps if you ever had this problem how do you guys go about it
338142,living on the planet we have managing the extremely difficult goal of balancing out individual freedom and desire of happiness with common responsibility we have and the planetary boundaries questing for the infinite story of a better governance
338146,lol at least theres some self awareness
338147,most important to have this
338148,i usually just go on a call with people and walk through the different questions with them that either works or it shows you where the trouble in understanding your documentation lies so you can adjust it
338149,i dont think blockchain will ever solve issues related to governance thats like saying that the internet by enabling ease of communication will make people better communicators
338150,it is not meant to solve governance issues but support the process make it more robustverifiableefficient
338151,yeah thats what im doing actually debugging myself at this point because not to badmouth but the dev is not the best i was thinking it would be cool to have a tool that exports a sample projectdocs based on natspec kind of like swagger but for fe where it shows how to call given functions with sample params but at this point its easier just to help
338152,i think this is the trick no tehcnogoly is able to do this but many tech can support a social process
338153,yeah there is not much else you can do if the other party lacks essential skillsknowledge you have to babysittrain or replace them
338154,i know thats what im saying though the rails that facilitate efficiency in governance process cannot solve the issues of governance which are unrelated to the efficiency of governance process it will likely just compound them and make them even more glaringly obvious
338155,depends on the experience level of your frontend dev if he is new to web3 i think i would prefer to give him a typescript wrapper that takes care of setting up the plumbing and exposes an interface that makes it easier to consume on a frontend app
338156,thats really interesting so if i understand correctly ts would wrap the smart contract function calls and expose a typesafe interface that would act as a documentation of sorts i see it working for those completely new in this case its not at that level but will keep the idea in mind
338157,yep exactly you can treat it almost as a blackbox and the separation of concerns in my experience makes the updates to uiux more modular
338158,
338159,
338160,you mean something like typechain or even more wrapped
338161,depends on what you need honestly i generally prefer a bit more wrapped to keep the surface of the interface minimal and only expose stuff that you absolutely need for the frontend but in most scenarios typechain is more than good enough
338162,maybe this is a crazy question but project founders what accounting platform do you use im trending to quick books just because im used to it anything better more crypto out there
338163,ideally something that can ingest transactions from fireblocks
338164,seems interesting are you involved in the consortium
338165,is there a way to make a bid on all items of a specific art blocks collection looksrare allows for a collection bid but here the entirety of art blocks is considered a collection since all pieces come from the same smart contract
338166,what are the defi fixed income projects that currently have most traction or their approach makes most sense
338167,
338168,traction is low for most atm best projects imo tempusfinance elementfi pendlefinance
338169,including apwinefi notionalfinance 88mphapp
338170,thanks not at all im contributing at different levels and i know the founders but thats it
338171,can i have a different eth address pay the debt off on aave for my friends wallet as a gift would like for him to wake up and see his debt cleared out for his birthday
338172,yes with repayjust gotta set the onbehalfof address as the target addr
338173,helllll yeah other people i asked were doubtful ill test it out thanks
338174,cryptio has a fireblocks integration
338175,i spent a long time trying to figure this out pm if you want details
338180,howfast is solidly being released before the 100m supply is reached
338181,oh thats cool def looks like it solves at least part of my issue but was more taking about generic accounting software that produces a pl at the end of the day for an operating company
338182,cryptio syncs with quickbooks otherwise look at bitwave or softledger
338183,awesome thanks
338185,
338186,heyo check out a recap of the top podcasts of march via the link below
338187,thanks for sharing i like lyn alden going to check it out
338195,anybody knows her contacts i have a beautiful theme to continue her pow vs pos
338197,may be through linkedin because twitter dms are closed
338198,i really recommend listening to her on what bitcoin did podcast macro recaps
338205,do you guys like that solidly reduces emissions as more tokens are locked curve doesnt do this afaik wouldnt lower emissions typically reduce attractiveness of some pools and lead to lower liquidity it seems like a wash at best
338206,if theres a purposevalue to holding them then it balances out theoretically
338207,do you have any book or other recommendations to understand the finance world better derivatives bonds etc
338208,
338209,anyone know how i can check where was the avax bridged from for this address
338210,just fuddin to load up his bags
338211,he is a vlcvx whale
338212,he gets a bunch of airdrop
338213,he doesnt need to do that
338214,they says charlie is on the multisig can we verify this
338215,why they dont tag them
338216,
338217,yeah wasnt sure how to proceed from here ty vincent
338218,her view on pow vs pos is often overlooked i think everyone in crypto should listen to what she says about it
338219,im deaf can you gimme a rundown
338220,the youtube version is annotated its a debate on bankless of pow vs posshe explains why proof of work is commoditymoney and proof of stake is equitymoney and all of the things we are beloved things we are sacrificing when the eth 2 merge is complete
338221,
338222,oh wow wasnt this everywhere
338223,
338224,some interesting context
338228,i am curious how stripe led the 100m funding round the one company you would expect to be able to sniff out payment vaporware
338231,maybe they deliberately overfunded the shittiest competitor to kneecap everyone else and slurp it all up later
338232,100m cheaper than losing the entire mkt
338233,10mln per month goddamn it on what
338234,bit too late for that
338235,by january when they funded fast bolt already had a 10b valuation
338236,hmm actually maybe hmm well if you really want be tinfoilly you could say stripe did it to discredit the whole oneclick checkout hype or essentially kneecap bolt from threatening their dominance as a processor but honestly that sounds almost like a bad highachool drama or something
338237,this may have the exact opposite effect where bolt is the one which benefits from this
338238,it would be interesting to see how the numbers stack up for bolt
338239,
338240,discuss
338242,the stablecoin fiatcoin trust act
338244,tldr1 you need to regsiter2 the stable should be 100 or more backed with assets expect audits3 you cant do loans stuff4 the term security does not include a payment stablecoin
338245,usdt is fucked
338246,usdc still gucci
338247,i recommend referring these questions to google
338248,likely its just fed coin at this point lol
338249,it just says backed by assets not necessarily 11 with usd
338250,needs to be redeemable but can be on a lag
338251,with a market value equal to not less than100 percent of the par value of the paymentstablecoins outstanding
338252,yeah and what assets exactly tether is backed again
338253,coupons bank notes
338254,audit will tell
338255,those are hardly assets
338256,idk youd have to check their report
338257,anyone knows how to calculate slippage percentagei have 2 valuesexpected outcome without slippage when buying 10085631211330535actual outcome with slippage when buying 10085431620129384would that just be 10085631211330535 10085431620129384 100
338259,or multiply with 100 and substract 1
338262,can someone confirm
338264,
338265,ah i see thankx
338274,off to the legal fugezi blabla
338275,cool stuff
338276,no shill only research dont delete please
338278,what are some defi lending platforms that take yusdc or other interest bearing tokens as collateral
338279,
338280,what is this can you explain briefly
338281,you can join andor create custom money markets
338282,i believe you were asking about this the other day nourharidy
338283,thank you
338284,uniswap v3 lm now live on poly happy farming
338286,wen eth
338287,wdym eth pools
338288,good analysis but this analysis underestimated the gap between votium and vecrv bribes in practice if you measure how much protocols actually shell out versus how many vecrv votes they gets the difference is even more dramatic
338289,wen frax on arrakis sir were on polygon uni v3 all i see is fiatcoins not even mai
338290,its there mai is there and check dm ser i have sent proposal
338291,i love proposals will check ty
338292,are 12m in lm awards still available gamma just opened polygon v3 pools
338293,hey our pools at timeswap supports any erc20 tokens as collat including yield bearing assets we launched couple of weeks ago on polygon mainnet right now we only have a usdcmatic pool but we are planning to launch pools with yield bearing assets as collateral soon come check us out apptimeswapio
338294,maifinance yearn but on fantom abracadabramoney
338295,what makes this difficult i thought lp lose 50 of the time to il does the incentives make up for that now
338296,fees and il are both amplified on concentrated liquidity to be successful requires sophisticated strategies for different market conditions and objectives many protocols have added lm on top of conc liq pools to get people to use them
338297,gas fees on l1 have made concentrated liquidity somewhat challenging as the high fees can tear into rebalancing and limit the flexibility of certain strategies
338298,has any protocol cracked it yet universe gelato popsicle and probably many others all trying to do v3 auto any actually work and not lose over time
338299,understandable
338300,im biased i cant really answer that
338301,lm programs have generally been unsuccessful in retaining long term tvl for these protocols as the rewards fall off
338302,
338303,
338304,
338305,regarding what
338308,no idea ser i just hope its not stargate am outside and i have decent stable bags there
338309,im a data scientist and im learning blockchain dev i want to dive into defi but i dont have a lot of knowledge in finance do you have any suggestions for books on defi that are really instructive and not just hype
338310,ctrl f dev roadmap
338311,im ds too i just finished the bootcamp on encode now they are providing assistance to get a job in crypto space they are going to close the registration form for new batch on 15th april and it is free thanks encode team
338312,hey i was data scientist as well1 first of all try to understand protocols from2 after that you have to try to take a real defi task my suggestion is implementing your own yearnfinance strategybasic intro advanced intro and any other videos from saltyfacu on youtube3 solidity you can practice withhard hat tutorialslanguages u need to work with solidity jsts
338313,if you are asking about books those books are pretty good for defi onboarding
338314,darrenlautf when new editiondefi has changed a lot since publishing
338315,it is so hard now i think he needs to write 3 more books about defi
338316,beginneradvanceddegened

338321,stakedao
338322,what makes you think this
338323,dis
338325,
338326,is this it
338327,i dont know just looking at odd txs
338328,considering they got 3m theres still 12m left for other clm protocols
338329,wow gg
338330,no this is a sandwich
338331,ah ok i cant tell just looked odd
338332,true
338333,
338334,check your dms
338335,who exactly got sandwiched there seems to be a lot going of there over multiple blocks
338336,mmmmm sandmich
338338,double dip
338339,hey frens does anyone have direct contacts of trail of bits and coinspect
338340,hows this a double dip
338341,nan
338342,scroll to the bottom
338343,yes i saw that can i dm you
338350,he made 950 eth from 17 eth
338368,cleaned up here a bit deleted weird gpt3 alike bot messages continue pls3
338369,solidly model is fair launch then emission decreases 2 per week with initial 20m the first week
338370,where can i find this form
338371,2 down from some constant rate i guess ignoring the reduction of emissions with increase of venft supply
338372,its 2 from constant but then the breakdown between what goes to lockers and farmers depend on locking rate
338374,the only downside of solidly is that as long as solid emission is diminished it provides less and less incentive for liquidity providers to provide liquidity in that protocol as providers do not accrue fees nor bribes only solid emission which will soon enter tail emission phase 70 already emitted thus a major liquidity migration from solidly to another amm is upcoming imho
338375,certik raised 88m and reaches 2 billion valuation with new funding from goldman sachs and others link
338376,does ctk token relate to certik audit firm
338377,yes
338378,what is its usecase
338379,we need to pay in ctk token for auditing
338380,no token not needed
338381,fan token
338382,you can show that you are a fan of their services lol
338386,no price talks please read the rules pinned
338387,ser u boomer okok thank u for keeping us clean
338388,pay usd to audit sir
338389,nan
338390,inverse for shorter list
338391,nan
338392,is there any data on how much audits were done by each auditor so that we could take that into account what of protocols was hacked after each audit i mean if certik accounts for 7 hacked projects audits but made audits for 90 of the defi projects this makes up for completely different situation if they only audited 7 projects and 7 of them were hacked
338393,power of marketing huh
338394,stories and followings are some of the most effective tools in web3
338395,were contracts in the same state at the time of audit or is this an intentional fud chart
338396,
338397,taken from here
338398,contract state is a valid consideration nonetheless however so long as projects are allowed to slap the certik logo on their ui and lul users into a false sense of security im not sure of the value of it
338399,
338402,true it would be very useful if metamask whatever wallet could verify a contract has been audited prior to transacting
338403,pretty useless chart without putting it in relation to the total amounts of audits done and information on whether the attack vector was within the audited scope then you also would have to normalize the data for a bunch of other factors such as the tvlpopularity of the audited projects of each auditor and so oni get that auditor x bad because of hack y is a common meme but has anyone actually approached this with scientific methodology
338404,not to mention the auditor could have made recommendations that the team did not follow
338405,precisely assuming my project is audited by certik and i post the contract owner private key on twitter does that go into the chart of certik audited hacks
338406,this topic and security concerns in general is way more nuanced than 99 of people talking about it recognize
338407,elaborate
338408,read the above
338409,what happened to sdt
338410,audits are marketing tools ive done my due dilligence so you can feel confident in investing in my protocol doesnt matter if anyone does scientific research on it my funds still got stolen i had faith in an auditor looking at this project i interacted with and i still got fucked the auditors reputation should be on the line if a project they approve gets rekt if protocol doesnt follow the recommendations write so in the audit report i actually read the findings the audit company should not allow for the protocol to say their audited when its several versions behind etc
338411,i think youre making something something more complicated than it needs to be
338412,audits are marketing tools they are abused for marketing purposes but marketing certainly is not the main concern of an auditthe auditors reputation should be on the line if a project they approve gets rektwhat do you mean by that if protocol doesnt follow the recommendations write so in the audit reportdead end even if a project complies with all recommendations there is no way for the auditor to verify that they will keep doing so in the future and that means they can effectively not revoke the audited by
338413,i think you are one of those people who are trying to simplify it to a level that does not honor the reality of it this whole if an audited projects gets hacked the auditor is to blamementality just doesnt account for a bunch of scenarios
338414,i expect most problems arise after the audit but dont have data to back up this hypothesis
338415,search in the bootcamp session
338418,if the audit says dev has a single key that can rug the whole thing then noif the audit says luks gud k tnx bye then yes
338419,the problem with many of these audit firms is that they prioritize code bugs over economic exploits and they certainly dont audit team opsec so audited projects keep getting hacked
338420,also you get what you pay for
338421,not all audits are created equal
338422,marketing may not be the main concern but it certainly is part of it as for reputation being on the line that should be self explanatory its no different from how you have people in this very chat saying you shouldnt touch cream with a 10 ft pole because its been exploited several times over or waves is a ponzi because insert story theres very little ambiguous hereeven ifthe contracts are public if they cared they can verify it at the time of the exploit
338423,lets say we want to design some kind of levelling method with tokens via solidity and we have came up with two solutionsfirst method accepts as parameter a desireable amount of levelups eg for 10 lvl 14 lvl it will be 4 then calculates the summary cost of levelling up and executes transferfrom from users addresssecond method accepts as parameter a desirable max amount of cost to level up eg 100 sometoken then calculates maximum amount of levelups available for that cost and executes transferfrom with sufficient for max possible lvlupquestionswhat method from user and uidev perspective will be favorable to work with are there any guidelines which favour one of those methods in front of another
338424,hello lobs im trying to compile a list of defi primitivies money legos swapslendingbondingvestingtimelocks the protocols that first introduced them and any forks of those protocols like an civilization style techtree for ethereum it seems like something that someone may have done before but im not sure where to look any recommendations
338425,
338426,this is pretty damn cool
338427,re uni v3 liquidity mining
338428,this sounds retarded as fuck
338429,nan
338430,lol
338431,i think this is a basic implementation of the idea
338432,guessing to make this really viable it will take some effort and tinkering
338433,hack the funds to a contract that guarantees you 10 of the hacked funds
338434,to simplify the audit process our team is building an automated tool with the intention of vetting out 5060 issues during the development stage of a project lifecycle happy to have a conversation if anyone is looking to try this out
338435,the arbitrager thing seems a bit wonky but id bet many hackers will opt into to this if they are guaranteed 10
338436,what happens when 10 is the marketcap of the project
338437,this means the hack already happened fund and user fund r rekt the address is then set up to a third party which also now might want a fee otherwise the address is the same hacker then why even do it
338438,are they just larping on marketing if so good one but jfc
338439,idk maybe milkyklim vshvsh consider this product fine idk
338440,apeir99n thots
338441,whats the difference with an escrow contract
338442,this
338443,wonder if there is a way to automatically put the owner as the project multisig
338444,probably not
338445,its stupid
338446,if 10 to hacker is normalized im switching to gamedev
338447,onchain or offchain d
338448,tabletop
338449,this will be a nightmare for pr for crypto media will report on the hack without including the recovery details regulators will pull these up as examples of how crypto is a scam
338450,i think we can generalize the discussion to white vs black hat people choose the black hat just because those 10 are higher than the white hat bug bounty which in most cases is nonexistant compared to the 10
338451,the first step is where the hacker would just nope and bounce
338452,btw whats the best way to launder 600 mil asking for a fren
338453,start an olympus fork
338455,no joke that works
338456,how would you know
338457,what if you had 50 different addresses lping into a uni v3 position and your hacker wallet swapped the stolen stuff senslessly to and fro eth and some random shitcoin and collect fees as whitewashed money
338458,if the idea is theyre supposed to turn white because 10 why not make it 25
338459,compare bounties claimed on immunefi for example and their theoretical payouts
338460,the idea is you are at a better position to negotiate with someone you have their balls in your hand
338461,what you have is at best an irrelevant correlation
338462,if you hacked already u already have balls
338463,the goal is to make this shit be able to get 10 wo hacking the protocol and fud
338464,so their product makes 0 sense
338465,can this automatically send it to tornado and then to a wallet that the hacker designates programmable escrow with tornado built in
338466,10 clean money 25 dirty
338467,again how would you know
338468,how do you suppose this could be implemented
338469,i say im okay with 1 is that relevant to an actual blackhat vs this borderline flipflopper youre imagining
338470,empirical data ser why so many hackers decided to go that route instead of otherwise
338471,go ahead and provide the data
338472,it cant be
338473,we are playing with the idea getting others to contribute and make it better maybe at some stage the community will convarge around it
338474,it kinda is it doesnt add anything over the project just offering 10 per normal disclosure
338475,normalize 10 theft
338476,but a projects rarely offer 10and b when they offer whatever once the hacker disclosed the vulnerability and this has happened many many times the project essentially tells them to fuck off reducing the severity delaying payments etc
338477,this stuff only has a chance of beginning to make sense if tvl has any meaningful relationship with the marketcap of projects you have more than a handful of projects in defillamacom where their marketcap is 10 their tvl including the top 2 some are even so bad that its 1
338478,of course they dont offer that its ridiculous
338479,agreed we have faced a similar kind of situation a couple of times
338480,but once they are hacked wormhole thorchain etc they immdiately offer a 10 bounty
338481,curve gets hacked for all theyre worth tomorrow 10 is 2b thats what you want to pay flipflopping blackhats because
338482,you dont and hacker tornados away what did you gain
338483,a quick death vs a slow one where youre making a fraud feel good about themselves
338484,hacker has to spend the next however long figuring out how to make 2b in tornadoed funds into something they can actually spend
338485,while looking over their shoulder for the rest of their lives
338486,hmm how do you even calculate 10 tvl is not liquid money and certainly not capital under the teams control
338487,we already got a tweet suggesting to add a log function on the amount we dont know if it is going to be usable
338488,at least i gave the 90 back makes them sleep better at night
338489,its an incentive problem and adding a smart contract to it doesnt change anything at allthe hacker is in control of the funds and can choose whether to accept the projects offer
338490,18b slow death either way you are trying to do your best at damage control at that point negotiating with an imperfect human is part of the job
338491,imperfect is one thing pretentious fraud is another
338492,if the being so high is what is going to change your mind then why not take 25 the project still gets 75 back
338493,75 is a large number is it not
338495,
338496,how about instead of giving someone literally billions or even millions you instead make a police report and start investigating the massive billions of dollars of stolen cash
338497,like lmao at the idea that youre going to launder 20b through tornado
338498,maybe theyll open a 10k eth contract just for you
338499,these arent just arbitrary numbers at some point you dont have to give the thief free money to give you back the money they stole instead you track the thief down and stop them the old fashioned way
338500,because everyone will be interested in that guy that literally stole twenty billion dollars
338501,its not like you can spend it
338502,this 10 bullshit maybe makes sense for a theft of 1m
338503,but above that no you do not negotiate with an imperfect human by giving them free money and absolution
338504,you make them work for it oh you stole 20b im really interested to see how youre going to turn that into something usable willywonkajpg
338505,even if you dont think the authorities will be competent there is now a 20b bounty for the real life blackhats
338506,theres 20b in an account that this guy has control over you dont think some 5 wrenches are coming their way
338507,multisigs arent just good because they prevent compromise of single keys from turning into power over a high value account theyre also good because they deter opportunists from seeing you as the only target they have to knock down to get the candy inside
338508,yes but something with 20b in it is going to attract nationstate tier attackers at some point kinds of people who can actually pulloff simultaneous assaults on those in the multisig
338509,a nation state wont care to give you back 90 either
338510,theyll just take all 20b d
338511,yeah at some point protocol ownership should 100 be abandoned there are protocols in existence with nearly 30b tvl that are governed by 35 multisigs
338512,if i were an impoverished 3rd world country with not a lot of money but plenty of guns and people who didnt value their lives id look at that and see a softtarget
338513,total noob question what editor is good for solidity js these days
338514,vs code for the most noob friendly answer
338519,
338520,
338521,psastarsagora exploit on metis
338523,looks like everything is alright suggest checking access from another pc or in incognitoif someone might have been able to generate a malicious valid cert like kakao had recently for tornado cash you will see it here
338524,maybe one of my browser extensions is compromised testing them all out one by one
338526,can you reproduce it while in incognito normally extensions are disabled in incognito
338527,unless you enabled them specifically
338528,it looks like i dont get it on incognito i have only enabled metamask on incognito
338529,okay after testing a bit more i even got it with incognito
338530,could you please record it on video or screenshot it and send me to dm for everyone will give an update to chat as well
338531,im in contact with tornado cash team rn just to double checkps no attack observed yet looks like someone reported this relay to avast and thus avast is highlighting it as phishing as relayers decentralised maybe one of operators is abusing others to make users use his relay emailed avast to get more info
338532,okay will do
338534,yes ligma and deez
338539,exit liquidity is a bit of a hyperbole but otherwise contains interesting metrics
338542,well if your product which is an algo stable has a working mechanism that keeps the peg why would you pay to incentivise a sink
338546,for any lobs going to paris here is an events list
338547,is the buidlers party meant to cost a milli
338551,hes basically saying they setup 4pool because they need very deep liquidity to swap ust to usdc and usdt to buy btc with it on ethereum in the kind of size they cant do on terra and it is cheaper to incentivise 4pool for enough liquidity than to sell luna otc at large discounts because they cannot dump luna on the market directly and tank the price r
338553,nan
338554,anyone else noticed that do was larping about not choosing eth for the reserve because of how the smart contract platform competition means that it could be replaced unlike btc then goes on to add avax to the reserve anyway marketing reserve stability imo
338555,i was actually surprised he would add avax because of that reason
338556,we may very well see him add others moving forward too
338557,high fees high fungibility high sustainability low fragility good price supporteth wins and the rest will just be the same way as eos etc went
338558,i love using services that charge me large sums of money
338560,anyone who knows details about 1inch routing dm me pls
338562,is there a curve btc3pool anywhere
338563,you just need to move more value so the fees seem less
338565,theres a code its meant to be a lock afaik
338566,if you know the code pls dm
338568,on avalanche iirc theres a tricrypto pool with wbtc weth and avalanches 3pool
338569,there were a lot of chats during the first weeks after its token launch try to look back into chat history
338570,with the potion unlock what is the tldr game theory behind unlocking early vs late
338571,if you have a significant part of the codebase you can holdout and demand certain things else you wont release ur part of the secret if you unlocked early i think you got a bonus of some sorts
338572,oh not all potions are needed for the unlock and then those who do use them get tokens but those who have more than the minimum needed to finish the launch would be able to hold the entire system for ransom interesting
338574,only for a max of 90 days after that the team can decide to unlock the code anyway the game is to unlock as a community build a community project
338575,holding out for 90 days is quite painful for any launch
338576,also the most rare nfts have a redundancy of 2 meaning the code they hold for the unlock is also in 1 other nft only one of those needs to unlock for that part of code to be available so if you hold more than 1 in that category you can take you chances and play hard ball and hope you have some duplicates but the idea is that the community unlocks as a creative way instead of holding the protocol hostage for 90 days
338578,alright makes sense thanks
338581,chanced upon this thought it was a very good article
338582,
338583,
338584,The story begins
338585,dorks
338590,ser does this mean trading soon ser
338591,lol
338592,something else first
338593,i see v2
338594,is this about the kovanplayground channel on discord
338595,with the tax season sending people insane would really appreciate any input here in an attempt to make the overall experience way better for people thanks
338596,ser blz ctrlf on tax those convos were done a few times
338597,ah yeah just redirecting to my earlier questionairre link hoping to get a few more participants haha wont spam though thanks ivangbi
338598,hello lobsters can anyone share the different pitch desks maybe someone still has examples
338599,
338600,made this one a while ago i hope it helps
338601,ty ser
338602,there are also several in thread
338604,is there anyone here who can put me in touch with someone from qcp or help with the referring process would like to ask a few questions
338605,be cautious with qcp maybe unlucky but i has a very bad customer experience
338606,looking for simple way to get historic onchain data i would like to get holders addresses of particular coin on particular date i assume its not so easy to solve this hopeing someone has done something similar and there is some ground workservice with api
338607,dune analytics is the simplest way i believe
338608,something like this dashboard
338609,you can fork the query add and blocktime as a filter
338610,thnx sir will try it
338611,anyone have a link to an instance of uniswap where swap and send is enabled
338612,or some other idea for how to do it
338613,i know its possible to do with 1inch limit orders using the standard ui
338614,yeah its not the same though
338615,for example if youre doing it with a fee on transfer token they go to 1inch first and then to the destination wallet so you get hit with fees twice
338616,if you do it on uni directly it avoids that
338617,through researching about layerzero i found that its super easy to find an information about how project x will underminerevolutionize sth and super hard about risks and doubts about project x about layerzero i found just a few paragraphs mb its all because my information bubble though understanding risks in crypto is not less valuable as understanding opportunities may be u know if there are some tg channelstwitterother sources which are aggregating info about risksuncertainties about new hyping projects eg layerzerodefioptionsvetokenomicsu name it
338618,we kinda try to do it here too _
338623,youre buying nfts called maniak aliens philanthropy club and the network is making sure that this is really what you want

338633,really accurate im surprised what is normally a normie channel is relatively high level and niche
338634,solid
338635,and that breakdown joma gives in the comments for those who need context is very admirable
338636,the matthew mcconaughey replacement weirdly looks like a young sifu
338637,ah he is sifu
338638,the level of accuracy in the video dayum
338639,
338640,ah so is confirmed i bet everyone has seen takes already but oh well thanks for pumping my cvx yieldbags i guess a bit lame tho
338641,as soon as some action results in increased market cap for a competitor crypto biz dev teams warm up their copy machines let me guess are they offering anchor yield 1 on said stables
338643,05 for now ser
338644,though as anchor protocol apy decreases this will increase
338647,
338648,u cant be serious ser
338649,was chatting about this in another group
338650,its split between this is a complete ponzi that will crumble to this is a pretty cool innovation to utilize uni v3 like that

338656,good takes
338657,on the upcoming l1 stablecoin war usn near vs ust terraassuming that usn uses a collateralbased mechanism it sounds like it could really dominate over ustimagine there are 2 banks issuing bank notes stablecoin bank a takes a basket of assets as deposit collaterals and issues iou banknotes thats a proportion of the deposit the riskier the asset the lower the proportion in the case of a bank run or high market volatility they can liquidate the assets to unwind the iou and ensures that the bank notes are always redeemable for an equivalent in value of assets bank b is a promising upstart that had issued its own stock native token it issues an equivalent in value of iou bank notes when you hand in their stock to them their guarantee is that when someone wants to cash out the bank notes they can always create new bank stocks in equivalent value and pay that back to you so the banks equity supply is elastic essentially a stock buy back in the good times and stock splits to pay ious in the bad times the idea of this bank sounds revolutionary doesnt it it seems that it can never be unable to pay back its debts or go into insolvency and its a shame we dont see something like this in tradfi yetnow if u were given a choice as a user between holding bank notes from bank a or from bank b and both are giving 20 yields which would you pick which is more sound to you now throw in a sweetener that is that bank bs yields are scheduled to come down soon what do you think would happenin case anyone gets confused bank a would be near again im speculating on its mechanism bank b would be terra
338658,there isnt a l1 stablecoin war ust cannot sustain without outside funds
338661,risks of downward spiral for luna waiting to watch what happens when they lower yields
338662,l1 stablecoin wars probably wont happen since fraxust are the 2 biggest players already ust is buying select l1 tokens like btc avax frax is buying l1 tokens proportional to how much frax is used on each chain and were natively issuedmintable on 12 different chains not sure why its a good idea to start a stablecoin from scratch instead of just have ustfrax issue natively on your mainnet and buy up the l1 token and fraxust are friends so both can expand to the same chain and double the demand for the l1 token
338663,lol
338664,
338665,agreed but if the bribes were properly working the mode would work its not a concept design issue its an execution issue
338666,any plans to work with centrifuge in regards to realworld assets
338667,by that same notion the l1 war is probably over too and ethereum will be king forever frax also seems much smaller than dai atm im not trying to attack frax in fact i think frax has a very interesting mechanism and i would definitely choose it over ust any day it seems really unfortunate to me that you would want to tie the fate of frax with ust and ride on their coattails
338668,usn will have 20 yield
338669,making native stable coin is the best way to keep ecosystem value distributing profits to their investors affecting others
338670,but pegged first
338671,
338672,user acquisition
338674,40x leverage is just exactly what small frogs need sbut at least they will introduce variable interest rate actually interested in how this all will play out
338675,wonder if the team will also drive a liquidation cascade themselves here or if the market does this by its own
338676,you are wrong ser
338677,
338678,these are just facsimile given non fungible form
338679,false prophets
338680,i mean profits
338681,
338682,not bad stats
338684,i can connect you with optimism peeps
338685,their bizdevgrowth guy good or would you like another kind of person
338686,thank you just dmed you sir
338687,if youre there in person can do personal intro as well
338688,hi everyone i received my dappnode yesterday and playing with it i got this gnosis offer with 4 gno to stake its cool now i am wondering if i should also run a tornado relayer i would love to privacy decentralization future cool stuff in cli bla bla but i am wondering if i should because i would need at least 300torn and thats quite a lot for my portfolio to adquire anyone has experience running a relayer
338689,i think its better to run more gno validators almost 17pc apr
338690,and what happens onceif btc alts are making another 50 dip
338691,leverage is what destroys all of the smaller players
338692,ust is not backed by the btc alts value tho they are there as a safety measure to stop the death spiral of luna when a sell off happens but ust itself is not technically backed by those assets
338693,other stables will have other mechanisms why use frax and ust if theres already dai integrated everywhereusers get the option of choice better alternatives if any rise will capture market share
338694,technically yes you are correctbut the market psychologysome other player aka alameda might try to play the game
338695,this is a very interesting project im producing a podcast about narrativestoryfocused nft initiatives and the live performancestorytelling aspect of the project not to mention the artist enablement mechanisms here are interesting can you dm me to discuss theres potential we might be interested in having the team on the show thanks
338696,does anyone know how leveraged yield is meant to work struggling to figure out how you can profit after funding
338697,like who is selling me margin and why arent they just in the same farm as me
338698,you dont have funding rates but only borrow rates sorry for the silly note why they are not in the same rates imbalance is a great question1 markets are never ever anywhere efficient even boomer good is not as such information asymmetry2 even if information is perfect risk is perceived differently so some passive lps would rather make lower apy but not be susceptible to liquidations if any just different risk tolerance 3 making yields converge crosschain is still in early af stage4 etc
338699,in case of abracadabra it works like this1 abracadabra lets one mint abras stablecoin mim for yielding position2 then one swap mim for yielding positionthe process repeats and abra has a nice ui for doing this process automaticallymargin comes from growing liqudation risk
338700,there are multiple reasons for having rates be different really oh and number 5 it might have been a protocol to protocol loan in which case it was given at a lower rate like if aave were to give cds to gearbox or dai3 module protocols are genuinely happy with 3 even when they brrrr while retail is happy to pay more than 3 at any time
338701,abracadabra is not a great example tho of such things cause its more of a broken system cause daniele is a crook
338702,can u expand on that
338703,danielle is a crook thats all there is to explain after months of false promises and false hopes and mismanagement and shady stuff over multiple projects idk what else you wanna hear tbh
338705,ty everyone crab market tg best tg
338706,i got some reading to do
338707,the real takeaway of that thread is that dani does not know about disperse
338708,yeah that is obvious but about the broken system its just because of danielle or there is more
338709,dmd
338712,sorry but removing praise of forks on other chains not sure its of any relevance
338713,hmm maybe i am not understanding it properly but btc treasury is supposed to be the mechanism that prevents other players from taking advantage of a depeg right in that aspect shouldnt the treasury lessen the chance of the psychological impact even in a relative market downturn
338714,im starting to think ust like a kind of perpetual convertible bond or commercial paper rather than some pure ponzi but i still dont think it could qualify the definition of stablecoin because its still a open system and requires external cashflow to peg
338715,thats debatable vedao owns a significant portion of solid emission and initially was created to gain voting control over solidlyright now they are looking for evolution of their project as solidly has its flawsbut yeah in the end that would be a solidly fork with yettobeanounced major changes
338717,and it would be a fork on a ghost chain
338718,lets leave that discussion thank u nothing to discuss there really
338719,you mean vedao not solidly in general right
338720,yup and tbh not sure whats new on solidly there is either
338721,deus teaming up with 0xdao and bribing is an interesting one to watch imo
338722,but ust minted is not luna debt that you need to pay back not saying its pure ponzi just not sure the comparison with bonds or commercial papers applies
338723,i would have thought discussion of shortcomingfixes of solidly tokenomics are of great relevance not much details out now maybe better to bring them back when the specifics are available for all to look at
338724,yup my feeling is some ideas may be similar between the perp bonds and ust but we may not directly compare them companies issue bonds and promise yields to acquire funds this is sort of like people buy so cash inflow luna mint ust for yields on anchor yield paid by lfg you burn ust for luna this is sort of like redeem equities with convertible bonds so just like what will happen in the real world when a company is not going well the price of bond will crash ust will depegcrash if luna is not going well
338725,buying btc avax may sounds like building a reserve but im question if they really have any mechanism to ensure liquidationredeem in case of severe depeg
338726,shouldnt the treasury lessen the chance of the psychological impactthats going to work as well as gmo veggie yam before it its one thing if the market understands theres no backing its another if the market thinks of your algo stable as some roundabout collateralized stablecoin
338728,using highly volatile asset for the purpose of stabilising what could have gone wrong
338729,
338730,rug valhalla of ichi
338732,how do you borrow more tokens than deposited
338733,i dont know ser
338734,interest rate
338735,as in bad debt
338736,you dont the risk here is in the collateral ichi xichi losing value and liquidating everyone
338737,oh yeah i see yeah i guess you can compare the models like that but even then its not at the same level the current cash inflow in the luna comes at a monthly cost of about 120 million offered as subsidized apy on anchor i guess its just hard for me to reconcile that with the cash inflow model
338738,has anyone found a clean way to catch a custom error in a try catch statement i dont care about the params passed in the custom error i just care if it was thrown in solidity
338739,yes indeed the current number of issued ust and the current apr on anchor cant justify the stability of this stablecoin
338740,guys how much does the block research membership costs
338741,cant find anywhere on website
338742,
338743,finally
338744,anyone knows how token reputation is scored
338746,id guess pagerank
338747,heuristics include extremely high supply not being able to transfer until an unlock or date domain names in the name etc
338748,also if it matches the unicode confusable property of a whitelist of contract names
338749,
338750,this package is used by metamask as an example for helping protect against possibly fakemalicious ens names
338751,this is interesting concept
338752,id imagine this has uses beyond monkey jpegs
338753,i imagine you read it and seen it has
338754,i have i am asking for a discussion beyond what is in the article i am not your enemy
338755,sorry ser felt it differently my bad anyhow i guess u can say this is kinda multisig but for specific assets i think u can make some kind of guardian staking contract where u stake all your erc assets as a security measure but i think we would need more testing and thinking i bet a lot of people that got hacked would live to have a way to save assets even though they got hacked so i think this staking can be implemented for any token
338756,its basically a multisig
338757,yep kinda
338758,you couldnt do something like eth pos cause of slashing
338759,once assets are locked by the guardian they cannot be transferred but the user still holds ownership of those assetsif they cannot directly be transferred by the user he does not have ownership
338760,lobster daily 376 daily recap 8 april1 seafood at techcrunch the future of programmable moneywatch the video link link to discussion 2 avax instead of eth for reserveslink to discussion 3 gearbox protocol updatelinklink to discussion 4 if wolf of wall street were about defi 20link link to discussion
338761,the more im reading the more i feel this idea is ok for nfts but would be pain for any other too many trxs u do for erc20 where with most of nfts u have them idle in the wallet
338762,i think it does not work with default nfts the base requirement is that the nft complies with this it basically allows for staking as in giving some sort of benefit to a user as long as an asset in their control without them actually having to move it to another contract
338763,frens have you ever tried to use offline smartphone as a coldwallet ive checked parity but it seems abandoned coinid vaul also here but its for btc onlywhat app you would suggestthe goal is to keep it as a vault and sometimes sign outgoing txs in ethbtc
338764,
338765,twittercommetamaskstatus1494742718425223169
338768,also tails os or whonix live usb is a great solution for creating airgapped cold storage classic still works ok keep in mind airgapcomputercom
338770,better off learning how to use qubes and virtualization
338771,
338772,its the best you can get if you wanna do more sophisticated stuff yourself
338773,but i would advise just use a hardware wallet
338774,hmm why not set up a tornadocash like zk based for nfts you still have the same inplace virtual staking but now instead of a guardian you can transfer your nft to any other address if you have the backup key
338775,yeah thought it was a revest clone at first but no its something a bit different we have a similar function for our fnfts though not standardized in this manner the concept is a decent one however the existence of smart wallets kinda obviates it as a true staking mechanism i can just use eip1167 to deploy a smart wallet lock my assets into that smart wallet and transfer ownership of the smart wallet itself as an nft
338776,granted if you want a security mechanism to avoid your bayc getting stolen this is a pretty good option
338777,reminds me of a credit freeze irl
338778,i guess you dont really a snark because theres no hiding which addresses owned the nfts before but its still better than having a guardian address that has custody over your nfts
338779,not really just keep it on an address secured by a hardware wallet and dont stake it in dubious ponzis
338780,im still in xenforo forums times and all dat stuff thank you for an awesome tip
338781,yes thats what id recommend however i can see the angle this guy is coming from
338782,yeah the idea makes sense basically its non custodial staking it tries to address the problem that you can not verify onchain as in do the verification onchain whether someone moves an assets and therefore can not reliably distribute rewards based on that its basically a hook that notifies the staking contract when the asset is moved
338783,i think the point is that the guardian contract is just the 721 you disable transfers at the contractlevelmind you thats only useful if the person compromising the wallet doesnt realize it is valuable i have seen this exact scenario play out with revest someone lost their private keys the hacker took everything but the fnfts containing more value than the rest of the assets put together because they didnt know what they were the impacted user was able to wait a month then return to the wallet and transfer out their impacted assets because the hacker had moved on security by obscurity isnt secure and this method will still break once the hackers figure out what is going on
338784,fair but we will still have a ton of people clicking random things even in like 15 years
338785,my opinion is that you will never be able to fix that if you give people self custody they are going to do stupid things the only way to solve that is taking custody away from them but thats called web2
338786,i suppose my impression was that it prevented transfers of such anyways you can wrap it in eip1167 and the asset will appear to be static but because i can transfer the rights to access that smart wallet it doesnt matter this is the exact way that rvst and our work with lqdr gets around the base curve mechanics to have one lock per wallet we use contractbased smart wallets tied to nfts to allow staking via proxy with a custom smartwalletchecker to whitelist everything and taking liquidity on vecrv positions
338787,thank you farm42 lafayettetabor qubes is good but id like to have mobile device will try out mmk and airgap
338788,ill give it some time before saying it will not be solved if the pain is big enough someone will play with the idea of solving it
338789,its an unsolvable problem imho if a person has the possibility to do stupid thing they will do stupid thing if you take that possibility away you are taking part of their custody rights away
338790,not if u give them the option in the example above u first need to interact with that contract
338791,has anyone come across a good background check provider with actual expertise in cryptodefi
338792,maybe the best solution is hiring an osinter for daily due diligence can suggest looking at osintfrcom and other native osint communities sometimes it is better to train the right people yourself and look for people in similar fieldslike i did here
338793,what do you mean by background check
338794,for hiring contributors all the standard criminal bankruptcy judgment stuff an ability to check crypto sources references
338795,those are perfect narratives for lobsterdao like the reputation system with lobs nft curationjust some thoughts
338796,this is work that typically done by internal security department mostly expolice or exmilitary but all of them are using osint techniques and maybe buy leaked based at darknet forums this is all about osint adintgeointfacesearch and so on
338797,like you get someones cv then you should know where to check in which public government bases a certain data on which darkforums you can get needed data in which leakages from which private detectives how to detect a social engineer aiming to get hired etc
338798,i hope i wont be sacrificed for telling yall this this is a true due diligence
338799,if you are interested in it suggest checking cybdetective ibederov_en so much cool info on topic
338800,awesome thank you for the share
338801,whats the best way to get exposure to eth via the stock market ethe is there something that gives u yields from staking
338802,in canada brazil there are spot eth etfs burgerland not yet
338803,the eth is inactive and not staked
338804,buy spy when it tanks eth price will tank too
338805,so ethe for burgerland
338806,dont those get rekt by contangomaybe youll be better off writing to your representatives and voting for crypto friendly leaders
338807,im not citizen of the us lol how much is the rekt 2 apr
338808,you should consider this when dealing with grayscale
338809,quote from hereethe started trading in december 2017 and assets under management stand at 118 billionthe trust is up about 111 so far in 2021 by comparison ethereum has returned more than 408 in other words interested investors would likely be better off investing directly in ethereum
338810,wow that sucks thanks for the info
338811,why is polygon base fee always 0
338812,hey guys anyone knows any ammsliquidity pools that run on centralized exchanges other than binances liquid swap
338813,idex has kyc and is a hybrid order book and amm model
338814,bitcoin utxobased but a common approach for storing bitcoins in a secure manner is to put them into cold storage which means that their keys are stored on a device not connected to the internet however in order to retrieve the coins one must regularly albeit infrequently interact with those keys which makes them vulnerable as well we now introduce recoverable vaults which reduce the incentive for bitcoin private key theft vaults provide two mechanisms to increase security first funds stored in a vault can be recovered using a recovery key in case the vault key is compromised second in case the recovery key is compromised as well the owner can still prevent the attacker from moving the coins the worst the attacker can do is to prevent the owner from regaining full control over the funds as this reduces the motivation for key theft users can be more permissive in their storage of the private keys reducing the chances of key loss
338815,gateio has amm
338816,albeit its quite garbage
338817,are there any major vcs that have their own credible auditing team that they let portfolio companies use paradigm has a lot of researchers auditors seems like itd be a real differentiator
338818,binance has certik
338819,having internal auditors would mean vc could become liable in case of hacks
338820,oh missed the credible part
338821,hence most use external companies while keeping internal engineers as labs dept
338822,fair enough ill rephrase my question to are there any vcs that have internal security researchers that help with protocol security i totally agree they shouldnt publish reports for marketing purposes would be a big conflict
338823,pretty much any reputable vcarrington for example have tough dd standards on the tech side
338824,this is a hobby but until you mastered it i wouldnt trust reasonable sums of money on it
338826,biggest joke of this weekend thanks ser and no vcs how reputable they are do not have an in house auditing firm they simply wouldnt be able to manage that paradigm has sam and others maybe whitehatting daedalus has valentin sometimes glancing over dialectic dean when he is not shitfaced but thats not gonna match doing an audit nor it should
338827,stephangoss
338828,if vcs had enough sc engineers they would just spin up their own defi projects
338829,d2d loans and loans to daos sound interesting especially as additional liqudity for guilds it would nice to have opportunity to borrow money secured by the treasurylps if a daoguild has no reputation
338830,d2d loans sound interesting especially as additional liqudity for guilds it would nice to have opportunity to borrow money secured by the treasurylps if a dao has no reputation
338831,continue in here jellyf axdvdv
338832,by that logic trail of bits et al would stop doing audits and just build their own defi projects seems to me that a vc with a strong auditing team that gets lent out to projects ideally before the public audit so they pass with flying colors would be a valuable differentiator
338833,auditors are not liable in case of hacks
338834,there has been drainage out of top auditing firms across the board too
338835,you cant hire an sc dev into a cofounder position of a portfolio company let alone make an sc engineer tram to audit others its not practical really
338836,isnt letting somebody else do that part of the point of being a vc though
338837,yeah this convo is weird vcs are vcs and auditors are auditors why would you merge that at best they can get you an intro fast track you through their network
338838,i am not sure we are really arguing now topic is lost feels like fugezi convo the answer to the question is here if anybody knows more they r free to suggest and add but just warning an answer or having someone to look at the code is the same as going on a diet and then having 50 cheat days like then might not have it in the first place
338839,yup no convo to continue fugezi
338840,apologies sir meant an internal rd that defacto act as an internal auditing firm
338841,those are really different things and no anyway the garbage they invest in is often on par with polkastarter rugs
338842,imagine a top tier audit firm that took payments in seed allocations
338843,could probably yield higher than flat fee
338844,actually on second thought youre making a good point a smarter structure would be for a vc firm to do a bulk deal with someone like trail of bits and then allow their portfolio companies to pick up the auditing time its not even just a matter of it being expensive anymore its basically just impossible to even get time vc firm that guarantees access would have a big leg up getting on any cap table
338845,that causes a huge conflict if the audit is public instead of just for internal use
338853,no vc want to be tangled to any sort of attacks none of parties is liable
338854,but in case of an event people always point fingers then least you would want to have is your internal audit team at fault correct
338855,how about vcs poaching and hiring auditors from top tier auditing firms to establish an internal auditing division team as a matter of fact this is already happening within vc landscape its not as strange as you would think
338856,im not gonna name which vc but can tell you its happening
338857,it makes sense one of the biggest upfront expenses and toughest to squeeze in connections for a lot of new protocols
338858,we agree that in general vcs have a negative reputation in the space as competition increases both crypto native vcs raising shit load of capital and web2tradfi institutions entering the space more and higher strategic value add are required and demanded by crypto projectsprotocols providing gtm support bd tokenomics introductionsnetwork is becoming less strategic by the day vcs have to keep boosting their value add to remain relevant in the space therefore offering tech support product testing feedback governance support audits is not as crazy as you may think
338859,this
338860,yeah but no one wants a vc audit instead of hiring auditors at your vc firm it makes more sense to establish a partnership with an audit firm
338861,how are you so certain
338862,offering help with code is one thing but you probably dont want to publicly say that it was audited by a vc firm audits are supposed to be an independent examination there is a conflict of interest to some degree and retail is already sceptic of vcs i just dont think it would be perceived wellyou would have to create credibility as a vc firm to have the expertise etc just way simpler to make a partnership with an auditing firm could even invest in it
338863,nan
338864,anyone here know a good video editor that is available for a quick turn around
338865,hmm possibly i guess perspective matters with regards to the latter part why not both a vc could have an internal auditing team help portcos to jump queue for trail of bits openzeppelin
338867,kinda agree with this analogy
338868,but honestly you have rotten apples everywhere there are vcs which are truly toxic and detrimental for the vc reputation
338869,however how is this different from angels
338870,so the question becomes who do you want to raise money from retail sure they will dump the moment they receive that airdrop
338871,auditors that allow projects to jump queues for vcs allocations extra money or other shady reasons are not auditors theyre criminals posing as auditors
338872,ethically agree
338873,going back to the initial question just responding to illustrate the other side of the story
338874,30k oh my
338875,retail is even more skeptical about audits itself
338876,
338877,the problem is death note is still getting paid 2995k more than they should be worth what is negative reputation worth in crypto
338878,looking for ux feedback anything is appreciated
338879,hey just taking a look at it 1 no dark mode 2 max button at swap for ape mode 12 max also good for lp etc 3 maybe more colors theres not many colors on there yet 4 looks like it will work on mobile etc as expected great jobhappy to give more feedback once you have the next version
338880,great thank you mind if i dm you
338881,i found the floating header burger button for the sidebar a little bit unintuitive like how the header floats up until a certain point and the order of headersidebar depended on how far down the page i scrolled
338882,other than that i like it
338883,oh and _maybe_ give the arrow that swaps the order of your two assets an arrowhead on each side or its not super obvious what it does
338884,thanks appreciate it
338887,why
338888,remove the chart
338889,uniswaps great invention was removing charts from trading
338890,no one missed them
338891,also a range of prefill below the amount to help users enter in an amount by clicking as opposed to typing
338892,i join what others have said before especially gideon and i would add that the swapping box is probably too large on largewide screens its 2 times larger than on other dex i just checked again and then you have the priceslippagefee indications that are very far from the actual numbers etc but globaly its a good start good luck enhancing it
338893,does anyone have a contact at rarible its security related
338894,thank you appreciate it
338895,i would much rather have charting with my trading interface than need two interfaces just to trade i personally dont see a benefit to removing charting but if you have a good argument for it then it could go away
338896,hey i wrote a short overview about ethereum onchain analysis would love to hear your comments
338897,
338898,except all the dextools users
338899,
338900,wtf
338901,is this security in the actual house or solana blockchain lol
338902,why not both
338903,10 eth floor coming
338904,dried up maybe he will load some eth again
338906,
338908,whats the alpha we are missing here
338910,i do
338912,is there any good way of gathering ohlcv data for any and all live pairs on uniswap v2v3 besides my own node i am fine with paying need it for some market research
338913,oh i guess uniswap has official subgraphs that should do
338914,try
338915,nice research about play2earn
338916,
338917,burn the nfts asapthis is why we are implementing a reward model where the only way to get a higher grade of nfts is via burning a few lower grade nfts in a crafting process
338918,
338919,still sweeping rumor is andre is coming back to start lobster dex
338920,nan
338921,damn that was 3 sweeps
338922,holy moly
338923,okok continue in lobsterdao not here
338924,use davinci resolve not that hard to start free to use
338925,open source alternative for tgscanrobot
338926,hey ive posted a short thread about role of solace token in defi insurance would appreciate any feedbackquestions that i can use to write an article later
338927,
338928,looks interesting how does this differ from tools like slither mythx
338929,how does it work
338930,samueldare were building a saas based product which will come in handy for entreprise teams working together in collaboration slither and mythx is difficult to run on your codebase unless you have all the different imports in place your scan will not give proper results they also find out alot of false positives our dynamic reporting structure provides additional functionalities like mark your issue as false positivewont fix and if youve fixed the issue in the next iteration your report will have the bug status as fixed we have manual audit services as well performed by well know security researchers but our focus is to use our research in the manual audit and build more signatures for auto detection
338931,you could signup on and on your homepage youll have the option to scan a public github repository or contracts deployed on ethereum binance and polygonleveraging apis of etherscan bscscan and polygonscan
338932,well release the user guide by the end of this week to make it easier for users to go through the various features of our product sambacha
338933,tbh false positives are really annoying slither always throws them with open zepplin libraries i have found mythx to be less false positive prone slither does however let you mark a threshold for issues the site does have a nice ux but i fail to see how this really fixes anything with audits wish you the best
338934,samueldare manual services are always going to be more effective than any kind of automated solutions our initiative is to root out 5060 vulnerabilities in the earlier stage during development to make the manual audit process more faster and effective for enterprises by leveraging our reports plus for new projects without funding its difficult for smaller teams to accommodate a budget towards a full manual auditif you see a typical published report from our platform it details the issues that were found in the history of your project and the ones that were fixed in the later iterations
338936,could work for you
338937,also
338938,it cannot be open source cause it works only with a lot bases which you should upload to it manually these bases are made usually with an own scrapperparserbut there were githubcomjordanwildontelepathygithubcomgrigorichjsdiotgparsertelesint_bot may be a good alternative and mb several tools from here githubcomitismecall911awesometelegramosint
338940,if you are interested in it suggest checking cybdetective ibederov_en officer_cia so much cool info on topic
338942,hi all does anyone know of any method to bridge the sxp token from the bsc network to the eth network
338943,fyi
338944,thanks
338945,however it looks like not all tokens can be bridged though
338946,quantstamp does this i believe
338947,more of an audit firm that does vc then vc that does audit
338948,is anyone interested in the article about foundations
338949,anyone familiar with uniswapv3 lpnftsi am looking to find a way to calculate the ratio of removed assets so far i am taking the liquidity from slot0 of the pool to then analyze how much of each asset was removed this works fine for newer blocks but if i query my archive node for the same pool like a year ago it gives obviously wrong numbers for liquidity is there another easy way to query historical prices than going via slot0
338950,theres a dev agency cyberkio they do auditing for projects as well
338952,responded here already samueldare
338953,can share my 2 cents as a person running tech diligenceadvisory for a vcwith the pipeline reaching up to 1012 projects a month it simply wouldnt be feasible to keep an inhouse auditing team that would be able to cover all of that volume that being said we usually track the design of the product with the team on an ongoing basis to at least identify centralization bottlenecks economic efficiency issues attack vectors etc so a lot of glaring design flaws are addressed even before the team gets to an actual audit
338954,i have a friend who is a front end web programmer and is looking to get into solidity is there maybe a post with some nice info on how to start learning it from scratch
338955,telegraphsoliditycheatsheetspack0320
338956,thank you so much
338957,there are pretty cool threads as well just go through links all materials are in english no need to translate post text but if needed use deeplcom
338960,stop withdrawal of
338961,oh wow thanks i randomly was thinking a protocol was working on this and come to remember it was bancor with v3 i was hoping it was a allsided migration sounds like just outward bound to be hosted in bancor pools
338962,narrator it was not one click
338963,great post thanks what does this meanetherscan shows dex swaps in browser but you cannot get them from their apiim getting results from the etherscan api that i would call dex swaps what am i missing
338964,unless they added something recently i dont think that etherscan api has an endpoint that would give you all the dex records by addressetherscan will display the swaps that happened inside of a tx when you open it in browser but you wont be able to give a request give me all dex trades for x address
338965,you can try to pair up erc20 token transfers by tx hash and see if they were part of the same dex swap or something like that but i found it not very reliable way to get what you need
338968,
338970,given the event name parameters and data how do we know the mapping between parameters and data
338971,nan
338972,take this event for an example how do i know which part of datas maps to values parameter
338973,u need to use the abi to determine the types in the emit
338974,so if i only have the information from the screenshot i cannt figure out the value data right
338975,you can if etherscan shows the contract code and abi
338976,actually i ask this because i try to use duneanalytics logs table to distingushi the value data in the table it shows the raw data in a field
338977,so i cannt use abi directly because dune doesnt support this
338978,it shows there that its 2 uint256 arrays in the data
338979,data has a specific encoding format for dune you can request a contract abi to be added for its data to be decoded
338980,yeah already submit the contract address for decoding just curious whether we can find patterns from the data
338981,the challenge may be theyre arrays rather than other types
338982,no because the output includes the array lengths
338983,are they also stored at data
338984,there are many libraries you can use to decode look at web3 docs
338985,can you link the event youre looking at
338986,
338987,the transferbatch event
338988,thanks the limitation is i try to use a tooldune and a specific tablelogs to distinguish the values
338989,oh interesting are you looking to extract the two last parameters the arrays
338990,yeah by the way the array length is not fixed at 4
338991,
338992,nan
338993,here it turns to 2
338994,i am also not sure whether the two arrays have the same lengthif so i can still extract them
338995,
338996,the bytecode for an array will always start with the length of the array
338997,right these params are not indexed so this applies all parameters without the indexed attribute are abiencoded into the data part of the log youll need t where x has k elements k is assumed to be of type uint256 encx enck encx0 xk1that is the first value will be the length of the array k then k fixedlength pieces containing the values of the array
338998,cactushoes freeatnet got it appreciate your help
338999,if dune has not decoded the values then you need to decode them resources to do this are above dune is just a postgres database afaik
339000,i might be wrong _on how to decode it exactly_ actually always takes a bit of messing about beware of paddings also note that for any x lenencx is a multiple of 32
339002,nan
339003,wow this really helps what do first two rows mean
339004,thats what im trying to figure out as well
339005,are they something related to parameter name
339006,no i think theyre an encoding of 2 dynamicallysized arrays follow i just cant quite figure out how thats done
339007,its array1_len n0 n1 etc array2_len n0 n1 etcnot array1_len array2_len etc etc
339008,i _think_ thats part of the tuple encoding see rule 1 of the encoding t1tk our types are dynamic so we have headx1 headx2 at the start where the value of headxi is the offset of the beginning of tailxi relative to the startso knowing that this data contains 2 dynamicallysized arrays youread the first 32 bytes that tells you the byte offset of the first arrays lengthread the second 32 bytes that tells you the byte offset of the second arrays length
339009,those are byte offsets
339010,sorry yes this is correct
339011,love a good brain teaser on a sunday night
339012,now to read bytecode like plain english
339013,you can find and check event interface in the smart contact
339014,you can decode this using contract abi if you like
339015,do you know of any person whos in theblock team and is on telegram because i have mailed them twice for membership and havent received a reply also cant see any information on website
339023,my man yes they do
339024,
339025,yes they do in a way ser
339026,yes but idk if they do support service on telegram maybe u did smth wrong and they r silent
339033,whats best alternative to uniswap with no slippage limit
339034,you can turn it off on sushi cant you
339035,why would you do that thats like bait for sandwich bots
339036,the tokens where you would want to use more than 49 of slippage generally tends to be tokens with taxes which arent really targetted by bots
339037,49 tax holy shit i thought 10 was bad what degenerate ponzi is this
339038,lol i am not saying 49 tax but only place where i have seen people wanting to use more than that has always been related to token with taxes especially buying when theres a hyped launch
339040,apes gotta apei wonder if this is a good usecase for sushi sushiguard anyhow sushi supports up to 50
339041,on shitcoins there aint sandwich bots
339042,i never put my slippage lower than 49
339043,how serious are you
339044,pretty serious i would say i do the same
339045,de fuk
339046,wtf
339047,not joking
339048,i think ill start working on my bots again
339049,lol i have different wallets for different investments anything on v2 is bought with 49 slippage
339050,i am looking for something with no limit on slippage
339051,i mean you can get inf slippage by going calling contract off etherscan cant you
339052,
339053,on launch contracts aint verified so you cant snipe with etherscan
339054,either you would need bot or swap with no limit on slip
339055,but in all seriousness why set such high slippage i get the tax argument but the ui tells you upfront what the price impact is so whats the point in being overly generous with it
339056,i think they expect stuff to go up more than the slippage in the first few blocks and your tx would fail
339057,unless the thing is so illiquid that it will fail
339058,this
339059,ok makes sense
339060,duckdegen is a v cool name sir
339061,quack
339062,proceeds to make a duck meat joke
339063,on launches when coins do 10000 growth instantly so avoid your txn get failed use 49
339064,even if its possible to use 10000 i will use that
339065,u will get rekt tbh
339066,usually when that happens the next few blocks have massive sells and the infamous bot candle pops up
339067,you need a bot or you cant sell quick
339068,yeah i need a bot working on that currently
339069,hello lobsters does anyone know what these wallets are or extensions
339070,first one is yoroi wallet for ada
339071,last is nami wallet for ada
339072,yeap ty
339073,ty ser
339074,
339075,nan
339076,another fren bites the dust
339077,hope you coping casperdefi
339078,the second is ton crystal for everscale blockchain former ton
339079,
339080,what was it
339081,does anyone know the cairo lang telgram group
339082,its on the discord
339083,
339084,
339085,rough
339086,after some good negotiations and quite a bit of drama potion unlock game is finished
339087,tldr on drama
339090,hard to tldr to be honest without explaining the whole game but basically lots of people arguing stuff for the good of the dao or for the good of the community but those arguments coincidentally also happen to pamp their bags the most
339091,it was like a case study of all the problems and potential of daos i guess or any kind of large scale coordination where parties have some aligned and some diverged interests
339092,herp derp basically
339093,launching into this is ballsy
339094,any idea which l1s logo is the 2nd from the left
339095,fantom terra avalanche polkadot solana near
339097,terra yeap thanks
339098,huh weird to see ftx didnt participate in solana
339099,though i guess alameda being there is pretty much the same thing
339100,alameda ftx
339101,dextools maybe hacked
339102,getting metamask sign requests spammed when on the page
339103,why
339104,source of sign request is a fake url
339105,oh
339106,dont sign anything or connect wallet until more info comes from team already informed them
339107,i am not getting spammed maybe dns based attack
339109,yeah probs will wait for team to look into it but not just me a few people have been raising it in the chat
339110,does anyone know of an options _market_ not vaults that allows uk retail cex or dex is fine
339111,the floor price was quite high between 6 and 20k per nft depending on the rarity which led to not enough people buying and not enough redundancy for the reveal process
339112,hi am new to running nodes considering experimenting one was exploring dappnode is dappnode only for staking or can it be used to send transaction in eth 10polygonfantom chains for arbitrage bot use cases please suggest thanks
339113,hey everyonei am looking for a couple of people using hardware cryptowallets to ask several questions please let me know if you have one or several and are ready to answer a couple of questions i will be very thankful
339114,deribit i think it is the biggest player
339115,yea fca banned crypto derivs for retail in uk tho which i think they comply with
339116,i want to buy research membership but theres no option to buy directly on website
339117,i just filled the interest form on website and its been 3 days but havent received a reply i dont know whats wrong here
339118,hegic
339119,molly is not afraid she says very clearly no kyc
339120,lyra opyn i forget what each does in concrete but both are genealized afaik dunno how easy they r tho
339121,hegic was delisted from binance a few days ago so dyor
339122,are binance listings the new certik
339123,i mean its just delisted because no volume has no relevance to actually using the product
339124,nobody is saying buy the token
339125,i think lyra is amm but ill check both ty
339127,oh nvm i was wrong perfecto
339128,later on some options on oiler i believe and also diver well see quite a few shall be available to choose from
339129,ok i think i see what youre saying here etherscans api endpoints arent a great fit for say writing your own debank because they split the returned data up by type into distinct endpoints and then those endpoints dont quite compose ie i can get all txes for a given address via txlist but if one of those txes is a swap i can only see the outgoing request if i want to know how much usdc was returned for that swap i have to fetch event logs via getlogs which are queryable by block range but not by tx hashso i need more machinery than youd guess and im stuck writing it in only the languages supported by the libraries available none of which are especially tolerable for anything larger than a bash script
339130,lyra is an options amm
339131,already in but thanks
339132,yea im getting confused dw in my head the split was can i sell a single contract or do i have to lp all of them without a choice
339133,you can buy sell calls or puts at the offered strikes and expirations its really straight forward you can also sell position back to the amm to close you can also buy sell fractions
339134,so to answer your question yes u can sell a single contract
339135,wow this is the first time i saw arrington and reputable in one sentence
339136,arent they though therere quite some shitcoin factories managed by firms that call themselves vcs like the infamous master ventures venture builders may be quite profitable during bulls
339137,you should be good with deri its panama based so not regulated by fca nfa tho
339138,were parity smart contract wallet users ever compensated for the devops199 2017 exploit regarding polkadot turned into such a huge financial success a compensation plan would make sense imo anyone any opinions on the matter
339139,pinging muditg since you recently tweeted about it ser
339140,there werent any compensation
339141,parity is behind polkadot right
339142,right
339143,no compensation afaik theres no liable party who should be compensating
339144,they also suffered from this hack their public sale msig also was hacked
339145,300000 eth 1b from public sales stucked forever
339146,do you remember whether it was a big drama back then for ordinary users back then people losing life savings as in todays defi hacks or were people more cautious back then since degen culture was not a thing yet
339147,i think it was same reaction as the reaction to hacks these days maybe slightly worse
339148,i dont really remember any big movement to ask for compensation
339149,only multisigs suffered from this hack that means only power users suffered it was mostly projects multisigs which held salaries and treasury there werent degens culture but icos culture icos have more risk to compare with 4 apr lending now and power users knew this risk
339150,afaik it was parity who lost out not the ico participants they got dot or am i mistakenedit oops i was thinking polkadot devops199 not parity
339151,i think there was one section that demanded a hard fork but overall the people investing in parity were more or less aware of the risks
339152,as a witness to these events can say everyone understood risks
339153,polkadot is developed by parity i think you might be confusing two different incidents that the parity multisig suffered there was a malicious hack against the multisig which often fades in comparison to devops199 perhaps because it isnt nearly as memeable as i accidentally killed it
339154,hey lobsters i will arrive in amsterdam next week and will be happy to visitmeet some of you in person at nice events what events are you planning to go to
339155,shelling point l2
339156,a lobster was hosting an event as well
339157,hey lobsters might be a bit offtopic but hosting an afterparty on 18th of april to close of the first day of eth amsterdamdevconnect drinks will be free bring your langoustines and have some fun apply via the form on the link
339158,i am arriving on tuesday but thanks
339159,thanks a lot mate
339160,also the hack only affected a few wallets iirc other wallet funds were protected by a second hacker group who essentially front run their transactions the devops199 killed all multisigs deployed using paritys infra
339161,anyone here headed to cryptobahamas
339162,
339163,wow this is so ass nathan_vdh
339164,inb4 the ask to buy you
339165,how will that prevent getting affected by copyrighttrademarkother violations
339166,ichis rari pool is rekt isnt it
339167,
339168,bots not liquidating
339169,yeah it is
339170,cant wait for all the copycats that inevitably end the exact same way
339171,if you search for aaaaaaaaaa in this chat only ivangbi shows up dating back to 2020 sir is there a conspiracy
339172,i am still not sure what ichi does do you essentially provide 2 dollars worth of value to mint 1 onebtc
339173,not sure the search function looks for usernames
339174,nah its provide 20 of wbtc 80 usdc get 100 onebtc
339176,kinda like original frax mechanism except using random other tokens instead of fxs and storing them in a vault indefinitely instead of burning
339177,the stablecoins themselves are not really the ponzi chaining degen borrowing on rari from the team into constantly increasing huge buy wall on uniswap v3 is the ponzi
339178,small correction the ratio can be updated later on by governance 8020 is just the default i believei did some work for them recently
339179,what is the ponzi there
339180,guyz i research dao2dao interactions and have a question why daos dont use their assets from treasury in defi ie if a dao has eth in treasury it can be used in steth iceth etc are there any issues
339181,the underlying tech angel vaults
339182,gm do you mean pol protocol owned liquidity implementations arxivorgpdf220206541pdf
339183,lobster dao was planning something similar but yet not come up with a proposal was discussed here lobsterdao
339184,imo it brings certain risks to the holy treasury money which can result in bad case of loosing money with a possible hack but this is a cool way of dao2dao collaborration why not
339185,my questions more about treasury management if a dao hold some assets in treasury why they dont earn additional yield in defi
339186,ive seen dhedge and llama solutions but they are not so successful and there can be a problem risk good point no one wants to lose funds for years of development
339187,they buy us just to fire me
339188,chad move tho
339189,which part though
339190,the part where protocol owned liquidity is managed by the team poorly clearly and they allow borrowing against 85 value of the protocols token in a permissionless fuse pool
339191,hey sal_ash have sent you dm
339192,what is how um if they own the liquidity isnt it their business what to do with it that aside what would be the proper management for youfor the second one im vaguely familiar with what rari is but cant anyone create whatever they want as they see fit
339193,yeah the 85 ltv was waaaaay too aggressive
339194,am i only cofounder or builder that observe researchers at vcs are lack of knowledge about defi or the blockchain
339195,no many of them seem to miss a lot of knowledge but it obviously depends on who you talk to
339196,how to find or talk some one who really understand tech etc it might a dump question but l could not find
339197,see some responses from here tldr unless you have your own connections you just build and try to grow your product narrative and then they come in later perhaps if you would need them at all then rata0x
339198,definitely v3 also makes it way harder for rari or equivalents to give out onesizefitsall advice on sane parameters not that people would follow them anyway
339199,guyswe are building a hopefully better version of duneif you have an experience making analytics therecould you ping me in direct messagewant to ask few questions

339215,oh my f god how brainfucked are they there is literally only scam in there 99

339218,list shitcoin direct correlation to ownership
339219,being content
339220,their listing strat is does the coin cost less than 1 to purchase ok retail will love this
339221,
339222,the separation of ownership from management is the most destructive thing ever to happen to mankind
339223,hey ive used your product before am familiar with most of the tools out there
339224,we cant list nonscams sorry
339225,i want to know who is willing to market make drep on coinbase orderbooks i want to sit down with them and ask why
339226,also how
339227,if retail have to pay more than 1hour min wage to own 1 token its a scam sorry
339228,head of coinbase listing is definitely a top tier shitcoiner
339229,theres some truth to that you should read kings of crypto and it talks about how in the early days of coinbase there were two paths to travel 1 being institutionfocused or 2 list as many coins as possible
339230,
339231,i guess we see which path it chose
339232,jesus
339233,yeah they are making howtobuy articles for memecoins
339234,lol imagine listing all those shitcoins in bear lol
339235,would make sense if they also create derivs
339236,look at stock price

339247,looks like
339248,coinbase cant be serious about that one
339249,its not even about marketcaps its about due diligence there are literally projects that scammed their communities and didnt do anything for years and now they are in the list
339253,big scam spl tokens on the solana networkapricot financeit may be on orca or raydium but certainly not coinbase
339254,for anyone interested in the algod do kwon luna wager we did some research on analyzing each side of the bet using options pricing
339256,
339257,uniswap not showing liquidity provided by the connected wallet
339258,i refreshed many times
339259,resetting my browser settings always seems to help when stuff like that happens
339260,question spurred from the recent ichi shenanigansare there lending markets that take the dex liquidity depth into account as welleuler_mab maybe knows
339261,we started working on something to cover these cases with an insurance but the reality is that having people use borrowed assets as exit liquidity is not easy to approach even when you are controlling the lending pool
339262,so either you have a very low ltv and pray for depth and no surprising drawdowns or you need to be able to predict future market movements track the deposits etc
339263,clearing cache
339264,wasnt the issue allowing such high collateralization on an illiquid token
339265,risk of massive price swings and high leverage
339266,which we researched for a couple months then came to the conclusion that it was too complicated
339267,gotcha ty for sharing your experience noodling on it
339268,shot in the dark here but does anyone know how to add a metamask link to add a token in gitbook
339269,it is not possible cuz u cant add custom javascript and call it inside gitbook
339271,hey thanks for the response i figured that was the case
339272,anyone from alliancedao team around here
339273,
339274,i think euler has ratings depending on uni v3 liquidity
339277,ratings are cool i was wondering if thered be a way to cap deposits based on dex depthif ur alrdy using a uni v3 oracle presumably thats where liquidation is gonna happen so taking that into account seems useful
339278,i mean you could try to implement whatever they did off chain on chain and use it
339279,they get their rating by amount of you need to manipulate a 30 twap
339281,any good resources to learn how i can detect a new erc20 is deployed on the main net and whether they added liquidity to sushiswap or uni
339282,its as almost if the market has gone down only in the past 100 days lol
339283,uni v3 robo balancers will never work
339284,orly
339285,can i add a hint for people posting hereif you are going to share a twitter link delete everything after the tthe extra characters are what twitter uses to track you and link you to the people who click the linkfor privacy reasons you should delete the t part
339286,
339287,is zach segal a gpt3 bot maybe
339288,you under estimate gpt3 ser
339289,rather a guy with very deep pockets imo
339290,damn thanks for this info never thought what the heck are those symbols
339291,anyone happen to know why neither dai nor fei seem to support any of the liquid staked eth derivatives
339292,could go even a step further actually for increased capital efficiency and use aave deposited liquid staked eth or ethsteth liquidity from a dex extra contract risky obviously but it would be substantially more capital efficient
339293,wrapping around aave and compound is 2018 ser they wont match nor is it their use case so no shade thrown the efficiency yet safely enough still that will be w gearbox v2 not shilling per se yes but sharing a slide which explains the differences usp you can go even 10x ethsteth r tight
339294,always happy to proved a shilling opportunity so then should dai and fei and the other decentralized stables at gearbox staked eth as a collateral type that would seem way more efficient than using vanilla eth
339295,an asset that is in the allowedlist automatically is a collateral too so if i understand you right yes you can do that in v2 early june already
339296,yeah im just wondering why fei didnt use a staked eth version when they launched dais been around too long but seems like fei had the perfect opportunity
339297,also theres no bridges that can support steth because of the rebase correct or at least it wouldnt stay pegged to 1 eth
339298,theres wrapped version wsteth for that have not looked at other l2s but it exists on solana
339299,sweet thanks ill have to check that out wonder how the rebase works across the bridge
339300,oh never mind wsteth is wrapped and is a share of a pool not 11 pegged so thats how
339301,still cool but not quite what i had in mind if its bridged im guessing someone is arbing that back and forth i dont see a way to redeem the reward without doing it on the base layer wonder if the bridge is absorbing that
339302,keen to chat with people that manage dao treasuries pls dm if you are or know someone
339303,
339304,im glad i came here and checked out the conversation that is going on i think this is exactly what im looking to do take some steth and farm with that yet have eth available afterwards is there an article or blog to help me understand how to do this with gearbox
339305,hey folks whats the best api to get usd prices for any asset its turning out to be a harder problem than i thought it was lol
339308,
339310,hi lobsters i am building on a small nft platform that loads data directly from the nfts tokenuriis there a security concern with showing anyones abitrary nft metadataimage directly to users the linked image could contain eg some malicious js inside an svg file for that case i am currently using dompurify before showing it also i have a setting to disable external content globally anything else to watch out for
339311,yes there is a security concern looksrare now requires clicktoview
339312,guyz what is the best way to track crypto deposits to the website creating address for each user and adding balance on deposit to this address or to add wallet connection and keeping track of deposits from specified address or is there something better
339313,zapper debank
339314,zerion
339317,zapper
339318,
339320,they all seem to be designed to track someones address what i meant was that i need to accept crypto deposits to my site so that the balance on the site increases from the users crypto deposit
339321,they deposite to some contract am i right then you can display value deposited to contract
339322,wow did my question got deletedmoderated for asking how to send sol from phantom wallet back to binance
339323,or rather did someone succeeded in sending usdcstables out from sol network to other evm chains
339325,i removed it after u found the answer its a support question nothing of interest to keep here
339326,same for me need to dig a bit deeper to figure this out exactly
339327,can also use halxyz triggers
339332,is anybody experienced in building the backend doing web3 callin the past i did massive web3 call on the backend and all txs were stuck whats the best way to avoid thisand where can i buy fast rpc node
339333,make sure about nonce
339334,you can get your own custom rpc w infura alternatively flashbots is popular but yeah if things are stuck that might be a nonce issue or gas estimation issue which is separate
339335,you can get good estimates of gas using node apis let me look it up for you
339336,
339337,alright thanks
339338,also a fast rpc your own node specifically only is useful when reading from mempool if youre just submitting a few tx alchemyinfura is just fine but it depends on your specific usecase id say
339339,got it duckdegen is there any simpler example like web3 call by polling
339342,does anyone have problem with os listings
339343,for gas estimates nothing stops you from building that call in an interval so yes
339344,im having a discussion toward voting and trustless systems with people on another server and id love to learn more does blockchain tech with the pub priv keys system and its tamperproof aspect having any upside vs centralized systems secure enclave processing the first that comes in my mind is about data leaks risk do you have any articles i can read up im a complete noob in those topic but interested to learn more especially when it comes to decentralized id related researches
339346,i mean its just a promise you can infinite loop the promise every time it resolves and voila you have your polling ive noticed that at the beginning of a block gas is cheaper than towards the end of the block so maybe overbid by a small bit if you want to be included asap
339347,
339348,yeah both for gas estimations and nonce
339349,nonce is entirely on your side gas estimates its a momentary snapshot just build a loop for it and youll be fine
339350,
339351,ok finally usdc pumpedare u happy ivangbi now
339352,and thats why blackrock took down snapshot bc of a subdomain wow

339366,hi guys i know that vitalik came up with the idea of amms the first publication if found to this topics is is anyone aware of something more citable in academic terms
339367,my suggestion is
339368,it seems like its most comprehensive overview article about different dex modelsespecially worth to mention that it has 5 pages with reference articlesand if you are interested in pol protocol owned liquidity with amms and pmms i suggest to take a look at
339369,thanks
339370,
339371,congrats julian
339372,how would you guys recommend approaching a web3 project is there a good established route to take ie start with whitepaper start attracting team get funding im technical so i can spin up something quick but there are other aspects that are beyond me and im a noob in business
339373,thank you sorry i know there is no shilling and stuff like that but thought it was relevant for this group for defi crosschain etc
339374,gm here is a daodefi project start checklist
339375,maybe the reddit advertising part needs update dont know what subs they can be replaced with but cryptomoonshots and similar subs are just bot infested billboards that no one looks at
339376,starting from building product by yourself going to every hackaton for find accomplices proceed buidling together and simultaneously looking for backers
339377,if anything they reduce the credibility of a project at this point i avoid things on there

339390,ichi v2
339391,the heck is elephant money lol
339392,given avaxsolanafantom exist to what extent are ruggers on bsc now just using the filtering mechanism that 419 scammers use
339393,like you purposely write a horrible email so that the only people who would reply are those easily scammed
339394,you purposely build on bsc to get the most ruggable subhuman apes
339395,kinda harsh honestly but i dont think you are that far off
339396,literally every one of my chats is asking this how tf did they amass 500m when nobody ever heard of them
339397,maybe 500m is like 490m of elephant that is trading at 1 on like 50k of liquidity on pancakebakefakelakeswap
339398,no it actually has huge liqudity
339399,20m liquidity even after the exploit
339400,they urgently need to rebrand and start up on a new one money is rats
339401,wow
339402,i will never understand the bsc ecosystem
339403,wow 20m after hack at a 500m marketcap is quite an outlier for bsc
339404,bcoz its not
339405,yeah bsc is weird af
339406,look at that liquidity aswell
339407,and chart
339408,question please whats the minimum staking amount to receive 300 vested gro tokens is there one
339409,anyone in here a beast with data visualization and familiar with sigma andor high charts dm me if so
339410,
339411,no min threshold afaik
339412,any way to find out which protocol holds the most cvx like a ranking
339413,that seems a bit sketch a major security vulnerability of whole discord infrastructure if its actually possible

339415,i see information is delayed any way to update it more frequently
339416,start with attracting cofounders building mvp then get funding create social channels finish development then take audit and launch imo dont waste your time writing wp before building mvp do it along the way

339421,hello everyone are you guys aware about any tool to do some automated web3 tests user interactions something like datadog selenium but for web3 dapps
339422,honey pot artificial price500m cap dont mean they have 500m liquidity
339423,thx
339425,nan
339428,does anyone know if the sushiswap trident contracts are already live on mainnet for different chains and where could i find them thanks in advance
339429,
339431,no idea ser i didnt even look at the details just saw 500m hacked and i thought how does a protocol that i havent even heard of have 500m and then i was like oh its on bsc clown world nvm
339432,it had high liquidity even after hack it had around 20 mil
339433,ur more like me everyday
339434,soon you wont look at any docs
339435,you truly have to be deranged to look at docs for projects on bsc ser
339436,oh its bsc
339437,yes but if it has a whitepaper not just docs it must be legit
339438,amplice this man makes convincing point
339439,alpaca finance is on bsc but it has pretty good and comprehensive docs actually
339440,stop building start memeing
339441,is that because they lost their devs
339442,i believe its just for fun and memorise

339448,
339449,morning note for folks looking for a recap
339450,bad debt isnt new for most sers here but i find the actual issues interesting
339451,im trying to understand how some collateral is being released from this bad debt
339452,i see liquidations coming in all day the pool creators stopped all the borrowing so even if utilization drops and it did theres no way to borrow to your ltv and salvage that
339453,euler_mab any ideas
339454,um hasnt compound made 50m in the entirety of its existence how does this make any sort of dent on a meaningful amount of bad debt
339455,i should sue my employer for emotional damages for forcing me to do this
339456,easy they dont get to a point where they have bad debt by having a tight control of tokens being used as collateral
339457,well yes but then the whole reserve business borders on mere decorative busywork
339458,dont do it
339459,but you actually dont need to read the docs just pretend u did i still remember this
339460,tbh in 3 years thats quite a lot by startup standards the question is more about scaling
339461,the replies lol
339462,still bitter they never gave based the credit for the whitepaper
339463,alls well that ends well
339464,ill have your correction within the hour ser
339465,provided i can still access gitbook im sure you all know the struggle
339466,too little too late my fren based is ded now thanks to your scathing report
339469,anyone here from optimism team need connect
339470,sers blz stop memezes
339471,redacted the last past sowwy
339472,on euler 23 of all interest paid by borrowers goes to the reserves current borrowing apy averages 75 so if the protocol gets to 3b borrowed it will generate 50m in a year 2 of all repaid debts during liquidations go to the protocol too that is likely to be up to 10m in a year when the protocol hits full steam all of that gets auto deposited into euler itself and earns compound interest growing exponentially the protocol will then own its own liquidity and may even reduce its dependency on ordinary lenders increasing its share of the interest paid further
339473,
339475,using some sort of mev bot
339477,curious isnt depositing the reserve half the reason ichi is currently rekt
339478,in the event of this baddebtinducing bank run should the protocol end up being the last to exit youre back to square one no
339480,
339481,
339482,what is this about
339483,my team did not go to ethdenver and hired twocause we were working
339484,check my post about the purpose of reserves the whole point of reserves is that they can be withdrawn providing they are greater than or equal to the total bad debt in a pool they should allow all lenders to withdraw
339485,depositing cvx lp tokens and others cvxfxs cvxcrv into rari for borrowing fei
339486,should have done it for ucrv
339488,i guess this gets asked frequently so mods delete if its spam but wheres a good place to get stable yields now high preference for fuzzy implied airdrop yields like hopbrahmaother projects without tokens yet i wanted to deposit in brahma but vault is fullpreferably on eth or eth l2
339490,
339491,maker dai does have a steth vault
339492,adjoints bulletproofs wonder if stephen diehl will tweet about this as a conspiracy by the cryptocurrency community to discredit his work
339493,so much alpha in this tweet about daos
339494,
339495,looks like somebody buy the dip
339496,fdv 50m looks like the real dip nowadays
339497,long explanation for a rugpull
339499,does anyone know a white hat my friend had his account comprised and it seems like theyre trying to unwind one of his positions to take his collateral if this isnt appropriate feel free to delete
339500,that post is what i responded to the first time though provided its greater yes of course if its greater the conclusion is straightforward that is not really noteworthy but using compound or even aave as a baseline the numbers do not add up doubling the average diverted to the reserve will certainly help but only just
339501,hey folks is there an easy preferably open source way to do the equivalent of what debank does but into a csv formatessentially grab a few different wallets over multiple chains and extract all monetary txs for accounting purposes
339502,afaik theres no export to csv option on debank
339503,
339504,zapper has csv
339505,best try on flashbots discordi remember something simmilar available there
339506,thanks boss

339530,hi guys we got hacked i traced down the account and found that it is associated with a binance hot wallet is there anyway to trace it downreport it or get the identity of person behind
339531,try contacting binance support ig
339532,yes l can help binance wont help if it is not a personal wallet but write them with evidences
339536,such a great help thanks rata0x
339537,eip1167 is one of the most underrated eips in existencewere introducing it to revest following the exploit that impacted us on the 27th of march already in use in our liquid vecrv solution we can use the oz clonessol contract to figure out what address a given fnft financial nft will produce if we use its nft id as a the salt for deploying a smart wallet that means that we can send tokens from a user to that address without deploying any bytecode at said address sandboxes value so that even if you could convince an fnft it was worth more than it should be insolvency which is how the exploit that hit us worked you cant withdraw more tokens than exist at your smart wallet address when it comes time to withdraw deploy a cloned smart wallet to that address using eip1167 to save on bytecode retrieve the stored value then call selfdestruct on the smart wallet in the same transaction equivalent of computinginmemory without ever writing to storage most of the time there is no bytecode at the addresses where value is storedsharing this because most people have never heard of this eip and it really is incredible
339538,class action lawsuit accuses uniswap labs its investors of allowing fraudulent activity on the dex protocol
339539,they dared to allow me make decisions for myself illegal
339540,i dont think that lawsuit will be a problem especially there are top tier lawyers such as katie haun
339541,elie from erc721rorg here happy to answer any questions
339542,from april 5 2021 through the present the class period uniswap has offeredand sold unregistered securities including ethereummax bezoge earth matrix samuraialphawolf finance rocket bunny and boombabyio collectively the tokens lol
339543,so she got rekt buying shitcoins and is now sueing uniswap high quality shitpost really
339544,if profit it was all them if scammed then its all protocols fault lol
339545,hate to see it
339546,it sort of tracks with tradfi logic though not good
339547,v cool sir
339548,my profit your blame
339551,whats more rekt is having to own up and dox yourself as a buyer of those coins

339573,anyone has a overview of optimism protocols is there a page for it or anything vfat like
339574,id say defillama
339575,ye this i figured hence i said vfat like more interested in farmingapy over there as i dont see much of another usecase for it in general d
339576,idk how relevant this is but according sto sone estimates ecdsa will be vulnerable to quantum attacks in possibily even 10 years i found a qa page about it this issue hits at the core of bitcoin and ethereum as well it is important at least fot bitcoin imo to start acting on it right now
339577,there is some academic work done on it from 4 years agp but afaik no bip yet

339588,
339589,either way this is all good theater for the start of his own fork all along he could say he tried here is my app which btw funded itself with his twtr investment and the pumps he caused

339593,makes sense tbh
339594,if youre worth hundreds of billions what are you even gonna do with that
339595,im surprised not more billionaires pull these stunts
339596,leveraged buyout no
339597,not everyone is keen on gambling half their nw on a twitter

339599,wen elon presidential candidate
339600,at current rate 2032
339602,elon never really cared he doesnt mind going all in he gambled it all with spacex and tesla previously
339604,how much has gov influence been used on twitter in its current state and you think being private will be less
339605,genuine government interference not that much its mostly court of public opinion that drives twitter as company to censor stuff not really actual courts so in some sense this could make a difference
339606,sers thats a bit too much couch crap fun news ok move on done
339607,hmm can a company go private again i did not know it was possible
339608,the company just needs to buy everyones bags
339610,yep
339611,big names done it more than once

339637,yea was wondering too thats why share the post n lets others big brains here check it out lol
339638,yea they migrate from boba to ava
339639,his vc invested in uxd right
339640,ohm he deleted it
339641,lightly edited
339642,ohm wasnt even a stablecoin was the consensus article really the only good thing that came out of multicoin
339643,well this one is definitely not good
339644,lol feels like he found a way to dump his 10 while keeping his based image
339645,he wants to make it private so no
339646,its an offer with a threat in it its never going to be accepted
339647,either it gets accepted and he will run twitter into the ground or he has an easy out by saying well i tried but they said no meanwhile price has pumped because of his shenanigans and he comes out all the richer for it and dumps his stock on peoples heads on the way out

339659,everything we need is reputation system for metamask and other web3 wallets showing warnings and reputation status of smart contractdomain users are interacting with
339660,1 lobs 1 reputation
339661,but probably if you are experienced user the metamask ui is already perfectly showing you what are you doing that will be a huge problem for new users who just saw a widget and run signing the transaction
339662,something like deepdao according to the activities in a dao for voting and discussion
339663,reputation is something accumulated over time
339664,or positionsrecord in defi protocols for uncollateralled lending
339665,it would be great to tip not only the validators but also the smarcontract and use it as rating
339666,now projects track only users wallets for rating arcx xmargin degenscore but i havent seen any projects which track smart contracts projects and deployers only etherscan do
339667,using reputation as a collateral
339668,reputation for risk rating moreover something like sponsor credit
339669,anyone familiar with gnosis knows if its possible to do the following there is a vault with tresshold of 4 signers all 4 sign offchain someone else that is not a signer submit the tx onchain
339670,truefi maple clearpool goldfinch already do
339671,centralized onboarding for borrowers during kyc its kind of reputation as collateral
339672,not really im not sure about clearpools onboarding but all of the other protocols mentioned used more formal underwriting methods not repuation for credit decision there are some other projects like spectral finance sublime and maybe one or two others that are trying to do repuation based lending to more retail uers
339673,right there are not only reputation in the game but some legal stuff
339674,it is yes
339675,not through the ui right
339676,no the exec has to be done by contract
339677,and when some borrowerswintermute alameda will have good traction years without default they will be able to borrow direct from protocols
339678,also teller
339679,wen live
339680,my teller nft even cannot borrow from their pool
339682,do we need another reputation system to trust the reputation system
339683,i has 2
339684,it seems like decentralized systems are intending to fractalization alsolike we have eth consensus but also l2l1 evm consensus also bridge consensus and also oracles consensus also dapp multisig consensus and so onsame fractalizaion effect you can see in biologychemistryphysics natural science
339685,trust me
339686,defi onchain fintech
339687,sure time to start 1inch of reputation systems
339688,sure but the trust rating for protocols would be pretty useful
339689,what if lobsters could upvote or downvote projects based on trust
339690,and only lobsters
339691,lobs social credit scoring
339692,we can start from lobs loyalty rating on arcxmoney
339693,what is arcx
339694,onchain credit
339695,oh my god what are the price predictions
339696,
339698,this was always the theory lowkey tho no or maybe psyops
339699,i think it was hacks like that were more than 1 computer is compromised and its not a low hanging fruit you start thinking of bigger groups it has been a theory that nk is getting a lot of income for the countries economy from crypto hacks they are a persistent threat actor to every protocol basicallynk mean has a bug bounty please responsible disclosure if you are reading this lol
339700,lol the best part is nk can legalize this money by confiscating it from thieves and poof clean crypto
339701,should check karmabrahmafi
339703,trying to do onchain reputation along with degenscrore to rank wallets
339705,we added karma voting to vault proposals as well to test things out very experimental approach
339707,friends please read pinned message with chat rulestry to avoid spamming here lol lmao emojis i love this project ty and etcuse tg reactions insteadthanks
339708,yeah i rmbr changellyshapeshiftetc and others had it in 2017 for cross chain swaps
339709,could you pay a bug bounty to nk if they disclosed wouldnt the feds come after you for sanctions violations
339710,hey yall working on building a standard to increase the accessibility of the space the goal is getting together working groups to really flesh out the smart contract list standards i want to make sure projects have the opportunity to be represented like trader joe pangolin uniswap yearn beefi platypus curve alpha finance halborn benqi certik avme aave frax terra polkadot etc etci have already started engaging with coinbase wallet engineering and 0xngmi from defillama lets build something together that can change how ppl interact with the spacethis is a platform and project agnostic piece of work being led by fihub fihub is developing a defi dashboard that provides incentive programs for earning while actively learning a smart contract list standard can provide broad accessibility that takes token lists to the next levelthis is a reference to the initial introduction of smart contract liststhis is the 1st presentation on smart contract listsworking on getting the videoreach out to me if you are interested in helping bring to being part of a working group and get invited to the fihub working discord
339711,just some nonhonest yield farming
339712,good question probably not but i doubt they will submit through immunefi via north koreas army user hehe
339713,do us sanctions only apply to us residents or for nonus too had virgil griffith been a swiss passport holder would he still be prosecuted by us doj
339714,texas alabama securities regulators serve a casino nft scheme ceaseanddesists
339715,hey mates we have developed a multichain nft marketplace for gamers first we made and wrote it for ourselves then we realized that we can open it for any game so far we added two networks bnb and polygon but next month we will launch support for other blockchains eth near solana avalanche etcvery interesting to know your opinion how much interesting this product will be for players and does the market need it we see it as steam on blockchain maybe you can give some recommendations some unique features smart nft portfolio management allows you to watch pl on your nfts multichainfichering your project on the home pagei would really like to know the opinion of game project founders and other defigamifi market professionalshere is a link to the product gmartio
339716,yes
339717,still could be abused
339718,who would check the list everytime
339719,airdrop time
339720,
339721,not really news you can take almost any token listed to coinbase and analyze volumes and price action and it is crystal clear there are plenty of insiders out there witnessed multiple times also strange questions from tokens discord where to buy otc as much as possible just few days prior ofc leak could be in both ends and most likely is
339722,erc721o intro
339723,really old repost sir
339724,
339725,the timing of this announcement coincides well with virgil griffiths sentencing
339726,
339730,
339731,
339732,
339733,github has deleted libmdbx repo likely because of us sanctions say hello to brave new world
339735,what sanctions did it violate
339736,the future will be positivefrom mdbx readme
339737,
339738,hmm why is the date on this april 16 2021
339739,bc us doesnt like foreign infosec and sanctioned pt last year not connected to this war
339740,and maybe github only started to care and searchdestroy just now under us pressure
339742,
339743,fucking inbreds attacking again
339744,no
339745,interesting stuff
339747,was this some arb or just a fat whale
339748,
339749,but he ended up with 100 eth less wouldnt it have been better to stake the eth with lido to get 11
339750,indeed it would
339751,what a braindead thread omg
339752,where are you guys farming atm stables and eth
339754,rl job ftm stuff
339756,this revival of omnichain is very interesting i think its worth seeing where it goes
339757,no restrictions from lido on max size staking maybe not so trivial to spin up validators for 50k eth
339758,lido deploys all eth over time due to how the staking queue works anyway but eth in the queue will still earn staking rewards
339759,so unless steth trades at a discount you are always better off depositing with lido directly
339760,with rokectpool you cant do this trick need to have extra available validators first
339761,which till now seems to be a total scam raised millions selling nfts which are totally useless since you still cant borrow against them
339762,currently looking through uniswap v3 liquidity stuff anyone know why the same logic in different contracts thrown within the same tx show considerable differences amount1 i would understand that a regular off by one can happen and it does often but off by 3
339763,yea they failed to boost from cold start the paid nft collateral initially can be treat as its value base and gratully move to general collateral with some value consensus to borrow from the pool but now they dont provide enough liquidity for nft lending
339764,anyone know their investor the discord mods dont seem to know anything regarding roadmap
339765,probably some whale arbitraging anchors incentives
339768,wen elon
339769,
339770,
339771,those kind of measures have no impact cant people transfer their assets to a non blacklisted address and then use it anyway as long as those blacklists are not recursivetreelike and updated in absolute realtime which is not possible this wont make a difference
339772,wen fork too soon
339773,not forkworthy also forking something like tornado hurts the privacy of both the original and the forks users the model depends on having as many deposits from different entities as possible
339774,lf the contract is not immutable then anymore there is a way of blacklist hacks etc too
339775,yes but theres a problem if the model changes to good deposits only
339776,seemingly small but give an inch and they take a mile whats next relayers start running a script that verifies youre good or sufficiently kycd somewhere or maybe the relayers have been taken over already a la tor hyperbole maybe
339777,that would be a form of whitelisting and basically render the whole point of tornado obsolete
339778,disgusting what an absolutely terrible standard to set
339779,but generally i agree imho there is too much organizational structure behind tornado already it makes them vulnerable this kind of stuff is best deployed once anonymously and immutable
339780,shouldve gotten rid of the inperson leverage while they were ahead
339781,i think tornado should stay regulator complaint though otherwise addresses interacted with tornado would be banned from cexes thus leaving almost no easy way to stay anonymous and still have ability to cash out money from the internet to the cash
339782,it by definition can not be regulator compliant because it does the very thing regulators can not handle obfuscation of funds
339783,thats why this move is kind of odd it does not do anything and everyone involved should be aware that they can not do more without canceling the whole thing
339784,they do provide some services to be regulator compliant though
339785,window dressing
339786,aaaaaand is a case in point as to why people will unironically be okay with that
339787,yeah and thats good as long as the regulators are okay with the way tornado currently is and one can use it freely
339788,people who are unironically okay with this stuff are not users of tornado it makes no sense
339789,youd be surprised
339790,people send tokens from exchanges to darknets
339791,well they can use it but they dont need it
339792,yes thats exactly what the ronin bridge exploiters are doing right now they blacklisted their address but they just transfer eth to other addresses and use tornado from there on
339793,yeh at least not that long ago wh had something like 2030 of tx coming directly from coinbase
339794,i mean the best way is to solve this problem is actually rebuild regulations because it makes no sense to provide proof of funds to whoever asks just because they can put you in jail if you wont do that but lets leave it for the other discussions
339795,nor are they supporters of privacy or censorship resistant platforms imho
339796,the best way to solve the problem is to make it irrelevant
339797,you are assuming that the structures in charge of regulation are acting in good faith
339798,i am not actually i just dont see a way to avoid regulations currently
339799,not kowtowing into some weird frankenstein monster
339800,funnily that sanctions oracle is operated by an eoa id think twice before relying on it
339801,then it should be clear that there will be no rebuilding of regulations in a way that tolerates products like tornado the whole goal is to get control over people and i can not recall any meaningful reversal of regulations into the opposite direction but lets not reopen this conversation it tends to become spammy
339802,its easy just dont integrate narcware into your products and dont have backdoors which can be abused
339803,it is not that easy in order to be able to do that the maintainers need to be protected otherwise they will go after them i doubt the tornado people are doing this because it aligns with their vision of the product
339804,so as a maintainer you basically have to be absolutely anonymous to an extent where law enforcement can not track you down thats very tricky these days and gets more tricky every day
339805,unfortunately we need to fight to protect maintainers eg
339806,the only protection is for them to be absolutely anonymous and the software to be as immutable and decentralized as possible running some sort of central twitter account already is problematic imho tricky topic basically any communication you do online no matter how small will open a window for you to be identified
339807,and that is why i keep mentioning liquity
339808,having things not depend on a single maintainer could be a part of the solution work should also be set up in a way allowing some churn to protect people leaving when things become too heated for them everyone has a different perception of risks but there is nothing preventing ideas from proliferating
339809,it may not be practical for every project but that is one way when theres nothing to strongarm into compliance everything else more or less solves itself
339810,also this oracle is pretty much useless pretty sure chainalysis knows this whats the idea a v2 with a script for their relayers to track transfers
339811,its probably to tell some regulatory boomers look we comply with the holy sanction list really silly if you think about it it shows that at some point someone really does not get how stuff works
339812,ok i am growing my own weed now s
339813,so the code is freedom of speech rule will have a big
339814,good speech only as determined by the current fads
339815,yes i think so too
339817,in amsterdam tenderly is doing few workshops so for all the devz coming this one can be interesting
339818,great platform set of tools3 wrote a blogpost about them a while agoofficerciamediumcomtenderlyappaswisspocketknifefortheweb3developer89bb904bee46
339819,yea tenderly is fucking amazing one of the best infra products out there
339820,great article btw farm42
339821,oh wow there are people really believing u do good things bogdanhabic
339822,hey anyone know a good product designer
339823,anyone here can use metamask ledger on polygon my ledger didnt display txs detail to confirm
339824,someone should make an inflation linked stablecoin backed 11 by tips bonds
339825,so that i can put my into that instead of weakening dollar
339826,oh wait looks like frax did it already lol
339827,
339828,lol did he just propose a blocksize of a gb
339829,allhope to see everyone in ams
339830,close and open the browser again sometimes it happens to me and i fix it that way
339832,also deactivate the extension and reactivate if it doesnt work
339833,
339834,gm lobster fam a good friend of mine created arcadenft you might have seen his sick vids on tw today they dropped meta dragonsin a nutshell they designed an innovative gaming smart contract storing all data scores assets wins and eth prize pools on chain the arena contract aka the first smart contract ever that allows competitive p2e mmo environment with immutable prize pools fueled by 100 of secondary sales its basically infinitely scalable to compete and win eth when connected with mm totally permissionless players earn eth their nft evolve dynamically based on outcomepretty epic stuff they need help spreading the word so they offer the lobsters half price mints of the metadragonznft for whoever is downif u down go ahead and mint and link addy in dm to reimburse mint fees
339835,nan
339836,do you know how the gaming stuff is done techwiseis it just chainlink vrf or smth of the sort
339837,its a bracket smart contract the actual gaming part is done off chain tho
339838,wait i link u the deets
339848,this is for nft_avenues sers thx
339851,sirs can someone explain this tweet what is a mev searcher
339852,
339853,mev searcher is a flashbot term for users who are looking for fast and private execution of certain transactions typically some kind of mev bot
339854,though i have seen someone with the tag duckdegen around here maybe he is the one from the note and can explain it better
339855,thanks for explaining sir
339856,i have a question on the l2 platforms like arbitrumare they native tokens being used like eth and also do you guys like metis is that an l1 or l2
339857,hey yo anyone from lens protocol here
339858,yep how can i help
339859,lovely dming you
339863,after voting how can we check if ours votes are in i dont see a tx going out from my wallet and votes section is also not showing my address
339865,hackernews ten members of international stock manipulation ring charged in manhattan
339867,i thought zefram wasis building owensea with xmons
339868,interesting that you can build aspiring billion dollar protocol competitors part time a new world indeed
339869,zefram is one of the few people i trust to multitask
339870,based zefram innit
339871,in my experience some devs just need multiple things to tinker on like if u run up against a wall then u work on sth else while the problem sits in the bakc of your mind then it resolves and u switch back
339872,also a 1010 dev contributooooring part time to your project is probably a bigger value add by some degree than a 610 dev working full time the rating out of 10 is a log scale or sth close to it
339875,will the next defi primitive require someone who knows the limits of theoretical computer science as well grand mathematician of evm whose mapped everything as a turingcomplete machine or will it just be a social media reprobate brotheren with an nft pfp
339876,or a team of ppl just building things they like
339877,uh huh thats true just a group of buds
339879,just finished watching this pretty ambitious of them
339880,the arbitrum voting is so fishy
339881,how fishy
339882,top 1 is yield protocol
339884,some funny things
339887,if you were to open a web storefront and wanted to accept crypto what would you guys use i did a search on github and found btcpayserver wondering whether this community had any positive or negative experiences i did search this chat and couldnt find anything concrete thank you
339888,something with1 privacy so my purchases cannot be trackedor2 crypto that i am bearish about such as usd usdcusdtustetc
339889,yes stablecoins seem to be the way to go but that usually means erc20 which means gas
339890,which is probably why im seeing btc lightning the most due to tx fees volatility be damned
339891,
339892,people just hunting for airdrops and these protocols are giving away tokensnfts to get votes
339893,many projects with vc backing are top voting i dont think that is a coincidence
339895,is there any service that you can paste smart contract address and it shows you project it belongs
339897,
339898,most sites have stable coin options with multiple chains ive seen pay with usdc on polygon avax and fantom before
339900,
339901,tweet is deleted
339902,he hadnt longed enough btc yet
339903,will be back soon dont worry
339905,does anyone have a good template to track crypto holdings on google sheets
339906,cryptosheetscom try this thing sir
339908,this is extremely unlikely russia has been trying to pass a crypto bill for several years now and all of them were just defining fines for all types of transactions leaving no room for legitimate use
339909,yep already deleted
339911,good guy ychad inviting inverse to the first round of bribes
339912,ok care to share me a url or two feel free to dm thanks
339913,sorry not sure what you are looking to buy check travala for travel bitrefill for gc
339914,im looking for examples
339915,travala is a good one
339916,i usually just send usdc from avax to cryptocom or ftx debit card and pay that way ill keep an eye out for when i see them again
339919,this is good thank you
339920,seems the big boys build their own inhouse but binance has something called binance pay that looks promising
339922,any recommends for cryptofriendly corporatebusiness banking for uk companies not taking outside funds no licence required
339923,as far as i know only guernsey banks are somewhat friendly
339924,silvergate bank frick fidor fidor works with krakeneuro sepa silvergate even works with us bank frick is leichsteitein based and friendly but its really comes to the amount you want to deal with so other options might be there if there is a good money involved im certain its worth to pay someone for the help
339925,some others include but not sure if good for corporate are flowbank signature bank and swissquote
339927,dont bother with the first two unless you are starting with 2m
339928,well thats why i mentioned it all comes to aum
339929,thanks guys appreciate the help already in touch with a few here but compliance is pretty slow didnt know fidor served uk so will check it out too
339930,its not 100 that they serve exactly uk but they serve all eu and others too for specific country obviously you need to verify this information yourself its more like a general crypto friendly banks i studied this topic recently there is a good forum where such info can be foud but i cant shill it i suppose
339931,why do some pools on convex stop streaming rewards
339933,doing testnet maybe we will have keet token airdrop
339936,does anyone know where to look for the floordao bonding discount stats
339937,
339938,scroll down to the bottom
339939,thank u ser
339940,oi
339941,tornado cash sanctions list is for the frontend of the dapp

339949,i cant answer such details not my line of biz but id recommend these guys theyre very thorough and professional flagtheorycomcompany formation incorporationsioeconomic citizenship passportsioimmigration residenciesio
339950,
339951,could somebody explain for me this
339952,this means that only need 1 gauge for 1 pool on multichain
339953,very high fees geared towards larger sized product clients iirc
339954,
339955,missing samurais katana
339956,nan
339957,well at least it works
339958,cowswap price action
339960,nice thats like the definition of composability in crypto
339961,if every avalanche subnet validator must validate the main chains too where is the scaling coming from
339962,scaling comes from there being only a small amount of validators for the specific subnet and so performance should be pretty high as subnets will be very centralised
339963,so all subnet validators must also validate the avax chain but not all avax validators will validate a given subnet
339964,that few validators itll be interesting to see the outcome of that
339965,cant find anything about it so uh are validator stakes on the main chain affected by activity on a subnet would random subnet t1000 with the validators colluding to insert whatever be penalized on the main chain
339966,malicious subnet validators arent currently penalized on the main net
339968,wow dumb trade you can mint steth 1 to 1
339969,what if he likes curve too much and want to swap it that way anyway
339971,hey im not complaining i get to buy more crv through ucrv
339972,that steth pool is popular seeing several 10 mil trades in there breddy goot
339973,i like curve too but wont swap there when the slippage is worse thats a ngmi strategy
339974,at his size he is already gmi for generations
339976,bcb
339977,you can add cross river bank and metropolitan bank as well for usa
339978,hey everyone weve had a vulnerability disclosure no funds at risk but here is the full rundown
339979,bcb will take months and months and screw you around as they hire people from trad banks who dont really get crypto their accounts guy is ex military and has no idea about startups he rejected a 100m hedge fund client because they emailed him from a gmail it was the fund managing partners personal gmail
339980,anybody familiar with these auditors
339981,nope sounds like they are all brand new
339982,i dont know much about subnets on avalanche but have to say cosmos shared security model sounds superior from a securitydecentralization aspect will be interesting when that launches
339983,could a subnets validator set collude and produce an invalide state
339984,dedaub found the multichain exploit code4rena isnt really an auditor read the description in the screenshot
339985,
339986,the above is an old post in response to gavin woods criticism of subnet security model but according to the threadsubnets are a subset of the larger universe of validators a subnets security is independent of the larger network so i would think yes to answer your question but having trouble finding more information the avalanche docs dont go into security implications or risks
339987,finding one exploit doesnt say much about the company as auditors its about consistency is that researcher who found the exploit the same guy working on the day to day auditsa good hunter is not always a good chef
339988,youre right though in their case its not one exploit it is their most significant or really cryptos most significant case though they arent so much new as they are without marketing clout
339989,guess that definitively answers their docs recommend 5 validators for a subnet going up to 10 methinks that isnt going to end well
339990,dedaub however has a great reputation
339991,they get work from the ethereum foundation
339992,that they do
339993,they also publish academic white papers
339994,which imho says more than a list of audits tbh
339995,i have seen three sigma labs work they are good as well but more niche
339996,ethereum foundation should be renamed the fiat foundationwhy did they sell so much eth for fiatsurely they can pay their bills in eth at least isnt promoting this kind of adoption one of their legal goals
339997,contractlibrarycom
339998,pretty sure winding down operations eventually is one of the goals too
339999,dunno 99 of the world wants dollars not eth
340000,yeah but ethereum foundation is not 99 of the world
340001,they have expenses i assume
340002,no shit sherlock
340003,thanks for your genius take
340004,and if they hold the eth it is centralized
340005,thanks i will wait for someone who actually knows what they are talking about
340006,dumb take them selling for fiat in 2018 is what saved them
340007,no et herium otherwise
340008,just sell the amount you need when the expenses arise do you know how much fiat they bought this last year
340009,no but generally they time the top perfectly so use it to your advantage
340010,time as in they literally move the market
340011,theyve sold over 55000 eth for fiat
340012,in the last 12 months
340013,theres nothing that costs that much
340014,it signals a lack of faith in using eth as a payment option
340015,and the fact is crypto payments are available for almost every good or service thats necessary for a ngo
340016,nonprofit
340017,how about a hypothetical if someone set up a real ethereum foundation and it only took fiat btc donations and used them to buy eth and then refused to use service providers that did not accept eth thus buying and using eth for millions of dollars worth of ecosystem payments both inside and outside the crypto worldwould this foundation be more benefit to ethereum than the ethereum foundationaka the professional fiat acquirers
340018,its kinda obvious no who needs volatile asset as a mean of payment
340019,you can liquidate it into anything you want upon receipt
340020,all assets and currencies have volatility
340021,that comment comes across as if you have never paid for anything in crypto before
340022,a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
340023,one eth now is worth two eth later
340024,today eth is 3000 but tomorrow it can be 70 ez
340025,fiat maxi
340026,ngmi
340027,only up ser
340028,its called nonprofit because its not meant to make a profit
340029,u can sell less eth for moar dollars moar good things u can do for less eth
340030,did you also not realize you can buy and sell things and services for eth
340031,i think its kinda smart move to sell high
340032,someone impersonate the moonbirds twitter account and their website actually transfers your nft to an address
340033,you do not need fiat in between
340034,
340036,nan
340037,this isnt an nft chat group
340038,tell this those guys who fixed their prices in eth while twas 1400 and then dropped to 70 totally rekt
340039,sry mate your salary just dropped 20 times
340040,so we cannt talk about anything about nft even thought some lobsters may be scammed
340041,i can tell vic you are a complete noobwelcome to cryptocurrenies they are a fully designed payment systemgood luck with your bags i hope the hard work that people have put on to making this ecosystem grow helps your bags somewhat
340042,is it a group hearing your words and react with love
340043,thats a misconception though the name doesnt help you have a point though if they did what you said they probably end up with more adoption but convenience wins again
340044,great that the real purchasing power of whatever usd that was gathered last year has fallen by 940 depending on which inflation index you use
340045,dont worry bout my bags ser
340046,i realize now why i stopped participating in public groups
340047,40 is still better than 20 times drop in a year
340048,u forgot 2018 okay its np ser
340049,muh ecosystem muh payments
340050,your telegram account was made less than a year ago
340052,i too find it strange that ethereum foundation would dump eth if they needed to reduce risk of treasury could have always hedged some using derivatives probably would have been the better move and made more sense
340053,
340054,trading derivs is not an option due to legal consequences they might cause
340055,its foundation not some individual shitcoin slinger
340056,then it should give out its grants in eth
340057,yeah no doubt some stuff is weird from them like transferring those 9 figures stack straight to exchange but i think its really simple its about sending a message
340058,every single time they did send to exchange it signaled the top several days so yeah clear message for newcomers
340059,maybe its a self fulfilling prophecy because the market believes eth foundation selling is the top
340060,not sure why using options futures to hedge risk should introduce any legal complications that simply selling on spot market would not it is common practice by all sorts of organizations do you have any source for this or is this just an assumption the fact that you liken using derivatives to shitcoin slinging makes me think the latter
340061,if even the eth foundation doesnt want its eth and cant find use for it then why should ireasoning
340062,well in many jurisdictions trading derivs requires special license its not an assumption how is it common practice by software development organization
340063,the assumption is that they eth foundation is under that jurisdiction perhaps yes not that its actually important people can fit narrative into whatever they want or see viable looking for some secret meaning into why eth foundation dumps their coins is like still looking for who satoshi really is
340064,just one kind of large software development company that uses derivatives as a hedge as an example for you ill leave this discussion here because you clearly have no clue what you are talking about
340065,fair
340066,its still requires special license to do that
340067,you dont need a special licence to trade derivatives as an organisation at least not in the usa
340068,first do you think it would be fairer if there was a set schedule by which the eth foundation built up its fiat reserve regardless of price action instead of selling sporadically second do you think the eth foundation should always be regarded as an authoritative figure in the ethereum ecosystem forever
340069,any broker will easily allow you to do it as easy as buying regular equity though if you want something quite sophisticated you may need a counterpart to take the other side buts its never been a question of licensing
340070,
340073,wow these scammers have scored two moonbirds and an azuki i get tagged by these daily they seem to have a large stock of verified accountsthis address accumulates the eth they make from liquidating stolen jpegs
340075,its not a defi treasury but the same principles apply
340076,selling when they think eth is high just seems like good treasury management
340077,for a hedge fund not for a charity whose entire purpose is to promote eth
340078,the thing that will get eth to widespread adoption is having resources to pay good devs and other people
340079,not insisting on paying every vendor employee and so forth in eth even at the size of the eth foundation the impact of that is probably ultimately negligible
340080,if its an emergency you can just sell a small amount when the need arises
340081,
340082,same principle applies to ef and eth
340083,a hundred million dollars
340084,i mean if they are consistently selling near the top thats just really good money management imo
340085,i want them to have as much runway as possible until eth development is finished
340089,hey was wondering where do you usually go to trade tokens otc is there private groups or airswap is still smth
340090,grapefruit
340091,wintermute just launched an otc platform you could check it
340092,
340095,is their a way to know how many lobster holder are floordao holder too please
340096,aeto80
340097,
340098,
340099,
340100,
340103,never heard of bean though
340104,its a stablecoin thing that was decently popular for like a week a while ago
340105,then it survived for like forever
340106,honestly respect for the team for keeping it up for so long
340107,a guy on tweet explained to me bean uses it stablecoin as governanceflash loan borrow enough to control governance pass and commit their own malicious contract rug
340109,nan
340110,wait so they actually donated to ukraine
340112,so even if you were to buy the dip they control gov and price can never recover
340113,is the bean thing even that sophisticated
340114,at this point which other protocols can be flash loaned gov proposal passed drained
340115,i didnt even know some protocols allowed instantaneous onchain proposals to pass not even a delay or something
340116,this is an excellent and horrifying question
340117,yeah how did it even get approved without any thought about it
340118,it seems like a poor mechanism
340119,its been a while since ive made any proposals but i thought there was a wider window minimum
340120,
340121,yep
340122,post mortem on this one oughtta be interesting hope yall were safe from it
340123,
340125,i had my life savings in bean
340126,sorry to hear that ive a couple frens deeply effected by this so far
340127,they do otc deals only
340128,eg mark cuban bought eth from them that way
340129,yearn has no time delay
340130,it is r a r e
340131,feel your pain i dont even want to say how much
340132,i didnt but lost quite a lot also
340133,very sad
340134,btw the bean dao contracts were audited
340135,wtf is omniscia though
340136,post audit conclusion the codebase of the beanstalk team can be considered of a very high standard and no outstanding issues remain within the codebase
340137,
340138,its amazing an audit of dao contracts didnt flag that you could acquire enough voting power propose vote and execute all in one txn usually you can only propose using power gained in a prior block then theres a proposal delay then theres a voting period and finally a timelock to actually execute
340139,i was researching it yesterday for parking 6fig in some yield farm god bless lobsters chat i searched bean here and many people warned to stay away from it so i did dodged a bullet
340140,allegedly the old harmony wallet is getting hacked i have no idea if its true but its also no longer being supported i would uninstall if you still have it asap
340143,yeah lots of recommendations in ct for bean as a great place to park some funds
340144,got me aswell kept my alloc smaller as it was a higher risk protocol to me
340145,sorry to hear that buddy hang in there maybe take a break for a bit
340146,guys im joking
340147,but really sorry to those affected
340148,distasteful joke sir
340149,yearn doesnt have automatic onchain governance
340150,dude this is not funny
340151,tried to distill some thoughts about what future funds might look like feedback welcome
340152,
340153,it was basis with a twist but this exploit had nothing to do with that
340155,closer to esd than basis i think
340156,bean exploited is a sad story but attacking people who wrote info thread about new defi protocol is not a good idea
340157,basis is in crypto time a decade older than esd
340158,if people keeps doing that nobody dares to share new defi pj
340159,noone forces them to ape and get rekt
340160,theyre all based off the same whitepaper with largely insignificant tweaks they never bother to read their frontpage though basisio
340161,usually would agree but shilling an old fralwed design multiple times indicated as such especially when it starts with might break stablecoins like tether and ust
340162,lol slap one or two vc logos on the front page and it goes from anon farm to serious project
340163,eh true i shouldnt have used that word lemme edit done
340164,i know a guy who literally did crazy stuff
340165,invite him in lobsters so he can search the history quickly i mean if you are technically pleb like me you should use others people opinion who are more technical and has skin in the game
340166,gj
340167,olympusdao cofounder just got doxxed by lawsuit
340169,how do you know
340170,
340171,oh well
340172,dude used his real name andor a phone number associated with his real identity
340173,bad opsec and no counterosint methods been used twittercomofficer_ciastatus1444456564551819270these techniques might have saved him
340174,
340175,whats the most common way to bridge eth sol
340176,portalbridge
340177,wormhole
340178,first time i saw them was the initial olympus dao audit
340180,tmelobsters_chat338943
340181,ahemdoesnt this highlight the very function used for the exploit but say nothing about it
340182,ftx if you dont mind kyc
340183,
340184,
340185,lmao
340186,greg is from nethermind right
340187,told you
340188,wow soothsayer
340189,that had zilch to do with the exploit though
340190,the point hes making is that it was an unserious concept to begin with
340191,it was plenty serious all they did was tweak this basisio
340192,look at the big names on there if it had a nice face and a couple of articles from you know who half this chat would probably be in it
340193,people investing in bean reminds me of that guy on biz that invested in bingus token i just cant help but laugh and thats before the exploit
340194,if it kept going this probably would have happened lol
340195,wait for the next algostable hype farm to be up and the capital will shift
340196,yeah it had nothing to do with the exploit but there were many other reasons why should it fail i was actually surprised that guys like jack niewold were posting bullish stuff about beans and i thought it was really irresponsible of him them getting exploited was just a shortcut to the final model algo stable that is stable at 0
340197,meh rather people experiment with a proper algo stable than 500 iterations of fiatcoins and fiatcoin wrappers
340199,how do you fund sol into a new wallet anon so you can even use portal bridge
340200,as a foreword we would like to state that the code exploited in the attack has not been audited by omniscia as it was introduced beyond our initial audits of the system
340201,isnt that the exact code in their audit here
340202,as a final contributing factor the governance module contains an emergencycommit function that allows the caller to circumvent the usual lifecycle of a proposal and immediately execute it should they have supermajority voting powerthat function is highlighted right there in the audit
340203,i couldnt check the code for myself yet traveling i did see a bunch of commits postaudit that seemed to touch on core features but then again im very unfamiliar with the protocol
340205,anyone know of tools to analyze lp positions kinda like seedlefinance revertfinance but one that supports other chains specifically pancakeswap
340206,maybe a good toolsresources github repo
340207,checked the daily ape and didnt find anything
340208,you have apy vision too who works multichain but i think you must pay to check other chains than eth
340209,yeah saw that they want 50 usdc for a one time use might just splurge thanks bro
340210,just found this as well for bsc they want 05 of your portfolio in their token
340211,try defiwatch its free
340212,if anyone is looking for a ticket fir eth day tomorrow my tickets for eth day the best of devconeeeeeeect on monday april 18 2022 1000 am in transformatorhuis amsterdam are for sale at guts
340213,see here sir and in comments tmeofficer_cia82
340214,or here sovsnotionsiteportfolio141788f1791b4612a8ebfd69a3750a62
340215,whats the best tokenomic youve seen recently
340216,hex
340217,is there a way to load a contract from etherscan into remix
340218,not sure but there is this
340219,oh i was looking for something like that just the other day thanks
340220,unless you copy and paste you have to use the etherscan api to directly access the source
340221,
340222,you can btw use inport url
340223,eg import httpscomcontractsol
340225,any reliable provider of eth implied volatility via oracle or at least api
340226,and t3 index
340227,is it safe security option to just buy build in vpn in braveor i should setup my once server once and for alldoing defi for security reasons
340228,we talked about vpn last year l dont belive they are secure as long as you dont use stable ip you are secured enough
340229,and we had a chat about routers too
340230,you would be better off using mullvad directly than whatever it is brave is reselling
340231,mullvadnetis that correctasking because so many mentions here but only 14k followers in twitter
340232,yup thats mullvad
340233,nan
340235,spam
340236,how do u do the spoiler thing omg
340237,
340238,nan
340239,please explain
340240,serious question here im working with a huge company whos building out a blockchain project its actually a sick project and they have the resources to make it work theyve asked me to contact ventures and angels for funding but its seeming impossible to reach them through a cold email whats the best route accelerators and incubators cold calls reaching to ceos on telegram cus emails forsure are not the way
340241,twitter
340242,announce on twitter they will show up
340243,web3enabled mobile app eth walletstogether lets make a full list of legitimate onesegmetamask pillar mew tallyany others that come to mind
340244,bunch of them eg
340245,ping joel_john95 on twitter he might help
340246,missing walleth maybe not a real contender until they support eip 1559 oh and status
340247,didnt read it thoroughly so thanks for pointing it out
340248,yes you need to hold their token in lp pools but frankly thats very little 1k of pool for 500k of viewed assets
340249,the tool is really worth it
340250,it doesnt track the next generation amm like solidly and its iterations though
340251,just the old school pools
340252,this didnt have pillar which is one of the longest running eth wallets
340255,the bean guys doxxed themselfs
340256,nan
340257,reporting to fbi for running ponzu
340258,useless imo but still fair play
340259,
340260,but instead driven by trust not trustlessnessis this written by the same guy who is hailed as the godfather of defi
340261,google their names
340262,one may be a goldman sachs software security analyst
340263,sanderson
340265,makes 2b tvl project nonupgradable with bugs crypto is deaddude if only he looked at solidly and said i can do this better
340266,lmao
340267,the crypto ethos is still there i just feel that as a very public dev it was hard for him to hear it over the banshee shrieks of the crypto cultured but what he now seems excited about sounds well and truly disconnected from the crypto ethos that once drove him thats how it comes across anyway a lot of resentment there but its no surprise
340268,the last 2 paragraphs oof onchain fintech full steam ahead
340269,regulator time
340270,building cbdcs sounds wonderful
340271,earned a lot of money with experiment in badlands after that rage quit let users cried and now writing a blog post want a regulated crypto culture
340272,could somebody tell me in tradfi what will happen with a dev when rage quit and let users cried
340273,came ot check if someone here wrote this yet
340274,in tradfi you dont cry about the dev on telegram
340275,you certainly dont get permission to put money into random contracts 3las ensure youre rich enough to be considered smart enough to be able to tell the difference between a scam and a legit project
340276,no test in prod
340277,pretty sure that happened when longing was disabled on rh and other brokers for shitquities like gamestop
340278,so if the idea is tradfi suddenly gives you the benefits without the personal responsibility well theres a reason crypto is a thing in the first place
340279,ape culture is at fault for some its a reason to be proud of putting money in something without thinking its even better if friends join so we get that group encouragement
340280,for me its the airdrop hunters ruined discord big time
340281,muh culture is at fault
340282,nan
340283,new projects have to stay stealth longer
340284,and ive had more than one founder tell me vcs are actually most active governance participants
340285,well they certainly cried but to which dev 9 times out of 10 youre never gonna find yourself in the same chat with dev
340286,crying to the masters same shit
340287,yes afaik wintermute has a specific role for it it called defi envoy
340288,yeh ive noticed funds actively hiring gov specialists
340289,kinda redundant discussion tbh
340290,anyone familar with bancor that i could bug with a question
340291,about not to the difference is hardly trivialyou go through customer support and you hope its not an ai that picks up the message then you get a ticket and eventually maybe you get an answer dev bangs out code and goes home
340292,its not rocket science thatmarket participants would partake in asset governance discussions
340293,i didnt read the op properly
340294,
340295,the only stakeholders actually incentivized to think long term
340296,something tells me we have gone from founders market to investors market
340297,winter protection is coming
340298,what a drama queen thought he was calling it quits guess he couldnt muster the lack of attention and just had to post this
340299,my 002 crypto is not dead like all technologies its going from a fanatic minority to a rapidly growing majority dont take my word for it consider the ceos that were celebrated in 20152017 protocol founders l1 experts vs 2020 sam at ftx as a technology matures attention rapidly accumulates around what appeals to the most after a year of literal shitcoin farming and monkeyface jpeging the markets are tired of microponzies vcs have reduced aping into the 20th defi venture doing the same thing and markets are realising most of dao tooling is saas ventures with spacetech valuations theres also massive massive competition earlier it was just developers at the fringes interested now theres folks that shipped shit to scale from web2 building stuff with capital in abudnance and many of them are not chasing valuations most common route for raises has gone from omg send wallet for saft to smh well tokenise when theres traction heres a safe obviously these changes may look like market is dying but it isnt its maturing nfts as a product category is seeping into musicart theres more traditional well established fintech folks seeing how they can use defi as rails and btc lying flat at 40k after the gargantuan falls its historiclaly had 12k 20k is impressive on its own the industry is maturing and the nature of celebrities apps we care about will evolve with it thats all
340300,very nicely written great intern
340301,maybe governance token was a mistake
340302,i think this industry is sneed
340303,great write up id add that i think the current run up is the equivalent of the 19982000 dot com internet run up 201718 being the equivalent of 1995 and netscape ipo for the internet we still dont have the web3 native equivalents of facebook and twitter
340304,ok enough blabla thank u gm
340306,its actually kinda reassuring knowing the convo will end
340307,gud ux
340308,so defi product wise have we gone from regulation by team regulation by people dao regulation by code immutable regulation by governmentor have i missed a step near the end
340309,hey im looking for teammates for the chainlink hackathon
340310,i want to build a defi product
340311,regulation by luck if you count all the security breaches lately
340312,implemented gip6 gip7 1 pool limits tvl x2 you can now lp more2 borrow limits up to 500000 per credit account3 added crv ldo luna sushi ftmthe dapp has been updated many bugs were fixed walletconnect now works tootry it
340313,nan
340314,nan
340315,nan
340316,what can be done with ldo steth weth leverage thingy
340317,not yet just the governance token stethweth will come with v2
340318,thats for v2 very soon youll be able to 10x steth staking yields instead of what everyone now is doing just with x3
340319,will there be liquidation prevention technic everyone doing x3 and im too chicken for steth to get unpegged somehow and get rekt
340320,tbh yes as soon as nikolajankovic stops ignoring me jk for stetheth borrowing you would likely not even face liquidations i dont have the historic data maybe amantay_a apeir99n have but that peg hasnt really deviated much ever so an 8x is likely the same as borrowing stable to stable
340321,max deviation was around 095 eth per steth as i recently read somewhere
340322,dmitry this thread from another nikola covers risks of these leveraged stetheth positions pretty well the tldr is that the largest steth depeg happened in march 2021 while a huge curve disbalance happened in september 2021
340323,the part on the fees for this position in different options is somewhat wrong or not detailed enough so double check that before jumping in
340324,they have to be now its an actively asked value offer
340325,can devs work harder need take leverage to pay taxes
340326,chainlink oracle for stetheth ticker was deployed in aug 2021 since then the max deviation happened is 098
340327,nice claimed my gear token today so now i just need to check to who to delegate them too
340328,ethers js
340329,its a wallet ppl forget thhat
340330,
340331,so if i understand this we can take a leveraged lp position by adding eth borrowing one of these tokens and then depositing in the lp is there anything im missing here
340332,the v1 is quite limited but still fun to play around and can be quite useful for things like borrow wbtc x4 and sell to usdc within the credit account implies a short and then throw this into yearn yvusdc soon many more pools convex use any of the alts in the allowedlist to boost your health factor portfolio margining and then borrow more of the asset your credit account is denominated in smth else idk
340333,so then all of those interactions go through the credit account so as you all add more integrations this will be pretty cool
340334,thats the idea growing composability for example here is something about v2 soon
340335,and the credit account interest rate is based on the pool utilization
340336,yes the model on apy is similar to the one with aave
340337,ok perfect thanks
340338,frens whats the best place to trade perpetuals on polygon
340340,gains network
340341,this is probably not what ac had in mind but personal trust could actually be a strong element in decentralization the amount of people i can personally trust is naturally limited which makes it theoretically stronger anchor than economic incentives securing a blockchain if i would set up a group of trusted people to exchange with then we could define our own no regulation and be truly independent that is called a local economic trading system lets and there are hundreds of attempts spanning back many decades those aim for selfsufficiency which comes at the cost of economic efficiency in global markets updating the model to web3 would mean that the groups would not have to aim for selfsufficiency i could be in multiple groups where only a limited set of goods is traded within a group the trust is strong it is reduced when moving to between group trade or global trade all can work in parallel such system of overlapping lets groups would enable people to pick the degree of decentralization and type of regulation that they want
340342,trustlines sort of stuff
340343,encointer and such
340344,i am not aware what these are will check out thanks
340345,trustlinesapp lets you establish a debt with connections who can then through their trustlines with you establish connections with your lines etc i added a favor currency to that a while back so if you and i open a channel of 1 favor each this means i owe you one and you owe me one but then if you open another channel of 11 with someone else you now have 2 favors to give but also owe two one in each direction technically i can now ask a favor of your connection through you
340346,this one is a common good chain in polkadot which relies on inperson meetings for proof of personhood to me these schemes are kinda doa but good to see experimentation kind of like a live idena
340347,this sounds close to what i had in mind traditional lets has balance 0 for all group members at start buying puts you on minus which is a commitment to sell something for some group member prices are freely negotiated and trade is voluntary scaling that up needs some rooting to the personal trust to keep the system decentralized and groups independent otherwise it will just return to being a global economy where others have bigger say in deciding rules of my economic interactions

340352,it was working like ass now is fine
340353,was there any discussion about matic token redesign from messari article interestingly the token will not be mandatory for all users meaning it will not be necessary to buy stake or hold for many users it may just be something in the background looking at the polygon roadmap it seems the main focus is on zk rollups so im wondering where the pos chain token fits in
340354,i assumed as much but any details from the devswe had a bunch of issues with walletconnect at ambire
340355,wanna see if your experience is similar
340356,what is a way to swap native btc to usdt trc20 on iphonei hear about thorchain but there is no iphone app
340357,oxmikko can share when he is back
340358,ef has open source accounting see page 20 onwards in their 2022 report pointers they are sitting on a tonne of eth 160m usd worth of eth is just 10 of their stack the treasury split is 80 eth 20 fiatthey need to have a good amount of fiat in case of a multi year market downturn the devs themselves prefer being paid in fiat and not eth
340359,honestly id rather that the ef dumps more of their eth they currently hold about 02 of all eth no one entity should have that much
340360,45 of eth supply was in ico wallets in 2018 02 is ntohing to worry about
340361,ico wallets means thousands of different individuals not a single entity though
340362,no ico wallets mean firms that did icos ef has consistently managed to sell the top on eth rallies this will play out just fine
340363,everyday i am constantly impressed and more confused by crypto defi moves lol
340364,heres a rare image of how defi works from time to time this should explain most things in life too
340365,i think in current example he moved up 1 plug
340366,nan
340367,they used to have way morefortunately for supply decentralization their terrible money management and their inability to ship pos for years made their war chest thinnerimagine them staking 510 of all supply
340368,is this an emissionbased token
340369,ef does not run any validators the geth team does but as part of the client incentive program along with all other client teams
340370,whats this sticker
340371,ivangbi
340372,eh whatever 0xb1 promotes is sketchy

340440,hi everyone
340441,how are you guys doing wanted to stop by and introduce myself im a foreign attorney and crypto tax analyst specializing in reconciliations
340442,welcome we all live in dubai though
340443,hahaha love it
340444,i still do reco work
340445,how much is andres net worth billions
340447,thats what those spam messages were all about
340449,so does everybody think andre is a sellout now that he is pro crypto regulation what is the consensus
340450,the consensus is to think for yourself
340451,i certainly am disappointed by his actions comes off as immature motivated by spite and bitterness rather than intellect and discerning judgment resentment kills creativity which is a damn shame
340452,it reads like the neighborhood karen ranting about being kicked out of the hoa for screaming about the acceptable frequency of lawn ornaments
340453,this misses the mark andre has been pretty consistent in his belief and he is right that the average crypto participant is motivated by nothing more than greed and is detrimental to the space advocating for regulation seems like a natural progression for him imo
340454,well he was talking a lot in that podcast with supermassiveone that he saw defi going from dudes in suits to dudes in hoodies and hes right we arent making the world a better place tm were just transferring wealth from one set of people to another this group is smaller more urban and will do nothing but to increase the divides already ruining our societies admittedly he could have worded it a little better and not have exited with 10figs what were all trying to do or maybe that just makes him better at pointing it out than any of us
340455,hes a sellout
340456,hes just getting ahead of the regulators coming for him
340457,his legal counsel probably told him to write something like that
340458,didnt andre help start this group
340459,all fiscal systems are the products of human greed crypto will be corrupted by it but it buys us more timein the meantime it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for innovation in finance lots of people have lost money but lots of people are also making far higher returns than would have ever been normally possible prior to defi expecting a perfect system and abandoning your work when its just as flawed as you are is sad we cannot hope for perfect only better
340460,its just ppl railing into him because its trendy 18k members later and you cant deny that the chats sometimes are no way near as good as the start
340461,i would say we should design and build the system to help mitigate the effects of human greed on cooperative systems but that might make me weird also agree we should workhope for better
340462,i looked up to the man and im sad to see him acting this way
340463,i mean i was bitching about a lot of defi on eth being built on small multisigs since summer 2020 so like
340464,nah his writing is brilliant metamodernist trolling of cryptocommunity its like ai trained on ct answered the question write the article that will piss off the most peoplehis next move is going to be a release of some insane cryptoanarchist project that will be complete opposite of bullshit he wrote
340465,that would be great but im pretty sure hes gone full boomer
340466,i dont think hes really this stupid hes probably in an alt giggling and this very convo or something hes clearly keeping his eye on whats going on yeah i think its a setup for something else he stumbled with solidly yes but idle hands are the devils work
340467,hes clutching his pearls in his oversized yacht hoping the plebs dont try and take it from him
340468,this has always been the take on andre occams razor is that he wanted to get the money and run the whole time now he feels bad and is trying to pull the bridge up behind himcover his ass
340469,id say the best you can hope for is to delay your progeny from screwing it all up for a while look at america worked for a while running into issues same with rometrick is to keep building
340470,end of the day the ethos that he goes on about comes down to freedom and individual responsibility very much a part of true freedom so he is going against the ethos that he claims to value calling for regulation to protec is all about protecting himself the post was not needed he already stated he was leaving and i agree that it stunk of resentment bitterness and entitlement
340471,well said
340474,no not even close lmfao
340475,way
340476,no
340477,this is good take much agreed
340478,he realizes fantom cant compete without an edge that edge is being the kyc chain
340479,all human systems only last so long
340480,thats not an edge
340481,i mean it can be reproduced anywhere without any difficulty

340509,best governance no governance immutable contractruns away
340510,having purely immutable contracts would kill 95 of defi this would include almost all lending protocols and by extension any protocols that depend on them as a base layer perhaps people would be fine with that but is that really what people want an extremely rigid capital inefficient financial system i suspect they dont shouts into the void as artem runs off with fingers in his ears
340511,isnt it suboptimal to dump the whole fpis stack in one transaction
340513,i agree with this but this is really great for apps which have matured and there are hardly any of them one example i like to quote is disperseapp which works nicely without a token
340514,gnosis safe worked well without a token but people have to get paid
340515,a small markup would be a better strategy than these token launches which suck money from retail for insidersdevs a model like charge 011 ethyear to create a gnosis safe might be nice top it up with some premium support etc
340516,governance tokens are just a way to get around regulation for teams real decisions are not made by governance mostly anyways
340517,not sure theres anything noteworthy about it tbh just another ct shillerinfluencer being discovered as a blatant pnder
340518,anyone know any nonevm chain that have integration to metamask
340519,hi lobsters i would like to share my new article in this article i am discussing the competitive advantage of governance tokens feel free to reach me in dm or comments if interested also i can implement the new vision for your stable coin project
340520,chain should support evm spec to be integrated with meatamask so it is rarely possible or requires creation of an additional middle layer
340521,i dont think metamask have plans to do this nor it makes sense to use try to port the existing metamask codebase to use non evm chains check out the clover wallet as good non evm option what i enjoy about them is that they multi plex connections which means you can easily naviagte between chains on different tabs without having to reset your network manually
340522,liquality also do multi chain wallets with atomic transactions
340523,well im a beam fan and they just made such integration beam is its own non evm chain
340524,
340525,its has a middle service but when you think of this its very similar to infura
340526,thanks ill check
340527,this is non trival ive tried before and gave up kudos to the devs
340529,yes that is what i mean by middle layer thank you for sharing
340530,if by nonevm you include has an evm compatibility layer but not actual evm underneath then moonbeam and acala have
340532,along with near that has aurora or cardano that milkomedia and many others
340533,is ethereum killed yet asking for a friend
340534,evmos soon
340535,neon on solana too
340536,very cool was not aware of neon aurora milkomedia moonbeam acalaintegration to metamaskthe main difference i spot right away is that on beam all tx are private by default which is very cool to have metamask sign private tx
340537,zkmoney is a private by default l2 based off zk works with metamask just signing transactions
340538,fyi had to use metamask for something recently and still garbage much prefer framesh or even rabby has gotten better
340539,metamask snaps could be interesting tho
340540,dont feel bad metamask in its current implemtation wont work past january 2024
340541,browser extenstion for web3 is terrible ux
340542,yeah aware but not the same as this is an l2 on eth so the challenge to integrate to metamask almost not exists
340543,i could see a metamask snap for zkmoney very easy similar to them having the swap feature just deposit to l2 button doubt they will do that as it looks like they promoting privacy but with snaps anyone can download the plugin off github import as snap and privacy restored metamask can plead they dont have control on what people load in as snap or not or at least for awhile
340544,they vision of modular snaps never took off so there isnt a just when it comes to metamask you would find yourself having to implement so many helper libraries that you might as well rebuild it also metamask is tightly coupled to how the evm is works i remember things like the block tracker and nonce tracker doing my head in
340545,thanks but could you explain why it isnt work one of the issue we had when i was still at brave was privacy and security which is why they moved they wallet into browsers core and not an extension anymore
340546,can you change the rpc on frame because on rabby you cant
340547,ah the metamask dev i chatted with made it sound way easier
340548,yes and have many fail overs
340550,seems like hes awaken
340551,any live streaming from amsterdam
340552,
340553,3 letter agents got him this could not be any further any from test in prod
340554,token issuance licenseyeah so many controversial feelings about that
340555,this crossed my mind initially when he and anton left glad im not the only one
340558,not if you want to bring fixed forex on chain and volume from people without them being scared of regulations
340560,yeh im djing a set
340561,socifi social daos political daos and projects taking into account all regulatory stuff and other political things which are going on web3 social networks also so all things which help coordination of the people
340562,also nftbased patents tokenization can be a blast
340563,that is too reliant on governments
340564,it is an ideal use case for blockchain
340565,lmao from a builder to villian in 3 months
340566,this is truly cursed behavior lol
340567,privacy is coming
340568,
340569,not much the same imo from blockworks l2sbridge data storagedaos and social tokensgamingderivatives undercollateralized lending
340570,they keep saying derivatives every quarter
340572,in means of understanding him i try to shift my mind to his perspective considering him unambiguously villain has to be a mistake hes a proficient developer and judging on his earlier papers he would rather code the f out of this world than solve ethical dilemmas maybe he is working rn on some kind of project which is related to cryptotogov cryptotobiz solutions and trying to solve problem how law understands that mappingaddress uint256 is moneywell the other option is that he is just trolling us
340573,i hope its this tbh
340574,he really likes trolling though
340575,well i was right building cbdcs
340576,bye andre dont let the door hit you on the way out
340577,i wonder if he will test in production while working on 3la projects
340578,sure upon first class action lawsuit
340580,hello friends in case you swingby amsterdam milan or anywhere in the metaverse over this spring here some nice opportunities to collaborate and build value together
340581,question here how is a wallet able to receive erc20 tokens without a transaction log for the receiptthis wallet holder was able to swap a spam token for eth but neither etherscan nor other block explorers show the initial token receipt
340582,are you skillwallet founder i was researching the project a couple of days ago and was curious about olympics lets chat
340584,is it because of the new hidden token feature
340585,sure you can dm me
340586,id initially thought so but i dont see it from my end neither on ethplorer
340587,is it possible to leave some words on chain when you interact with a contract for example buy eth with uniswap and leave a reason on chain
340588,sold an nft and noted i lost half this time
340589,what if reason is too shameful
340590,if its for tax purposes you can add private notes per transaction as a reminder to yourself and then use external services to taglabel the different transactions at the moment of declaring your taxes
340591,for recalling my historical tx and understand what i was thinking back then
340592,why waste money storing that onchain i expect most tax tools let you store a comment per transaction
340593,spend money for persistent storage your comments may become archaeological evidence
340594,dear etherscan dairytoday i saw the 3rd asuki lookalike this one has fishing rods i feel this is the one and they will definitely 100x this time afterall issac newton had 99 problems before he fixed the steam engine
340595,this will def be studied in the far future
340596,you can change a users erc20 balance in a smart contract and choose not to emit a transfer event
340597,yo amsterdam a few seafood dwellers are around nemo ivangbi were walking around devconnect venue today will also be here today and tomorrow to chat work and give out stickers next to that if you are a builder participating in eth global or have a friend who is participating chat to us gearbox we can help with tutorials docs and more we also have the highest tier prize structure can figure out together so youd qualify for a few crossnominations by different sponsors at a time shoot a message anywhere would love to chat help you with ideas

340658,manifest v3 wont have backgroundjs and will use service workers
340659,ah lol i know about the manifest change as it relates to extensions the comment made it sound like something else
340660,what are the pitfalls of service workers with storage apis
340661,as for the one implication
340662,the author of ublock on google chromes proposal to cripple ad blockersarticle comments
340663,great for googles ad business though
340664,great for brave too
340665,
340666,will push more people to look for alternatives
340667,depends brave uses chromium too
340668,brave implements ad block in the core code not as an extension i believe
340669,i used to work for brave and can attest to the amount of blood and tears that brave spends on removing all the anti privacy stuff from chromium
340670,so if brave ends up implementing the same change ublock is dead there too and while their integrated adblocker is good for mobile it is simply inferior to ublock
340671,yeah i can imagine
340672,
340673,is this not just simply biconomy providing gasless transactions on polygon by the appteam paying gasfees instead article from july 2020

340675,like coindix to find opportunities in defi

340698,interested in hearing peoples thoughts on this
340699,mmmmm
340700,i mean wormhole celer nomad anyswapmultichain have been been working on interchain messaging for a bit even chainlink announced ccip last year altho not sure where its at right nowlayerzerostargate and team do deserve huge credit on their success and recognition but the narrative and tech isnt exactly new happy to be corrected and curious about the perception and opinions
340701,cosmos also has ibc working
340702,
340703,which is better than the other ones
340704,hes a shitposter
340705,watching him get repeatedly ratioed by the wormhole team is statisfying
340708,dont forget multichain with anycallthe tech is different each of these protocols uses a different approach especially in terms of architecture each of us believes our approach is the bestwe at multichain believe a smpc nodes network is the best approachin the end maybe there is no fully correct answer but i dont think this infighting is the solution
340709,forgot mentioning anyswapmultichain
340710,router protocol too
340711,i think
340712,i think the challenge with this category is a lack of understanding around even things as basic as what constitues a bridge do we mean a liquidity network mintandburn token bridge or generalized message passing channel to cosmos ibcs credit the project has been focused on building underlying data channels since very early on with token transfers as just one specification for sending packets between zones however given the massive need for this in noncosmos chains yesterday were seeing a proliferation of high quality teams building out infra for evm and other environments but there are no standards and the language is all fragmented it makes it very hard for a nontechnical user to understand whats going on under the hood which allows for playing loose and fast with positioning
340713,ahaha wasnt saying this to make you mention all of the protocolswas just saying its not as simple
340714,indeed as pranaymohan rightly pointed out no standards different approaches and very significant tradeoffs which is hard to evaluate for retailnontechnical users that are easily swayed by narrative and positioning
340715,soon a new crosschain message aggregator will emerge which will do the heavy lifting for devs to select which bridge to use for sending messages i beleive the ibc standard will become the base standard as being implemented by layerzero others will also implement it socket already does a great job in aggregating liquidity bridge soon it might also do it for data bridging
340717,ooh yeah movr networksocket tech been working on this too its really cool that several big brain folks are really ultra passionate about different approaches speaking of aggeregators li fi aggregates all of em btw to my knowledge primarily asset transfer but soon data transfer tooo theres across protocol too each one awesome in their own lane
340719,
340721,is it fud or is it really possible
340722,aggregators taking positive slippage is a long know feature i doubt tho that user was quoted 35k in ui
340723,i have read the comments most likely 50 slippage
340724,ibc protocol does seem like the best tool for the job but its not trivial to implement outside of cosmos based chains however multiple parties working on implementations such as light clients
340725,xcm is pretty great too a few advantages it has over ibc is that it allows incentivised message passing and also ensures the message is executed correctly via spree i think xcm is a dark horse in this race that no one seems to be talking about
340726,another thread to look at
340727,
340728,llama stonk
340729,the beauty of decentralized systems is that anyone can make improvement proposals have them considered by the community as use cases evolve we will see new token standards being created with characteristics that solve for a larger ecosystemhere is an ultimate list of token standards for evm and nonevm chains
340731,doesnt matter what slippage they used its still stealing lol
340732,i had some slippage a couple of days back i fell down and broke a hip im on calcium tablets now
340733,data is onchainclick decode input data you will see that minreturnamount is 18138minreturnamount is the amount user was quoted slippage user specified so unless user is trading with 50 slippage settings on 1inch they were in fact quoted 18k yetikeeping everything over the quoted amount is standard for 1inch its how they monetize the service if you dont like it check out paraswap i believe they used to take only 50 of positive slippage not sure what their current approach is firebird doesnt collect any positive slippage but rather takes 005 service fee for the swap
340734,positive slippage is a big part of how aggregators earn revenue i am pretty sure paraswap does this too 0x i think does it but not sure
340735,pretty bad model
340736,there are ton of a ways for a trade to go bad on a user and they introduced another one
340737,or you could just use low slippage
340738,51
340739,you wont get in a hyped launch with low slippage
340740,why would you use 1inch to get in a hyped launch
340741,interact with router directly on etherscan for example
340742,it also allows you to put any slippage you want to
340743,well i dont personally but not everyone knows about other ways
340744,million dollar question
340745,wouldnt the same happen with that slippage though
340746,since the price is lower now more tokens returned 1inch just gives the user the min amount still less value
340747,you get the price quoted 05 1 if you have a problem with that dont use 1inch or look for aggregators that dont fund themselves this way whilst still honouring the price they quotei havent seen any new launches advising buyers to use an aggregator service you can search back to november last year when this was discussed maybe earlier too
340748,thats the point of using aggregators usually they just launch on one platform right y pay extra gass
340749,say no to freeloading
340750,sers do you know any good agencys for nft marketingpreferrable in one to one arts no pfps
340751,hey guys anyone can assist with ticket to maker event today
340752,good note thank you
340753,
340754,can you change from a zero to nonzero balance because technically thats what happened just never knew it was possible by design
340755,it was nonstandard token for sure
340756,btw the actual quoted amount that user accepted should be in the last input variable data havent checked but expect to see the 18156472549465644721290 number encoded in the data variable
340757,you can but it has to be coded in
340758,are macha and 1inch decentralized services or would they be considered centralized given its the individual companies operating the api and offchain aggregation
340759,lobster daily 387 daily recap 19 april1 lobsters in amsterdamlink to discussion if youre in amsterdam too hop on to chat hear 2 crypto regulation vs regulated crypto read link to discussion like to discussion 3 vitalik about onchain governance without minimum voting periods and snapshotslink link to discussion 4 anyone know any nonevm chain that have integration to metamasklink to discussion 5 how is it possible to receive erc20 tokens without a transaction log for the receipt link link to discussion
340761,definitely centralized you cant relly use their contracts without using their api
340762,they are noncustodial
340763,so apart from restricting access from iran and sanctioned countries centralized apirpc operators have no other known licensing obligations or rules to follow
340764,well they can create rules as they wishthat is the point of centralized systems
340765,no legal chat here they have to follow all relevant restrictions as do their users
340766,
340767,what does that imply probably u can guess
340768,airdrop is coming
340769,wow
340770,its news its relevant ser
340771,brb sybillin
340772,lol nice findwhy are we sybililin protocols are there any details on the airdrop structure
340773,having trouble understanding synthetix staking snx is staked by minting susd but snx is still tradable cant people sell their staked snx or am i understanding it wrongly
340774,you collateralize your susd minting with snx this locks the snx until you repayburn the susd to unstake if your snx goes up in value you can unstake some though as long as you maintain a 400 collateralisation ratio
340775,hmm whats preventing people from selling their snx is there a mechanism which prevents this from happening since it not staking in the traditional sense
340776,the snx are locked until you repay by burning susd you cant sell them
340777,injective has this
340778,whatever happened to them i remember they were all the rage back in the day
340779,still building i think some interesting launches likely coming soon
340780,fourth year of testnet
340781,shots fired
340783,instuction unclear does this mean their fork will be the canon solidly protocols isnt solidex maintaining solidly too
340784,would be a first to get an official hard fork from an ad hock team i think
340785,the contracts are immutable solidex is maintaining the ui to solidly but cant fix the bugs
340786,oops no there were pasta before lol
340787,the tweet reads they are redeploying the contract and copying the states in the new version
340788,people would have to migrate liquidity to new pools and yes sounds like some kind of snapshot and new token
340789,
340790,wonder who decides on the canon protocol in this situation will be interesting to see this being rolled out
340791,the usersliquidity is the only thing that matters in the end
340792,they are effectively launching a solidity fork with 11 airdrop to existing solid holders both unlocked and vetokens no such thing as canon imo is etc canon
340793,judging by chain activity i believe eth is the canon and etc is some kind of asymetric bet hardcore ethos
340794,but ye the situation would be similar to eth etc where some users prefer the fixed protocols vs others stick to the original
340795,canon is ultimately decided culturally right
340796,by layer zero consensus of how people feel so like eth is canon over etc but uniswap is definitely canon over sushi my best guess is people will see the existing solidly as noncanon because the creator is no longer working on it its got bugs its open source so it almost seems fair game and beneficial to reboot
340797,uni sushi is different tho as both team are active its a og vs fork story rather than a canon orphan story
340798,that said im rebootteam as well
340799,ultimately similar thought process i guess one is the real one and one is the fakecopyforknoncanon
340800,
340801,seems like element kicked off airdrop szn rd 2
340802,thats pretty cool
340803,awesome do you have access to come inside we are currntly in the first room on the left as you come in but i can come meet you at the front
340804,that was the xpollinate bridge right
340805,yes
340806,awesome i must ran so many wallets through that thing back when it had like only four chains
340807,hey everyone any suggestion on what antidetect i should use for multiple coinlist accounts
340808,for one probably not announcing it here
340809,why not taboo topic
340810,well not much point of a door if everyone already has the keys
340811,hi guys given the recent development of fudshill some opinion about ldo valuefirst article so take it easy on me
340812,thumbnail says how much lido can actually worth instead of what is the true valuation of lido or how much can lido actually be worth it just stuck out so i just thought id share my initial thoughts ser not trying to be anal
340813,done
340814,nan
340815,nice one ser
340816,what if they update tokenomic to a vemodel
340817,it would not seem to be the case but lets wait to see how the use of dao treasury will evolve
340818,pls no
340819,would honestly projects try some wacky new token models rather than everybody just going eh venomics is alright lets try that
340820,just because it works alright for curve doesnt mean itll work for you would rather see more experimentation tbh
340821,id say it works for any project where you need governance but yeah more experimentation with token models absolutely necessary
340822,
340823,
340824,i guess its hard for projects to just commit to try something new when that could tank their bags bigly but more wacky tokenomics ideas is a public good for the whole space
340825,i think its not even the best thing for a liquid staking protocol
340826,been lurking for ages and there are some big brains heredoes this mean there might be a way out after rug pulls soft rugs and hacks
340827,well liquidity is one but theres also a solid argument about fees
340828,yeah if it was only about liquidity dex volume would be 10x that of cexes
340830,but can the underlying blockchain scale to 10x binances throughput
340831,good question actually
340832,hopefully one day
340853,does anyone have examples of lido staking integration directly in the contract i am looking for a function which swaps eth for steth if the contract is audited as well that would be great
340872,assigned mutes bans no machine style native shill here pls thank you
340874,i meant the version people use is the one well care about in the end
340880,im still very curious if someone in here has an outsider perspective on v3 in the meantime beta has gone live
340882,is there any information on stake distribution in that validator set
340883,nan
340884,
340885,original source twittercomcryptocredstatus1516832921474240517
340886,binance as usual
340888,nan
340889,thats a good birthday present
340890,seems they have an inner battle
340891,i know crazy
340892,us treasury sanctions russian crypto miners its first sanction on mining
340893,nan
340894,also happy birthday to the guy that killed hitler d
340895,ivangbi its just funny if this is true then rihanna is in the gearbox dao because she has 100k gear tokensof course i dont think this is true but it would be fun if it was true
340898,wouldnt that be a simple fix that makes oracle attacks on fuse pools financially infeasible if you choose an appropriate gamma for the pooli dont think this would classify as a guard rail since borrowing power follows organic price increase on the time scale of the snapshot distance which could probably be chosen very aggressively something like a couple of hours or even shorterany thoughts on this is there a technical reason that prevents such a design
340899,gm lobsters my name is giancarlo sanchez im a software engineer working on a new web3 project dappify a nocode platform for launching dapps from templates such as nft marketplaces event bookings qr code payments and more every dapp is tokenized into an nft im looking for creative people that want to have their own custom branded nft marketplace our first template but perhaps dont know how to code or have the budget we can build them for free we are here to democratize the building experience in web3
340900,whos paying to make these checkpoints
340901,hm if you choose 24h checkpoints maybe simply the pool operator should be manageable what do you think
340902,how expensive is it roughly to write a 24h twap to chain
340903,24h sounds like a lifetime considering the volatility of things on there it might make sense for stablefiatcoins not so much for everything else as for cost vpepo has posted about stuff like that before
340904,this is a really interesting idea
340905,also relevant considering how infrequently their oracle is updated
340906,hey everyonedo you guys know where i could find info regarding protocols exploits and their correlation or not to auditsi found some info saying that 2122 of protocols exploited were unaudited but it doesnt mean much if we dont know the global percentage of unaudited protocols and the range studied like maybe top 1000 projects or something like that same goes with the info available on rekt
340907,its about 34 eth to initialize regarding reading it should be around 200k gas per call or so
340908,what they are proposing is somewhat similar to what is done in keep3r btw but it uses a 5 day twap
340910,correction reading should be about 25k gas per observe after initialization
340911,are some sources
340912,you can make this trigger on borrows after a 24h period went by if no one borrows it just gets updated whenever
340913,curious isnt this vulnerable to someone manipulating the price beforehand and then borrowing
340914,thanksyeah thats what ive been looking at what im wondering about is do we have the stats for the top 5001000 protocols to know how many of them are actually auditedi want to see if audits actually helps or refrain exploiters in any way which im not 100 convinced of
340915,whenever they borrow they update it so their collateral will be liquidated in the same block or rather in the next one
340916,because the manipulation cant happen within the same block like manipulation borrow
340917,hmm why not
340918,iirc the quote updates at the start of the new block
340919,you would manipulate it but it can be easily arbitragable if there is sufficient market for it
340920,not liquidated but the borrow would be rather limited due to the 24h twap 20 threshold
340921,note that because the oracle is only updated at most once every block calling observe with a secondsago value of 0 will return the most recently written observation which can only be as recent as the beginning of the current block or older
340922,you guys see this shit lol
340923,the univ3 oracle used on fuse isnt verified
340924,i guess this is the source code
340925,where can one find really good like top teir web designers for a crypto project dribbble seems like meh dono why but spent days on behance and couldnt find something good
340926,wait but if youre updating it once every x duration as with the checkpoints this doesnt work
340927,no the checkpoint is just a reference for the actual twap used
340928,every 24 hs you update the 24h twap in order to have a reference if the 15 minute twap goes 20 from the reference you just refuse the update and maintain the old value
340929,ah i see the reply
340930,slight tangent would that have done anything for the inverse exploit
340931,yeah
340932,because it would render the exploit almost nonprofitable
340933,ah wait no
340934,they used the keep3rv2 oracle for uniswapv2 contracts which works differently
340935,my comments are only related to how univ3 oracles work
340936,oh so this doesnt work for v2
340937,with the oracle that inv was using no
340938,but you could make it work tho
340939,am i wrong to assume itll require more frequent onchain updates to achieve the same thing
340940,it would be more gascostly but it should be the same frequency
340941,youll need to write to storage once in a while which is not too bad but youll need to reread the guard value every operation i guess
340942,yeah
340943,you also need to store the timestanp of the guard could perhaps lose precision on the price and pack them together since they both need reading at the same time
340944,not sure about tech implementation specifics sadly people at mean are doing an opinionated oracle for v3 if im not wrong should be on the same topic
340945,
340946,we propose to deprecate xsushi and relocate this revenue towards the sushidao with these funds sushi will achieve financial health will be able to grow the team create a sushi ecosystem fund and overall have enough money to scale the business
340947,you can also check defiyield rekt database
340948,just a reminder that today is the last day for a gyroscope testnet game
340949,arbitrage opportunity
340950,why its only for borrowing power say you have 10k of coin x deposited as collateral and are borrowing 9k against it now theres some bullish news and coin x rallies by 100 would it be such a big problem for you to wait 24 hours until you can borrow an additional 9k against your now twice as valuable collateral
340951,i was thinking about liquidations due to genuine price drops 30 and the like is hardly unprecedented
340952,nbanft and nation3 are crazy
340953,the checkpoint idea is only meant to protect the protocol against the standard attack 1 deposit collateral 2 manipulate oracle to increase borrowing power drastically 3 borrow as much assets as you can from the pool its effects on liquidations might be an issue is it possible to let the smart contract use a different value to decide eligibility of liquidations than the value it takes to decide borrowing power or must those 2 things fundamentally be linked together
340954,however i dont see whats the problem if price goes down could you elaborate are you worried that liquidations would not occur since the checkpoints are lagging notice that the proposal uses a minimum function mincollateral_pricegammalast_checkpoint_price so if price drops everything simply works as though the checkpoints dont exist checkpoints only have an effect if price increases
340955,what smart contracts power the nft marketplace
340956,fugaaaaziiiiiiii
340959,yes thats it the checkpointing works differently from what i had in mind
340962,
340963,does anyone have any intel on the caw koo and cluk situation
340964,
340965,i dont know wtf any of this means but you asked so here you go
340966,hi owen each dapp is an nft that orchestrates one or multiple smart contracts per each template the dapp is using the builders own that tokenized dapp nft and because of that ownership across all smart contracts within the app the smart contracts source we share them with the builders during the creation process so they are aware of the logiccan have someone validate it
340967,is advertising allowed in this group
340968,if you have to ask
340969,do you have them deployed on mainnet or docs would def be interested in peeping if theyre available
340970,not yet we plan on launching second week of may and are still ironing out a few things id love to invite you to our discord to answer all your questions
340971,sers question about coinbase wallet something weird is going on when signing a message on kovan mainnet the message is basically the same and on kovan it works just fine but on mainnet during the signing process sign it either uses some other method or some other fugezi happens is it because of the alert window that adds something extra and ruins it requiring a coinbase whitelist or what is it
340972,nan
340973,what function are you using to sign if i recall right there are several deprecated ones with different security concerns maybe this is ignored in testing but in prod it throws this warning edit nvm that was metamask but it could still be related if you can choose different sign functions maybe some dont require the wl
340974,nan
340976,
340977,maybe this helps the general issue seems to be that some signing functions are too generic and could be used to trick the user into signing a transaction instead of a message eip712 is the lastest attempt of solving this
340978,eip712 doesnt work properly with some hardware wallets unfortunately
340979,great i guess you would have to split the implementation for cb wallet and others then if this is actually the issue
340980,hey any devs who tested building anything on polygon rollups hermez i guess or starknet who want to share their experience trying to figure out which of those is more likely to win the race to integrate more stuff earlier
340981,probably the issue was related to ethers 544 because it seems to be fixed after update to 564
340982,which protocols are yfi forks on mainnet
340983,theres yfii aka dfi money not too sure where they are at now but looking at coingecko they are doing surprisingly well
340984,right i thought it was dead
340985,any other a bit more established
340986,harvestgro
340987,they are not yfi fork though coingecko has a nice research feature you can check there
340988,anyone has data on self hosted wallets hot marketshares
340990,uhm gro was leveraging yearns code back in the days though idk if they evolved since
340992,
340993,create2 otherwise thats stupid

340999,masterchef has seen better days ser
341000,
341001,i told that since snx enabled staking finally going into masses
341002,somehow over time the word staking has been repurposed and redefined instead of receiving rewards for contributing to chain security with collateral at stake modern staking just seems to mean idk we give you more coins as a reward if you dont sell your current coins lol
341006,at start only harvest stakedao and gro
341007,
341011,cant wait for a stablecoin backed by all other stable coins
341012,its not enough to watch one project blow up we must now watch the collapse of entire chains
341013,crypto needs this
341014,ya its coming
341015,we already have those from 2018
341016,theres even stalecoins related to datasets these days i think the next step will be makerdao but for jpegs
341017,nan
341018,this is definitely paid by do to make ust seem stable and safe relatively
341019,
341020,ponzis thenwe forked ampl our coin rebases to the price of milk we added three whole eth of liquidity collapses and maybe five figures are lostponzis now this new stable coin is backed by so much crypto asset its a reserve currencyyield bearing instrument dont believe us look at all this questionable math and flowery language that you dont understand collapses and brings down entire chains
341021,
341022,1inch has always done this this fud reemerges on twitter probably twice a year when they get called on it theres always users that learn about it for the first time though since 1inch wont publish that they do this
341023,could somebody tell me where i could see decentralized stable coin supply centralized stable coin supply ratio
341026,does anyone know any developer channel or group want to do a smart contract development preference survey for developers
341027,thanks guys
341028,telegraphcryptotelegramchannelschats0419
341029,omg this is amazing
341030,thanks man
341031,hey guys our staking contract selling tokens and sending to a mev address we are loosing eth and tokens both
341032,
341033,someone can help checking whats the mev bot its sending and why its selling tokens
341035,i think your web interface might be exploited somehow
341037,anyone got this full pdf
341038,thanks
341039,nan
341040,pinky promise i wont take your private keys
341041,i trust you
341042,my hero
341043,ser pls read the docs by direct vote of 1inch networks instant governance system all swap surplus amounts are distributed to both the 1inch network treasury and user referral rewards
341044,missed this whole conversation yesterday but strongly agree with this statement terminology is not well defined and its almost impossibe for the avg application to differentiate
341045,ive read the docs but its not clear to most users why they keep the surplus which is why you get these twitter mobs calling them out whenever it gets noticed again with a large amount
341046,i wasnt saying it wasnt clear to me ser
341047,its not something thats widely advertised and known by most users
341048,is binance down
341049,binance probably still celebrating 420 lol
341050,works fine for me
341051,oh its 403 he refuses to authorize me
341052,primordialaa exactly but as an example dunking on wrapped assets doesnt help we should be clear about the risk of both representational assets that escrow underlying and omnichain tokens which have no supply peg on one chain both are at risk of the underlying trustroot being compromised and the supply peg being broken
341053,do you see any fundamental technical obstacles to implementing something like that ser i dont have any visibility on twitter so its hard to get some feedback
341054,anything across any two chains is at risk of the underlying transport protocol being compromised this is the nature of messaging itself and why the work on improving validation mechanisms is so interesting
341055,very important point
341056,agreed so whats the solution to wrapped assets ive seen you and team criticize them but what is the solution to generating the representational liquidity that stargate capitalizes its liquidity pools withthe point im making here is the selective use of terminology to make a positioning marketing case that ignores that there is still risk since we agree that in an early industry we need to help educate and not vocabulary launder
341057,so the issue with wrapped assets is very clearly that it carries risk post transactionie there is a tx of x from a b there is risk during the transaction but also for entire duration that b exists so if you have 20b outflow of insert total wrapped flow from chain a chain b you will have 20b standing risk forever until its unwrapped meaning not only if the transport like is corrupted during the tx but at any point after the tx this risk and the end user always carries exposure to it with something like stargate you pay a higher premium for latent liquidity but it completely removes standing risk ie 20b of outflow from chain a chain b can be done without the user ever being exposed to risk outside of risk during their immediate tx and without overall system risk ever exceeding the amount currently in the stargate pools
341058,youre 100 correct that the escrow risk persists indefinitely post settlement layer transfer but two questions1 how do we get exposure to assets like eth that have a supply peg on mainnet we need a representational asset to capitalize the pools in a liquidity network like stargate right unless were only ever expecting fully native deployments like usdc which permissionless tokens dont offer2 what youre flagging is application risk in the smart contract that performs the escrow function if this is bulletproof does your apprehension go away
341059,if the answer is an omnichain token with native deployments everywhere that rebalance liquidity using l0 then again the trust root is the risk
341060,thanks for answering qs btw
341061,2 is basically taken care of by the light client bridge model
341062,1 youll never get native gas assets on any other chain without wrapping thats extremely clear i think the more interesting question is if you wantneed to but ill save that for another day 2 no its not if the consensus layer fails that standing risk is still exposed smart contract risk persists in any method period nobody solves for this other than by writing good code the problem with the standing 20b risk in the example is that the validationconsensus layer fails or is corrupted and forges tx
341063,well yes and no
341064,i would say yes you obviously disagree
341065,2 yeah but this is true for the omnichain assets as well if the trustroot is compromised those tokens get inflated too
341066,going from say ethereum to avalanche you still need need somebody to pass the next block right there is still exposure to those people being malicious and it not being verified
341067,of course like i said all transport layers carry this risk
341068,the question is the shapesurface of it
341069,then you cant criticize wrapped assets for that
341070,its not an apples to apples criticism
341071,what do you mean wrapped assets carries standing risk stargate carries static risk
341072,its fairly clear
341073,but jackzampolin to be clear weve been very straightforward forever that we think light client model is the best current model its just impractical in most current systems if gas on other chains reduced by a factor of 100010000 we would absolutely implement it as a validation library and have it be default for everything
341074,so i agree with you but it doesnt completely get rid of 2
341075,see i would disagree w the impractical in current systems
341076,it still carries some risk of building a fraudulent chain from the prior state
341077,i know you would haha
341078,we can disagree on that
341079,and im building a bunch of light client implemenations
341080,good
341081,looking forward to them
341082,you have to trust the chains you are transacting on
341083,this is what i mean by terminology confusion ser what were arguing about is application specific risk vs risk of trust root youre arguing that if the trust root fails then escrowed assets can be rugged this is truebut this affects all tokens that need to maintain a supply peg whether through wrapping or transport layer mint and burn
341084,and the people passing headers to the header between the chains
341085,ethereum is not writing headers to avalanche
341086,some group of nodes or individuals are doing this
341087,no because if you can verify the headers then you dont need to trust the relayers
341088,and that is a vector
341089,trusted relayers are a vector
341090,it could
341091,not in the current state p
341092,but yes hypothetically it could
341093,with bls and precompiles shouldnt be bad
341094,anyway gotta run yall have fun
341095,we have an eth light client that we will run on the cosmos side
341096,cya pranaymohan
341097,and on the ethereum side
341098,l8r pranaymohan
341099,we will have a cosmos light client
341100,and who writes the state data between each
341101,will be very gas expensive till we get some optmizations like precompiles
341102,relayers
341103,the on chain clients ensure that the state transitions are valid
341104,and is there a world where the relayers can be malicious and write a false header from a forged chain
341105,ie prior chain 1 forged block as next block
341106,no because that would be an invalid state transition
341107,not with the current light client security model
341108,how does the contract on cosmos side verify the validity of the next block with 100 certainty and vice versa on ethereum
341109,we have the previous validator set and we can verify that the validator set didnt change by more than trust threshold between state transitions
341110,and if that validator set is malicious
341111,also anyways thats very consensus specific clearly
341112,you have to trust the chains you are transacting on
341113,yes but the validator set of ethereum isnt necessarily interested in the security of cosmos and vice versa
341114,incentives are totally different
341115,they arent interested in the security of cosmos
341116,nor should they be or would that affect the validity of the connection
341117,so jackzampolin so are you trying to represent that this is impossible
341118,because very clearly its not
341119,but regardless love what youre doing buddy pleasure as always 3 im sure ill see you in a twitter thread about me shortly haha
341120,23 of the eth valset would have to sign state transition that invalidated the ibc connection
341121,good work on the raise and excited to see more layerzero products
341122,this is why i say with ibc you just need to trust the chains you are running on
341123,yes but it can be honest on the main chain and fraudulent on external chain if relayers and validators are colluding
341124,thanks lets chat in person sometime soon im sure ill catch you at a conference
341126,looks like you fixed it by blacklisting your own contracti think your contract is buggy and allows nonstaker to unstake any amount
341127,lol that is a funnylooking function
341128,yes blacklisted contract to avoid any transfer of tokens by hackers
341129,which function
341130,function unstake uint256 amount public uint256 sendamount amount irrelevant loop if youre not a staker staketokentransfermsgsender sendamount totalunstakedtoken totalunstakedtokenaddsendamount stakersmsgsendertotalunstakedtokenuser stakersmsgsendertotalunstakedtokenuseraddsendamount emit unstakemsgsender sendamount
341131,unless im missing something the claim function is broken in the same way
341132,where is the loop
341133,
341134,i dont get the issue
341135,why does it matter that the loop is irrelevant it wont even enter if sender is not a staker
341136,that is the point
341137,why would i unstake then
341138,read this
341139,read
341140,what now
341141,a bot tried this to drain staking pool
341142,ooh i think i get it maybe
341143,
341144,wont statetokentransfer revert if sendamount is too big and or if sender is not a staker
341145,no
341146,that sounds retarded if i may use the rough language
341147,oh
341148,im the retarded in this situation
341149,yes i see
341150,ok so why did he fail
341151,good investigation guys
341152,we can make a blocksec startup
341153,staking contract is blacklisted now
341154,asking users to vote to get less money lol
341155,this whole ecosystem is just playing hot potato why would we want to turn off money printer comp eventually will die to some other incentive program aave will eventually too rotators rotate the world turns over was any of this meant to last beyond first few years of liquidity incentives
341156,look who was for it a16z was half of the vote for it but of course
341157,this just isnt true plenty of protocols do fine without money printers yearn maker uniswap etc
341158,shocker
341159,i think theres something to be said about the lindyness of something like compound or aave vs new lending protocols with high incentives yes hot money will rotate to the new things but as noncrypto biz fintechs institutions etc are looking for a yield partner theyll be looking to compound and aave not new hot money thing from my casual reading of this it seems like gfx presented good arguments that cutting comp rewards by 50 did not have a drastic impact on tvl and that it seems like most of the concerns were around it felt too rushed cutting incentives to 0
341160,i know
341161,bolting governance onto centralized products after launch is not the greatest idea
341162,we built it in at a deep level in cosmos so there are many more votes and the changes take place on chain immediately
341163,
341164,just take a look at the osmosis governance its real busy and they have great turnout
341165,lets see what a16z come up for uni
341166,ser bragging about a cartelized dpos network like cosmos is rich
341167,2019 called and it wants its narrative back
341168,also ibc is a federation of pos chains which is a pretty decentralized construction
341169,and im bill gates grandson
341170,i think what we see in compound governance is much more centralized than what is going on in cosmos even on individual chains
341171,
341172,
341173,have any of these done anything note worthy recently all they seem to do is lose market share
341174,so again 2019 called it wants it narrative back
341175,tfw you compare random dapp multisigs to a broken consensus model
341176,i dont think you can call a consensus model that secures hundreds of billions in production broken
341177,but dont worry this doesnt fit the narrative you guys have gone to great lengths to passing yourselves off as just pos total decentralized after all
341178,ive heard this over and over i get where you are coming from sorry you dont like proof of stake
341179,what would it need for you to change the situation what is the golden number of nodes to call it decentrlaized
341180,lol this is on the level of eos claiming its more decentralized than ethereum because of a paintjpg screenshot
341181,ummm our nakamoto coefficent is higher than eth 2
341182,just on the hub
341183,continue to parrot outdated criticism of cosmos model is real boring theres real activity on our chains now and ibc is far and away the most used interoperabilty model
341184,nodes are irrelevant to the brokenness of dpos
341185,brokenness please expand on this ser
341186,my nodes are producing blocks every 5 seconds
341187,if i call it outdated enough times it will go away
341188,no it wont youll continue to say it as will others
341189,stating the same thing over and over as you are doing doesnt make it true tho
341190,says the one regurgitating the criticism is outdated
341191,well you keep saying pos is broken without backing it up with facts
341192,your entire retort to this is an embarrassing tangent about multisigs
341193,or propositions on a path forward
341194,embarassing how
341195,your calling cosmos a cartel but a 35 is a real cartel
341196,wtf is this tweet lol
341197,the point where you think such a ridiculous tangent is relevant to what ryan was talking about
341198,well it is
341199,
341200,i mean they continue to be dominant in their individual areas which is a pretty incredible feat given that the industry is a hot ball of incentives their products work very well and retain market share shows that you dont need to play ponzi games if your product is good enough i honestly dont know how yearn does it their fee structure is such an easy way to outcompete them crazy ability to retain talent and mindshare
341201,saying every protocol is a glorified 35 multisig is stupid and untrue
341202,if you want people to argue in good faith and take you seriously you gotta do better
341203,im not saying that im saying that many are
341204,eth people make 0 effort to understand what is being built in cosmos im tired of the same old takes that dont reflect reality i would also ask you to do better
341205,your tweet says it
341206,well the vast majority of eth defi contracts are owned by multisigs or single signer keys
341207,am i off base there
341208,please correct me if im wrong
341209,ryan your network is a cartelyou well some of the things built on your network is cartelized therefore something i hope is irrelevant to what youre saying
341210,anyone wanna engage on this point
341211,also cosmos isnt a cartel
341212,i mean one of the largest defi protocols in existence is technically a 35 multisigcertainly not all but that is a conversation worth having
341213,the top validators in different chains are a disjoint set
341214,thank you robanon
341215,i dont know how you define most and what you think is acceptable for a multisig to do looking at top 10 in tvl on ethereum though i would say most have a reasonable level of decentralisation at the protocol level
341216,granted i think multisig is far better than halfbaked governance and abandoning ownership is even better
341217,reasonable level of decentralization
341218,abandoning ownership best
341219,thats a blanket statement that you cant apply to every protocol
341220,whats the point of yearn if they abandon ownership
341221,how would you define this in cosmos hub would take 8 top validators colluding to halt chain
341222,even if 100 of the apps on ethereum were so it would still be irrelevant
341223,jack knows this
341224,how many defi protocols in the top 10 would meet that bar
341225,i dont think its irrelevant at all
341226,look at the recent bridge hacks
341227,thats why hes brought it up to distract from what was said
341228,i think in the top 10 only two protocols can be halted
341229,with state actor s beginning to take an interest in the space these type of security things need to be discussed and dealt with
341230,how many entities does it take to exercise control over those protocols
341231,what is best is often not what is reasonable its an unattainable goal to be strived for not a reasonable milestone to set in many cases but certainly figuring out what you can abandon ownership for over time is ideal obviously the longer you go without a breach the more battletested the code can be considered
341232,what are you on about
341233,color me surprised lol
341234,
341235,by this list
341236,im pretty sure most of the top 10 has admin keys behind them
341237,admin keys to do what
341238,whats the actual security offered by these protocols
341239,upgrade the contracts
341240,which could also be used to steal funds
341241,i said there are two in the top 10
341242,i know wormhole polygon and hex have admin keys at least
341244,i bet if we dug in more we would find more
341245,you clearly have no clue what youre talking about
341246,this is a bs list sorry
341247,lol if nothing else congrats on a distraction well executed
341248,well share a better one
341249,exactly what is this list
341250,
341251,210 have upgradeability
341252,well thats great good to hear i think once you get out of the top 10 that number starts going down quickly
341253,ugh
341254,stop trading
341255,put the phone down
341256,newest report we published over at analyst dao always looking for more writers hmu if you want to collab on something
341257,algod bet v2
341258,the new taro announcement is really cool multi asset lightning network transfers and hops
341262,hey i am rust dev slowly trying to get into web3 space what other communities are out there that i should join
341263,only farm42 community is enough to improve your skills
341264,check out sir rururururu_ruru
341266,is paradigmfundio same as paradigmxyz
341267,thank you
341269,what do you mean by eth2 has the same design ser
341270,sorry if off topic but just saw this curious what folks think
341271,better release with some geiger nfts
341273,is still the best bet for cheap access to an archive node also do you have any recommendations for cheap access to archive nodes on other chains ftm bsc and avax preferably with generous rate limits i plan to use it for historical bulk data retrievalso latency not too important i tried moralis and ankr but got immediately rate limited thanks
341274,is fomosaurus here want to dm him for sth
341275,if your budget isnt limited you can check stuff like infura enterprise or quicknode enterprise
341276,archive nodes are expensive af
341277,how many requestsmo are you looking at were providing 3m archive requests for 49 at chainstack
341278,can do some custom plan depending on the ask as well lmk in pm if interested we provide archive data for all aforementioned chains ftm bsc and avax and more
341279,futureswap is a case of centralized governance dao is just a design to avoid legal risksthe governance contract is not open source no one can propose new proposals most proposals end with 100 and 1 address votingit is possible to skip the set governance framework and directly initiate a proposal which is a joke in dao
341280,maybe people really have to think about what is governance token
341281,i got banned from discord for different reasons tho lol
341282,i got banned too
341283,oh
341284,ngmi
341285,nan
341286,the address seems to be participating on scam token launchs
341287,they added this 3 days ago
341288,most governance tokens are exactly the same even prominent oneseg kp3r has absolutely 0 governancetreasury rightsvotespowerbut you lock for vetokens for voting kek
341289,we could use help with the rust version of rmrkapp if youre interested in giving us a hand we could show you around you can see how it feels dm me if so
341290,hey sounds really cool i will dm you
341291,wnuelle see pm
341292,hey lobsters i am doing some research on how will the crypto market look like in 2025 thinking on these lines financials market outlook emerging sectors regulations landscape other interesting trends to get a peek into futurewould love to get some pointers
341293,better ui i hope
341294,look back at predictions three years ago and talk to the few people that were correct about how they made their predictions
341295,2025people are raising money for building prediction markets and defi insurance
341296,except for john mcafee im sure no one predicted a 3 trillion market cap three years ago
341297,lmao
341298,that about lmao
341299,so basically anyone who makes the correct prediction dies
341301,how do you incentivise arbitrage without fees
341302,by not having aggregators
341303,soon tm there are really interesting papers on extending nakamoto consensus to scale to the physical limits of the hardware seems like a credible path tooprism
341304,even without aggregators trading fees are necessary to compensate lps for impermant arbitrage loss more on it here if you really wanna get into it
341305,if anyone keen pls dm txs
341306,there is a risk of survivor bias
341307,it might get you closer to than the alternative
341308,or it might give you a false sense of certainty i would say this is actually the most likely
341309,for point 24 we are working collabing in decentralized science or desci many of desci projects are inspired by defi but due to novelty lack primitives protocols nor codeknowlegde base as defi from one perspective desci is aligning more towards nft both technically and aesthetically but i think changing angleofattacks economically convolutions and modelbased systems will emerge and present revelations that will one day have desci stand sidebyside with defi you or anyone feel free to shoot dm if you want to shoot on this
341310,crossprotocol margin
341311,derivs positions as collateral
341312,rpc providers become hyper regulated maybe to the point of another hard fork
341313,we have pokt network for that right
341314,you could try alchemy their free plan supports archive calls
341315,in what sense you can run one for like less than 2k with erigon
341316,only thing is youll need to up your ssds on an annual basis kek
341317,for chains other than ethereum its pretty costly to run
341318,also if doing etl on bulk data from all chains gonna need a fuckton more storage than what the nodes require on their own and that is excluding backups maintainence etc
341319,ah yes can imagine the other chains from eth will cost more
341320,thanks for eth alchemy worked best so far but still got ratelimited quickly
341321,ooo thats a fun one
341322,erigon team gonna have to work double time to release compliant binaries for all regions
341323,is there a defi ethics similar to nft ethics
341324,very good points and nfts are proving to be quite usefull even funding
341325,whats everyones thoughts about fantom here are you guys seeing activity returning any time soon or it just keeps declining from here other than the grant program starting in june there doesnt seem to be anything else that could bring eyes back to fantom
341326,centralized gateway though so decentralized but is it
341327,sir they have fvm coming and their cex felix
341328,do you think thats enough to bring the activity back afaik fvm wont be fully launched for some time theyll just start rolling upgrades from q2 also whats the thing with felix why is that a big deal
341329,yeah afaik fvm is a ways out felix is a speculatory big deal in my book just because it will directly on board users to ftm as opposed to eth bsc or cro
341330,will get back thats where most of the innovation happens and its 410x undervalued vs other l1 on pretty much all metrics tvl number active wallets protocols
341331,people got burnt but fundamentals are strong
341332,whats felix
341333,will be their cex akin to cryptocom and binance
341334,its also a dag which i think a lot of people tend to overlook as well as the lachesis consensus mechanism
341336,has someone created a decentralized tornado cash frontend
341337,afaik felix is not directly related to fantom opera as it is a cex it is hard to state that it can be on blockchain at all furthermore it is a product of tomb finance team and their pm harry yeh which works independently from fantom foundation
341338,pm prime minister
341339,project manager
341340,fuck binance if its true
341341,ty
341342,fyi uniwhales launched a free version of their wallet alerts bot tracking 10 evm chains evmtrackerbot in case you are interested here is an explanatory threadoor about it
341343,ill leave link for bot here evmtrackerbot
341344,
341345,that just happened to me
341346,was buying an nft and everything is frozen here for half an hour already
341347,ahh hope some metamask experts can help me here i keep getting loading tokens on my accounts on all browsers and on different laptops my tokens are in my wallet but i cant get access to them anybody knows what to do i googled and activated the metamask can read and change all your data on all sites but still doesnt work
341348,maybe change rpc
341349,i think it is having issues at the momen t
341350,
341351,oh shit thanks
341352,
341353,changed the rpc on ethereum want to bridge to near but it still doesnt find the token for some reason do i need to change esomething on the aurora side as well
341354,nvm finally it works
341355,
341356,fan token is good
341357,they should rebrand to troll at this point ticker lol
341358,too funny
341359,stripe launches a crypto feature that lets twitter users get paid in stablecoin cnbc reported
341360,
341361,this is starting to look like we will see a repeat of how zuck just wanted to compare hot girls and ended up in a senate hearing when the sec realise theres only a small multisig centralised in india protecting investors
341362,roatoors in cope
341363,i definitely dont have a problem and definitely dont need this
341364,after these rpc issues i feel like my money is safer on cexes
341365,t cz
341366,learn how to use different rpcs instead lol
341367,
341368,always works for me
341369,the coin too
341380,
341381,dex
341382,they mean addresses
341383,not wallet providers
341384,in case thats not clear
341385,they been doing that for years already geographically no
341386,frontend only issok
341387,this is so useless but they are forced to do it prob
341388,no it was this year
341389,they have removed assets previously a while back
341390,
341391,this is what i mean
341392,
341393,maybe i have reading issues but i see what it brings to the exploited peoplebut whats the benefit of the people helping with the raise or is cheaper silo the thing
341394,vitalik fudding on stage
341395,saying bugs to fix blabla in clients
341396,bloody reptile cant stop the merch
341397,how i read it is getting in early at seed round phase you get upside of the platform growth i like what they are doing
341398,you can go straight to the contract sure now consider etherscan also blocked transactions from your address how many folks know what to do next
341399,ye but seed round stage of what maybe im just too confused by much text i usually read max 1 paragraph a day
341400,hahaha
341401,vitalik live
341402,easily the most overlooked web3 problem is decentralized frontends
341403,
341404,centralized as it is nasachain dfinity had the right idea
341405,his outfit is almost normal
341406,with something like uniswap its moot integrations bring client side decentralisation with something like tornado i agree
341407,are those unisocks that vitalik is flexing
341409,erigonakula grant proposal on vote
341410,gj ser
341411,why eth global have only 16k subs while pumpers and dumpers have over 300400k subs on youtube
341412,eth global not halping the by organising soo many events
341413,because the entry threshold into the real sector requires a bit of attention and doesnt promise you a put a thousand in take two out level of return requires intelligent reading talking to people researching cases
341414,and only 100 people watching onlinenothing newthis is how crypto works1000 retail plebs vs 10 buildersresearches
341415,because plebs cant differentiate between alfa and pile of hot stinking dudu
341416,to be fair the other 900 are probably at the venue
341417,but yes
341419,how long r the sponsors gonna talk for
341421,link
341422,
341423,osmosis is voting to add a canonical bridge to its ecosystem what are your thoughts on wormhole as the canonical ethereum bridge for osmosis
341424,they also have axelar nomad gravity bridge none of these as the other proposals there was a proposal to decide how these voting procedure would happen before that 205
341427,wormhole like most of the other bridges use a set of validators that makes it a trusted party being their hostage is a high risk for any chainnomad is the only actually trust minimized solution there
341429,yup this is the one owned by the dao and has to go through governance to update the ens
341430,anyone from tesseract any news
341431,ncerovac
341432,an article about how we do frontend decentralisation
341433,friends whats the latest on running your own eth node for use with your dapp i mean front end will always use whatever rpc the client wallet uses right but back end can rely on your own i remember there was something like geth lite in the works so you dont need the gazillion storage still a thing
341434,
341435,
341437,ouh
341438,or sleeping bc its night
341439,hey ser news about
341445,the projects progress where to find any news
341446,hey ser yes so yearn discord tesseract channel deployed on polygon and avax atm sadly had hickups last 2 months and hiring time so we weere a bit slower on adding new strats changing as we speak
341447,thx god i dont have a token so less shitting on me
341448,hi guys any ideas how to mass send tokens from cex
341449,depends on what cexbasically move funds to automated relayer script that will proceed your bulk transfers
341450,i wanted the address of the exchange to appear as the withdrawal wallet
341451,then build a script that would call cexs api for withdrawals
341458,stablecoins everywhere every layer 1 with their own stablecoin i put my hands on fire that we are gonna see the next generation of stablecoins from here till 2025 frax and his partialcollateral the mix between onchain and offchain collateral will be the starting point of new mechanisms
341459,near just a chainrose just a chainavax just a chain the next big thing just a chain
341462,does anyone know a poker platform thats crypto only and with mm integration
341463,decentral games
341464,perfect thanks
341466,gm lobsters just finished writing an article about storing crypto securely opsec tips and awesome references i hope it will be useful3 graphorgkeyprinciplesofstoringcryptocoldwalletattacksdefensemethodsbestpracticesbonus0423
341468,where is the decentralization here
341469,does anyone have the solidly talk discord channel link
341470,agreed it is only the beginning of the stablecoin innovation journeyim currently looking into yieldbearing stablecoins that never leave your wallet
341471,hi guys what smart contracts do under the hood when we execute abc function b public returns address return msgsender function abc public returns address return thisb what is opcode when we do thisb
341472,i just dont understand is it call delegatecall or callcode
341473,check volt protocol
341474,just watched the trailer golden
341475,stableunit is working on this as well
341476,our frontend domains are owned by the dao avoids single person owning a eth domain avoids dns names that are bound to censorship and tied to a single email only way to make frontend updates are to make a governance proposal and can be turned down by the rep holders if found its a bad update rep is non transferable governance token that can be earned only through contribution to the daothe way we achieve this is by handing over the ens domain to the dao proposal created to update ens to point to new ipfs hash voted and boosted by the governance process and if passed ens now points to new ipfs hashwe have no google analytics or any analytics that depends upon centralised parties if you want to privately use uniswap sushiswap you can always use swapreth as it directly talks to their contracts without taking any fee routing through another contract its pretty decentralised compared to every other frontend i would say
341477,its a call just like if it were a crosscontract call
341478,hmm this tells me an entity rather than an individual owns an ens name how is the frontend decentralizeduniswap has a dao too as does tornadocash both of them filter bad addresses in their frontends
341479,but does the dao control frontend or uniswap labs
341480,is it a single person deploying the changes or is it a dao
341481,a dao cant control the website or front end
341482,why not
341483,sure it can ethsites
341484,uniswaporg is controlled and owned by a new york private company
341485,why not thats what we are doing
341486,hey i was trying to do some research on a token and came across something weird if you take a look at their pools the positions were generated with only the erc20 tokens and 0 usdc anyone has any idea what is going on
341487,someone owns the domain and pays the server bills thats the person in control what your dao decides does not matter to regulators or from a legal perspective
341488,well and if we speak about blockchain dns ie bazar
341489,just wondering
341490,eth domains ipfs frontend so
341491,if its ens and uses ipfs which is free for now there is nothing centralised that is needed
341492,icann will always look to a registrar
341493,well eth with ipfs hash gets around that
341494,someones name is always on there
341495,no one is talking about icann
341496,i am aware but thats not the case for uniswap or tornado right now
341497,set a dao as the address able to modify records and it is fully on chain
341498,we werent talking about uniswap or tornado either
341499,you kind of were scroll up
341500,the attempted misdirection might be interesting to cryptonians but i dont think were a dao makes your frontend decentralized any more than its on the darknet helped the last guys that got rekt
341501,i was not saying this but did you read through our process of deployment because it is decentralised to the extent that all the deploys are on chain and traceable i was saying our deploys go through a dao and never said we are a dao
341502,isnt the point that they took all the steps necessary for their dao to decentralize the frontend
341503,isnt this the one thing that wed need to change at the core to allow this
341504,or just come up with a system that doesnt depend on icann like ens
341505,no you need more than that you need a full shadow dns system
341506,i did which is why i asked its a dao does not hold water
341507,hmm thats a valid point if the dao is considered as a legal entity instead of just a community then in that case no website frontend can be truly decentralised
341508,sure but i mean in terms of reaching into the existing social system not just the tech on top of it
341509,you can also just let people download the frontend verify the contents and run it themselves the main problem is how all of this interferes with usability and security concerns it is not impossible in principle but comes with tradeoffs people do not seem to be ready for
341510,true thats why when most of them say we are dao and have their dapps on org or fi and other icann websites we kinda feel cringe
341511,intelligent reply
341512,a dao doesnt mean a frontend agree with most of the stuff above alex
341513,sushi claims to be decentralized but who owns sushicom
341514,its a single person
341515,no but daos should own their frontend
341516,more like its a dao does not make your frontend decentralizedas for whether a dao constitutes a legal entity thats probably gonna end up in a thorny conversation but uh its not a governance token if theres nothing welldefined to govern
341517,agree here the tradeoffs is the long deploy process it takes about 5 days for us to update our ens to point to new ipfs hash
341518,for our governance we use holographic consensus and not token based pretty resilient towards whale voting or buying up tokens to pass proposals
341519,you can check here how our frontend deploy goes through onchain governance
341520,hmm having your frontend available on ipfs achieves a flow to similar effect you have a hash thats guaranteed to point to the same files you can look up to see if that hash is the one that was updated onchain as a txt record on an ens that is controlled by a contract with onchain governance
341521,now wrap that all in a way thats digestible for an average user and make sure its not slow as fuck and were good to go the way i see it is that people like you and me can already easily run their own or access decentralized frontends but thats not what matters for a product like uniswap
341522,hmm but thats where browsers like brave or services like ethlink comes in the guarantees still exist but the way to access is abstracted away its not perfect and ofcourse introduces points of failure but still a way for an average user to access the site
341523,someone needs to host that though having something on ipfs doesnt offer anything in and of itselfyou can either do that yourself in which case you dont need to think too hard about how you can be shutdownor you let cloudflare do it in which case see aboveor this ethlimo which says a lot without saying anything at all further reading links to medium with the same content the privacy policy and tos are certainly quite interesting
341524,right the initial pinner is still liable afaik
341525,but one can run his own ipfs pinner
341526,ofc higher technical learning curve than just downloading and running locally back to the start
341527,i think we are circling back to yic_alexs point of tradeoffs
341528,shouldve probably started with this but what does decentralized frontend even mean maybe its just me but owned by x surely isnt it
341529,id lean towards controlled by x
341530,controlled and governed by x and the x is not a single person or multisig
341531,the process is slow as fuck but i sincerely believe we need to do more towards frontend decentralisation
341532,i was so skeptical about tvl since the time where protocols started printing their farming shitcoins locked 90 supply of it on its own protocol and integrated shitcoins of another farms as a part of tvlespecially funny to see bridges or stablecoin farms with billions of tvl where liquidity utilization is around 01so here is an alternative metric tpv total productive value
341533,if were ethereum or similar would that be a decentralized frontend would tornadocash need to filter addresses
341534,i dont understand how filtering addresses would help for the optics it looks great that these hackers cant use the frontend but is it same for etherscan the contracts are still open source and can be used right
341535,the point is they wouldnt need to do it even for optics if the ui were decentralized
341536,at least if a decentralized frontend is one defined as my frontend is decentralized even though it allows limitless access to x nobody can shut it down
341537,they obviously succumbed to legal pressure no so if tornado dao was sufficiently decentralised then maybe they wouldnt have filtered addresses in the first place
341538,rugged by not having ivangbi at the booth
341539,nan
341540,
341541,isnt merge expected ard august
341543,my ser let me eat brb soon
341544,how would dao benefit social communities i do not quite get this point are there any good existing examples where dao has already benefited social communities i understand that it brings selfpolicyselfgovernance to the community but i cannot see why dao would be big in social environment maybe im missing a crucial point
341545,
341546,i just notice what you said its so strange
341549,but its allowed to add single side token on uniswap v3
341550,its a v3 pool
341551,nan
341552,only add 342901 usdc to the pool
341553,any simple staking smart contracts to study
341554,masterchef from sushiswap
341555,great write up to add to the discussion tvl shouldnt be tied to a tokens market cap which is a ratio i often see on metric sites as a tokens goal isnt to match tvl amount i dont see the correlation apart from speculative valuation tvl or tpv in your case in my eyes is more so the lifeblood of a protocol where high tvl equates to a healthy protocol that has high usage liquidity for trades and team is getting paid and vice versa for low tvl imo the narratives got to change at some point as the ratio between mctvl is meaningless and would be better to have an estimated annualized inflationdeflation rate
341556,i love lobsterdao so much alpha thank you
341557,what alpha here
341558,discussion information and thoughts spread etc
341559,playpen is good too
341560,did anyone here migrate from hardhat to foundry forge im curious to hear opinions from someone who actually did that it sounds cool to write tests in solidity but migrating existing tests and automation pipelines is quite painful
341561,im in the process of doing that and work with people that already did i have some opinions and concerns stills to check
341562,was actually exchanging a couple of messages with gakonst and other people here in ams about that
341563,hello team does anyone know does the lobster token on the cardano network have any value or functionality
341564,but on your direct concern you can have both coexist in the same codebase so you dont necessarily have to migrate the test suite
341565,there is no lobster token on any network we have only an nft collection hereany discussions about lobs nfts here
341566,id say the decentralized frontend should be censorshipresistant where no one can censor or put a limit on how connected wallets interact with underlying protocol on a public blockchain
341567,
341568,buying more gear
341569,ivan laserfocused on mikko presenting
341570,hahahah gg ivangbi
341571,
341572,ooof that merch so good
341573,nan
341574,ivan rugged so he is not lobs anymore
341575,cool were here too
341576,print me and i might just like u again
341577,paulcr2009 did you order sneakers
341578,u are shell to us now we dont need u
341579,in cardano is a token not nft
341580,whatever it is its not related to this group
341581,lobster daily 390 daily recap 22 april1 how will the crypto market look like in 2025link to discussion 2 what do you think of fantomlink to discussion 3 uniswap labs now blocks certain crypto wallets from its apps frontend link link to discussion 4 why eth global have only 16k subs while pumpers and dumpers have over 300400k subs on youtubelink to discussion 5 announcing the barn raise a public tenday fundraiser to restore beanstalklink link to discussion
341582,is there anyone here or can someone point to from zk university was looking to understand if still possible to join the cohort starting in 1 week
341583,lowkey bored apes vibes idk
341584,u will die in pain
341585,dd
341586,
341587,oh shit ive missed this after being the first one to propose such ting
341588,lol and anyone could have been using even imsi catcher any sniffer or even perform dns poisoning wwwlinkedincompulsehowcollectmobilenumberssmsmarketinglegalwayhewdawson
341589,thats why important do not ever take a working phone sim or pc with you when attending any public place i described it here githubcomoffcierciacryptoopsecselfguardroadmap
341590,nice of him to confirm hes the one that got it in his pocket
341591,still not 100 confident he wasnt there tbh
341593,can u expand on this ivan on tech u mean
341594,great so that means youd recommend people to switch to foundry for harthat like testing given that its not zero switching effort what upsides do you enjoy most
341595,for pure solidity dev hacking foundry all the waythe benefit of hardhat for me is having a js test suite that serves as live documentation really useful in my case since im working with frontend developers that are new to web3 since they use the same tools as the js tests mostly ethersjs they could just check the highlevel specs i implemented instead of poking me for everythingalso hardhatdeploy is really confortable to use and theres no equivalent yet on foundry at least last i checked there was a discussion on github about implementing deploys in solidity as well i get the point no context switching not needing to learn two languages but at that point it feels like using the wrong tool for the job
341596,
341597,
341598,similar concept but more mainstream with good search engines within those apps on coingecko as an example if you search a nonindexed term it just returns error example error correct
341599,interesting zerion above debank and zapperedit had to much to drink zapper right above it
341600,zerion is the only one that shows historical chart of the portfolio balance even tho right now its completely broken for some addresses
341602,you can also press on coinmarketcap and coingecko to go to the search bar
341603,i use a combination of ddg and personal settings but bangs worth a look eg eth
341604,you can take a look at ours audited btw report coming a bit later after retests with final small recommendation fixes will add the report in repo once its confirmed
341605,or the most pumpable cummies cumrocket apes pretty fun and quite profitable if you can read the room and ride the wave
341608,it can its actually a very nice exploit pattern
341609,also by consequence an address that was previously detected as addressiscontractaddr can later break that same condition so you cant cache this check
341610,as for immutables changing youll find this one interesting
341611,thx
341612,yes its interesting since you can also just change any data regarding on block related data blocktime etc
341613,thank you will read it in morning
341614,wow do you talk to your mother with this mouth incredibly rude
341616,u would know if hes there the bartenders will ask him to leave bcoz hes 12
341617,im the founder of a web3 project called atomize were trying to help daos create an onchain presense and i notiecd that lobster dao has a lot of the things were looking to prmote
341618,i was looking at this page here specifically
341619,gm sir please join for daorelated things3
341620,looks like soyjack
341621,does it make a difference if how i return value from a function returns uint256 foo or returns uint256 return foo or its just some is more preferred due to convention thx
341622,unless it becomes possible to host a frontend on the network like you would a contract that is probably not going to work
341623,agree fontend hosts are always going to be liable for anything that happens on what they provide but you could as a protocol make it worth it for people to host the front end via financial incentives
341624,posted a premint link for ml spots for cryptofighters alliance for anyone interesteddont want to spam this chat but welcome to see the link there
341628,im looking to buld something to track hisorical balances for an address converted to dollars and would be grateful for any suggestions i plan is to collect historical data with something like ethereumetl and modify lib to make it work with other chains im less sure about how to get pointintime pricing data for historical holdings for coins in the wallet i could find most liquid pool at the time from a hand picked selection of dexs for farming positions i guess i could go protocol by protocol to figure out how to to price lp tokens historically eg uniswap v2 v3 will need custom solutions is there a simpler way to get histprical pricing of holdings that doesnt require special treatment for each protocol thanks for any pointers
341629,zerion is the only one that shows historical chart of the portfolio balance even tho right now its completely broken for some addresses
341631,well thats interesting
341632,nice read imowdyt
341633,not a technical person myself but
341634,gm anyone can help out on how to get a large sum of eth on kovan testnet i used a couple of faucets but the amounts were far smaller than the desired amount appreciate it
341635,how much
341636,100 keth
341638,wouldnt a subgraph be the best option
341640,dmd we are still trying to help out a couple of ppl but no luck
341646,first case doesnt require the explicit return foo and usually results in less lines of code as also no uint256 foo 1234 is needed in the function body but they are identical in functionalitybytecode afaik
341647,hi sers what are the top money markets on solana is there any good competitor to solend doing innovative stuff
341648,hey lobsters are there any nft platform without fees or royalties
341649,hi is anybody here using aiml in their blockchain applications what kind of challenges are you facing we are planning to launch a move2earn web3 app which uses computer vision algorithms for tracking and want to know if we need to train and run our ai algorithms in a decentralised way
341650,hi lobsters please let me know about zapper project is that project have good potential in upcoming days more than 1 year is passed but still they didnt launch their mainnet
341651,hi read in messari article aboud stakinkg derivatives that eth derivatives currently represent originally staked eth plus all earned staking rewards since december 2020 ankreth projects this underlying value at currently 1 ankreth 1051 eth is it true for steth from lido so the real price of steth should be more than 1 eth
341652,no steth rebasing its balance every day
341653,got it thx
341654,so total supply of steth represents number of staked eth rewards
341656,subgraphs sound like a good option but would need subgraphs for every protocol that any adrress may have used my main concern is maintainability especially since this is a personal project without a team
341657,francium is novel and has competitive lending rates
341658,
341659,ive heard of neptune wonder how theyll do
341660,isnt there tulip as well
341661,sudoswap its otc tho
341662,any solutions with either argent or gnosis safe or combining them so that my dad can grant my hardware access for 1 hour to shift funds around for him for example he has a gnosis safe and i am one of his keys but can he grant full access for me to work for 1hr then access is removed automatically i believe argent has flavors of this functionality but not really for someone else to control the wallet obviously this is only useful when you fully trust the other person
341664,couldnt he just update gnosis to accept only one sig and then change it back
341665,well he is 75 years old and doesnt know how to use a computer that is why maybe getting him on argent on his mobile he can confirm a message thats about all i think i can get out of him if argent can be a signer on a gnosis wallet that might be what i am looking for
341666,can this be done from his mobile he does have the ledger x but personally ive never tested with blue tooth he could prob usb otg tho can that function be called with ledger and gnosis safe on his phone
341667,have you tried the gnosis mobile app itself
341668,downloaded it awhile ago but it didnt have l2 support and bailed away from it
341669,on gnosis you can set an allowance to a given account no way to expire it automatically thoughas far as i know
341670,yeah you need a separate gnosis on each chain afaik
341671,im looking for a leading insurance protocol firm looking to engage to insure smart contracts risks linked to stablecoin dex amm usage connected w etherisc and nexus mutual at ams seemed a great start anyone from research whos got a few projects in mind happy to hear about it
341673,will it ever be technically possible to have smart contract wallets but cross chain functionally or at least ethrollups but dont need one deployed on each rollup
341674,anyone have idea how i can check how many holders are signatories to a multisig
341675,if its on gnosis you can open the multisig on their website and click on the signers under settings
341676,for rollups its technically possible and already done actually you can atomically send l1l2 messages and viceversa its up to each protocol to decide what those messages should be or dofor actual crosschain should be more difficult since you dont have atomic security there
341677,i know of at least starkgate if you want to check actual code an erc20erc721 bridge to starknet
341678,yeah cross chain isnt that important good to know it could be easier for eth to rollups
341679,i have been using orbitor what is the difference with stargate
341680,isnt that the one for zksync
341681,should be pretty much the same idea just not compatible since starknet is not evm
341682,am i the only one
341683,i just got it too
341684,i got one as well
341685,fishy indeed i got it though i never used opensea apart from connecting wallet
341686,yeah it is can i dm
341687,just received one as wellfrom probably scamdont remember providing any email to them
341688,you guys have emails in the hardware wallet breach great list to phish from
341689,im not touching the link provided never do with crypto stuff
341690,unfortunately it was also a personal one i didnt think to use a burner lessons learned kek
341691,i dont but i bought a hardware wallet after the breach
341692,maybe its still available to public lol
341693,sure
341694,have you checked if its really from opensea remember that that field can be faked
341695,its certainly not from opensea the issue is how the scammers got the email addresses in the first place
341696,hey what are some good faucets to get testnet eth my google seems to indicate that even getting 1 full eth on a testnet is hard hardly anyone gives above 3 if you dont have socials even with socials its 1
341697,try this one faucetparadigmxyz
341698,yeah the best you can do is distribute risk though under that setup i doubt theres any financial incentive thatll be sufficient when push comes to shove
341699,needs twitter with 15 followers
341700,wait wtf youre saying i shouldnt have replied w my pvt key to get opensea airdrop
341701,unslashed
341702,hi through researching alternative chains and their ecosystems i tried to find main drivers for tvl and ecosystems growth for me it looks like 1 first dex 2 first lending 3 convenient bridges 4 hyping nft collection 5 mb also local stablecoins are necessary elements of defilego andor could be drivers for rapid tvlgrowth also ecosystems representation matters this could be achieved with powerful patrons ftx for solana do kwon for terra andor strong marketingtop vcs aurora in the same time i see algorand which has dex yep it was hacked but its kind of common thing in defi lending nftmarkets vcs and it has only 150 mln tvlso do you think its possible to formalize a drivers which could lead to rapid tvls growth and what algorands problem is do they just missed few parts of mosaic which can be easily fixed eg more bridges a bit of marketing and tvl will explode or their problems are deeper
341703,1 vcs2 everything else
341704,yeah but until then it would work out similar to how its working already for liquity
341705,came across an extremely clever scam on discord scammers even managed to get the same xxxx number after the username

341707,notice the letter nbe careful out there

341713,afaik steth rebases thats why
341715,
341716,correct and theres a wrapped version of steth wsteth which functions like reth does
341717,

341722,hey guys can you all help me in a little community feedback sort of basically i am a designer and have received an assignment sort of from an cybersecurity company to design a good leaderboard for them for displaying the audits they have donewhile i have seen some of the competitors they said they want something completely fresh and unique which no one has done yet so i am not much familiar with the tech in blockchain thats why have came for community feedback here like how would you like a leaderboard to be designed please give any number of pointers you can it will really help me a lotthank you so much
341723,hi first of all check out the most competitive auditor list wwwdefisafetycomauditors just to be sure3 maybe a bit of gamification wont hurt the project dont you think like make this leaderboard fully interactive or idk there is an interesting story in the military and space forces to issue a special chevron for each significant successful military operation you could make one commemorative chevron for each of your listings and sell it as a nft why notexample _media3aastp_patchpnginsigniaappreciate more ideas from the community3

341757,any projects apart from lemma doing that btw
341758,just read your thread farm42 loved it
341759,thank you here you can track all my activities sir startmepqrg5adofficercia
341760,hey where can i get bigger version of it
341761,see xml file in this repo then upload it to drawio githubcomoffcierciadefideveloperroadmap
341762,rysk are building something like this not basis trading nor delta neutral but rather uncorrelated returns
341763,thanks
341764,is there any released or unreleased chains that do anything different from the normthey all promote faster and cheaper
341765,hi guys we are spanning labs a team of mit and georgia tech graduates with years of software dev experience at zoox and spacex we are surveying smart contract development preferences if you were a developer please fill out the survey below include potential incentives and your answer could benefit you in the future also please feel free to follow us on social media invitation link in the survey
341766,link doesnt works or its just me
341767,anyone here based in zurich zug
341768,zh ser
341769,try this
341770,organising a meet up next week
341771,nice whereabouts
341772,the ageold conundrum sir a tale as old as time
341773,there is mina i dunno if it is doing stuff differently but it is claiming to do stuff differently
341774,celestia and fuel too
341775,dfinity a fork that is decentralized would be interesting to see or dead
341776,this is actually a pretty dope idea
341777,but there are many layers of centralisation to dfinity first the compute requirements then how you access the compute you can just spin up these data centres you need to use difnity approved data centres and be kycd into them
341778,yeah you have to wonder if its viable when you get rid of all the centralization
341779,you have to wonder if it is viable
341780,probably is if they market their way around everything lol
341781,ser i do believe they try precisely to deploy a delta neutral strategy through basis trading the difference is they call it dynamic hedging but it sounds and looks like basis trading to my dumb ass tbh dynamic delta hedging is an options trading strategy that aims to reduce the directional risk associated with price movements in the underlying asset this can be done by selling or purchasing options of the underlying asset and purchasing an amount of the underlying asset other options or even futures to ensure that the delta of the portfolio is 0 the investor aims to reach a delta neutral state from their docs theres nobody from the team in da house would be could if they could post an explainer with the difference or if mgavaudan could explain the difference to smol brains like myself
341782,well on lemmas part i know the strategy is not primarily options based but rather perps based
341783,so they are taking a direction on the perp to earn funding then hedging with spot to put in most simple terms possible
341784,whereas rysk is a strat built on options
341785,lobster daily 392 daily recap 24 april1 tips for researches smart use of search engineslink link to discussion 2 simple staking smart contracts to study link to discussion 3 first unofficial 10b57e6da0 meetuplobsgang link link to discussion 4 any solutions to grant temporary access to the hardware with argent or gnosislink to discussion 5 building a solution to track hisorical balances for an addresslink to discussion
341786,basis trading in defi is primarily based on carrying an equal amount of spot and perp contracts with the aim of the delta of these assets cancelling out theyre both delta 1 or 1 and the aim should be that ur collecting the perp funding rate basically risk free theres no need to rebalance except for managing ur margin the portfolio because the delta of spot and futures dont changeas mgavaudan will attest basis trading doesnt scale that well as a defi protocol unfortunately until you can do on chain perp rate arbitrage even this could be hard because its sort of pvp in tradfi i think basis trading could be with options idk for sure from what ive seen basis trading can be from any derivative but defi typically defines everything differently so i would say basis trading is the first definition above in defi
341787,what were building at rysk uses options primarily we also use perps and spot to manage delta and you could say our yield comes from harvesting volatility or gamma depending on how you want to look at it for some reason reply guys dont think volatility can be mispriced lol something about alabeda making markets ultra efficient and time decay where delta comes in is our pool prices to incentivise purchase of derivatives that move delta back to 0 so whilst the pool aims for delta 0 its just a dream because the delta of an option changes which is why the hedge needs to be dynamic why we say uncorrelated instead of delta neutral unlike basis trading which is a static hedge
341788,dynamic hedging is just delta hedging as spot moves
341789,theoretically if you hedge your options delta perfectly and continuously and realized vol is the same as the implied vol when the options were purchased u would break even
341790,or volatility or time
341791,yes
341792,such brain much wow
341793,internet computer and their canisters reminds a bit holochains dna and zomes a bit icp is way more user and developer friendly tho
341794,does solidly support curve 3 token pools
341795,yea you are taking a position on vol here basically
341796,solidly for stable pools uses curve kx3yy3x otherwise kxy only bitoken pools
341797,how hard to add 3 pool relatively speaking to the available pools support
341799,to add on current solidly implementation afaik impossible as pool deployer is immutable
341800,what would have been involved in adding 3pools was it hard to do wondering why it wasnt included
341801,why isnt balancer nearly as successful as curve tho it seems to be a superset functionality of curve
341802,higher slippage traders will always prefer curv
341803,why isnt balancer doing as well as so many basic uniswap v2 dexs either its superset of those with same or less slippage
341804,uniswap has a competitive advantage of a wellknown ui people go to which routes to the uniswap pools that case when marketing works balancer ui has been very unusable back in the day good now i guesscurve has a competitive advantage of very well spinned up sustainable governancesubsidy system which can pupm up any important pool and it was earlier with stableswap crypto pools are also performing somewhat better than constantproduct or alike
341805,advantage of uniswap ui being well marketed is fairly big when it was just uniswap2 usdtusdc pool was making quite good apy even with constantproduct invariant consistently getting traders rekt
341806,crypto pools are also performing somewhat betteryou mean curve pools or what crypto
341807,curve crypto pools v2 eg tricrypto crveth
341808,balancer implements stablecoin algo for stablecoin pools now
341809,but clones and alternatives were expected so token economics on curve is something which protects the moat there rather than some intellectual property things or whatever
341810,what part protects the moat well the 4y lock convex sort of translated that into a 16 week lock
341811,not the lock no
341812,the feedback loop feesdao emissionsusers
341813,does solidly just alter the uni code formula or fork the curve pools code for that
341814,for stablecoin pools solidly uses some special formula which has no adjustable parameters and has infinite liquidity density in the middle i think
341815,solidly basev1pair contract literally goes likeif pool is stable use x3yy3xotherwise use xyand the stable flag is set on pool creation
341816,heh
341817,whats the curve 3 stable pool mathalgo boil down to
341818,well same as for any number of coins stableswap invariant
341819,does curve have any oss code for basic ui to runtest its 3 pool contracts
341820,led zeppelin
341821,brahma finance
341822,why didnt solidly based itself on curve with 3 pools support and just adjust the formula for kxy for volatile pools if it wanted nice curve math explainer
341823,curve has an advantage because its a defined market stables as opposed to every token ever uniswap
341824,idk i think andre wanted to experiment a bit
341825,seems to be doing better than many with volatile pairs too those which are supported
341826,embrace extend extinguish
341827,heh
341828,maybe just more work to fork curve than uniswap
341829,well i mean
341830,try saddle finance
341831,codebase isnt everything
341832,curve and uniswap have an aesthetic distinct
341833,he could have used the stableswap invariant but he really wanted to figure on his own pretty nice experiment i must say
341834,balancer does not
341835,can you summarizeelaborate why
341836,no
341837,what do you like about the experiment
341838,teach a man to fish etc
341839,i like that this bonding curve is not parametrized and becoming more and more dense as stablecoin stabilizes
341840,especially the latter
341841,pretty interesting
341842,you mean you like this formula x3yy3x
341843,wen procedural liquidity provisioning ser
341844,but its too bad he didnt support 3 stable pools why do you think he didnt bother supporting them theyre a big deal
341845,dont forget bancorv3 soon
341846,looks interesting
341848,hahalove me some scroobius
341849,especially with a nice shimano reel
341850,bancor v3 is innovative like it was with the first amm omnipools is a trip just 1 big pool of all the tokens thereby i guess also allowing unlimited 1sided il free staking of infinity pools with the il even paid for by the 3rd party tokens and autocompounding rewards wheres oss ui code tho
341851,the blog doesnt yet explain how omnipools infinity pools set their prices though i can guess will be revealed later
341852,possibly dumb q but who pays for the metamask infura rpc is it free to use for everyone
341853,legally speaking ofc i know i can just go use the endpoint without permission
341854,id guess omnipool gets prices from the regular pools
341855,your data pays
341856,
341857,vpn can just bypass why the bites the dust
341859,a vpn does nothing to change 0xbad banned user
341861,so move funds to another wallet a bit of a hassle but not that much
341862,you should read the screenshot
341863,i did how does it prevent you from withdraw move funds and use from a new wallet maybe i need a coffee
341864,indeed
341865,decentralized finance
341866,heh well this will hardly be the hardest blow the system will hit back with buckle up
341867,yeah well see funny how defi platform devs think that they can appease euus
341868,i think we should normalize geoblocking based on ip but only on the front endsits enough to trick the normies is not so difficult to overcome via alt uisinteract directly
341869,when they really cannot as euus will go after crypto anyway to prevent escape from their depreciating shitcoins
341870,can you elaborate on why we cant withdraw then move funds to another wallet then use vpn then use the app
341871,ser did you see anyone make that point
341872,its easier to be a tough guy when its not your ass thats gonna go to jail if you dont respect regulations
341873,i mean its a moderately interesting tangent for sure but meh
341874,indeed what sir
341875,well now i kind of get why bitcoinmonero are developed by anons
341876,you can withdraw and move funds to another wallet as i said
341877,learning to interact with the blockchain without relying on frontends is a good thing anyways will drive more decentralization at all levels
341878,lol it really is all fun and games until insert fbi open up meme
341879,the regulatoor
341880,interesting theyre going after transfers within though thats new
341881,yea frontend is ok but this is on chain banningrestricting of some kind right
341882,yup
341883,full spec is here its quite detailed but the part you want is under trading and fees
341884,technically not the first time
341885,it is 2025 and all your 10 dappchainsubnet validators are required to ban bad addresses
341886,
341887,the feels
341888,
341889,
341890,bad news ever my airdrop
341891,ah damn
341892,didnt see that one coming
341893,this is the empire strikes back of the nft marketplace wars
341894,btw
341895,
341896,smart of opensea to kill this potential competition early
341897,can these guys not get hacked for just 1 day what is going on with the whole teamcommunity lol
341899,i honestly wonder if its the same scammer or if the scammer owns one or two and is interacting with the contract to look legit
341900,you know like with shitcoins where the devs allow for buyssells for a short period prior to turning off sells and rugging
341901,theyre nft not security experts
341902,
341903,you are giving bayc holders a lot of credit to assume they know how to check a contract t see if others are interacting
341904,thats fair
341905,do they even know what etherscan is debatable
341906,rude
341907,is it normal for me to be worried about gems roadmap now i know theyre saying it wont change but so did keybase
341908,when they were acquired by zoom
341909,why is liquidity so low on the sorted list at bottom
341910,i think you should assume it will get rugged to maintain opensea dominance usually how this stuff works
341911,yes
341912,looks like elon has acquired twitter
341913,yay
341914,on the bright side i suppose vasa can take the money make an anon account and just build it over again
341915,
341916,caution it looks like bayc instagram was hacked
341917,please be safe everyone dont click any links you dont 100 trust
341918,well good bye to nfts as pfp
341919,true bear market
341920,doge integration incoming
341921,
341922,damn
341923,are you guys mirroring your github repos somewhere else btw
341924,we did discuss moving to russian git providers like gitflic
341925,im personally looking forward to radicle when they fix their ux
341926,adding lftherios from radicle here
341927,why so
341928,have you tried
341929,mailing list feature is one i wish github had
341930,it looks like shit how is it better than github
341931,you can run the entire stack on your own hardware
341932,well gitlab in that case
341933,idk about better it certainly is more git like than github
341934,there is also sourcegraphcom
341935,absolutely no tracking or advertising all features work without javascript
341936,means you could use tor without issue
341937,out of the frying pan into the fire
341938,inshallah
341939,i mean selfhosted is an option yes
341940,but i dont think anyone of us wants to do devops
341941,if its not us hosting then neither sourcehut nor sourcegraph are a better option bc they are run by enemy nationstates
341942,
341943,the only real way forward for international collab is web3 imo
341944,this seems interesting i wonder how they deal with state bloat
341945,if mot this then backdoors etc
341946,when ntp geolocation restrictions
341947,yeah that would be fun
341948,
341949,have any projects considered paying team members dao contributors in fpi or a salary tied to the fpi price
341950,doesnt necessarily mean hes gonna kill it just means hes gonna focus resources getting spam uner control which will be much more beneficial for crypto than nft pfps imo
341951,ability to have a decentralized pos network that you dont have to maintain yourselfachieve decentralization and high security from day one with staking from professional validatorsthe launch process is orchestrated through a series of smart contracts to which professional validators need to stake and the generation of the genesis block to start this orchestration process please apply through theformand tell us more about your project and usecasethe process of finding the validators for your network is facilitated by polygon from the pool of existing polygon mainnet validators once the needed number of validator is coordinated the staking process can start and your polygon supernet is up and runningone of these is not like the rest
341952,this new era of trustworthy professional validators is nice
341953,why would you do this
341954,does anyone know a bridgeget gas for the milky way ada chain plz no bully i already controlfd and all that came up was stuff about milking
341955,yeah that would be what you expect but elon is like personification of never let them know your next move meme just saying i wont be surprised if he did decide to roll back nfts but tbh i think he will push for dogecoin integration more
341956,barn_raise_v5pdf
341957,thoughts
341958,little late to the conversation but what hokage_doge amplice and jib0xd said is correctrysks product is different from basis trading because 1 it is a dynamic hedge they readjust their delta exposure continuously basis trading is always more or less delta 0 and 2 they use options etc whereas we focus on spot perpscurrently basis trading on derivs protocol is not very scalable because it is not super easy to arbitrage across deriv cexes and dexes its also why were coming out with lemma v2 very soon
341959,
341960,ser i am still 1500 in line pls fix this asap
341961,lemma v2 will hopefully accomodate everyone on the waitlist haha
341962,europes regulatory measures need to go further we need to focus more on unbacked cryptoasset activities that are undertaken without service providers in addition we cannot afford to leave onchain peertopeer payments unregulated as they can be used to circumvent any regulation
341963,any speculations on how much was gem acq hint hint vasa
341964,when adequately regulated and supervised stablecoins are nothing more than emoney arrangementsrare honesty
341965,nft ppl dont even like that dont think it changes anything either way this chat is for nft avenue
341966,good visualization of stablecoin reserves
341970,
341971,nothing special but ok read
341973,automatically adjust salaries to keep up with cpi
341974,i think you are right about patronsno patrons almost no one talks about algorandfrom users perspective its hard to find the reasons to use algorandfrom developers perspective its hard to build with teal
341975,algorand looks like some state coin by the founders involved
341976,algorand is the hashtag blockchain of blockchains
341977,all run out of one office building in boston
341979,two europeans tied to north koreas crypto conference charged by us prosecutors
341980,
341981,nan
341982,nan
341983,intern fired soon
341984,haha
341985,did he actually say ngmi to cobie
341986,can anyone recommend a dapp for recurring crypto payments i know there will be loop but arent there available alternatives
341987,did you try twittercomllamapay_io
341988,twittercomofficer_ciastatus1503755619832053760 there are also several competitors mentioned in replies like superfluid
341989,airdrops today is a meaningless falling knife every new project keep catching over and over again literally 0 chance to make it and keep everyone happy
341990,it is good advertising if done properly
341991,depends on how you define recurrent payments could be sablier superfluid request etc i think there was a eip trying to create some mechanism for monthly payments similar to how traditional saas works back in 2019 but i dont think they ever made any progress
341992,curve dev contributed to this hope it picks up a bit of traction
341993,for the cost of airdrop you can literally put up your ads on half of the internet
341994,i mean you are entitled to your own theory but i doubt 1inch dydx looksrare would be as big as they are now if they just placed normal ads
341995,say what you want about the tokens value but yeah
341996,its not about making everyone happy its about trying to reach to an audience in the most engaging way
341997,dripsnetwork
341998,you just need to really put safeguards in place imho airdrops without any vesting
341999,bset safeguard is pmf amirite
342000,hey does anyone know anyone that handles osmosis algos yet on cosmos may be the future
342001,i dont think that would mean no dump what about cow airdrop
342002,im hodling them cow
342003,and thats a separate issue
342004,its not live yet we are looking into using it
342005,it would be cool if the streams also had an optional identifier
342006,that batteryrip friend
342009,dump your dex guru nfts asap sers
342010,airdrops did a lot to build engagement and community until ribbon airdrop still dydx and ens have shown they can still be done well while paraswap showed how not to airdrop
342011,the airdrop isnt the issue its who gets them thats the issue
342012,i love free money falling from the sky as well but it doesnt build meaningful community at all nowadays
342013,xyz fiatdao all doing year long vesting schedules for airdrops
342014,another way to do it
342015,yeah it was cool for the first time with uni it was cool maybe a couple of times after but then wrong incentives bring us 1000s of people who started sybilattacking protocols that were live on mainnet hoping for an airdrop
342016,also if you are jsut letting ppl fake engage with hi nice to be here for like 2 weeks i dont think its the airdrop that rekt your community
342017,superduperpruning
342018,how the erc721 and meta structures go are providing the economy in the evm a lot of fuel for inguinity agreed
342019,nft bros very good at burning my eth too d
342020,our eth
342021,if there were a fantastic four for crypto protocols opensea is definitely human torch
342022,theres no perfect choice even uniswap airdrop i got a friend with 2k addresses qualified and then financially freedom i just spent hours to read all the endless debates in the guru discord and found they all meaningless actually
342024,hi anysource for checking dev activity or dev score in many chains
342026,santiment has this to some extent but best go with electric capitals report
342027,hey frens is there any chance to get an answer back from the opensea team trying to reach them out about the rate limit question for our app but zero response in a while
342028,
342029,start a popular nft buying platform
342030,theyll reach out asap
342031,interesting i think most guru nfts are in the hand of couple of farmers controlling the dao
342032,there are chains with probably 1000s addys
342033,noice advice thanks gone building gemxyz alternative
342034,thatll be 1 of equity thx
342035,anyone know the reason why the listing and offer price is matched but this does not close both have not been expired yet
342036,no one wants to pay for the gas
342037,i wonder if this is a os feature or something else
342038,anyone know a site that you input an address and it shows graphically the transaction flows to other addresses i used it a while back but cant remember the name of it
342039,yes
342040,breadcrumbs
342041,
342042,thats the one thanks
342043,i also tried this one which shows tabular form thanks

342045,hey guys anyone using any defi portfolio trackers could you let me know if theyre any good here
342046,i actually looked at all the entries in this github but missed breadcrumbs haha

342049,hey guys can you all help me in a little community feedback sort of basically i am a designer and have received an assignment sort of from an cybersecurity company to design a good leaderboard for them for displaying the audits they have donewhile i have seen some of the competitors they said they want something completely fresh and unique which no one has done yet so i am not much familiar with the tech in blockchain thats why have came for community feedback here like how would you like a leaderboard to be designed please give any number of pointers you can it will really help me a lotthank you so much
342050,whats the best way to consolelog a memory allocated array
342051,apeboard is actually pretty good if youre heavily multichain debank is worth looking at too
342052,yeah i mean debank zerion and apeboard was mentioned in a form already so that collected only less known services

342056,hey theredoes anyone know some freelance platforms to find projects in web3
342057,try lobtsers hr ad daily apr hr
342058,use hardhat or foundry to consolelog it not sure about hard hat but you need to import the consolesol file into your tests in foundry
342060,hi there does anyone have contact for agency that moderates telegram and discord server your help is much appreciated
342062,can try
342063,if u dont interact w community urself u r a dick ngl
342064,we do interact with our community were looking to hire more due to timezone differences and we need to make sure assistance is there 247 hope this clarifies
342066,take community members you already have who are active and are known in the community and upgrade them into mods gib rewards etc best hr
342067,community volunteers are a good way to develop engagement with your community

342095,not yet passed gov needs to approve it we also had elections on sunday so we need to wait for the new gov but yes its quite crypto friendly much more than first proposals
342096,was just having a thought as another attack using mev would it be possible that when someone broadcast the transaction to buy lets say a mutant ape that still has the ability to claim apecoins someone could frontrun that transaction maybe even flashloaning eth buy the ape claim the apecoin sell the ape to the interested buyer eventually sell some and repay the flashloan
342097,and how could a buyer protect himself in this case
342098,this was already done from nftx when apecoin launched
342099,yeah first ones there was some hidden tax thatbwas decided based on various random reason which could lead to up to 50 correct me if im wrong though
342100,no what was done there was slightly different
342101,interesting i did not know
342102,not sure if that would work the moment the frontrunner buys the ape the transaction of the original buyer should fail
342103,yeah that was my doubt
342104,i probably dont understand the scheme but why would someone frontrun buy transaction how does buy transactions make a difference in that case i believe anybody can buy all the apes that still can collect airdrop collect airdrop and return it back or am i wrong
342105,i mean for the attacher it would be free ape if he could buy the ape only when he knows that someone else bradcasted a transaction to buy that ape at the price that it is beeing sold for attacker buys it at x price claim apecoin sells it to interested buyer at x price got free ape buyer end up with the ape but no apecoin
342106,but as said i would assume that the transaction of the original buyer would fail not sure if that is the case
342107,it can only be done with lending platforms not exchanges maybe you are thinking along those lines the precondition for this kind of stuff is basically that you can return the nft within the same transaction opensea does not allow for this
342109,in this case he borrowed the apes of course good idea if you can borrow the apes and claim the tokens it is fine
342110,frontrunning someones else transaction is a different story though
342111,the only thing you can do is buy the nft before someone else there is no special angle to it you can not somehow inject yourself in the middle buy it claim and then forward it to the person you are frontrunning
342112,thanks
342113,that was exactly my question
342114,essentially even current status is that there is no tax on crypto unless you do it as a profession but there are no exact rules when you become a trader its not strictly set as to x amount of trades in y days its all decided on a casebycase and its not clear what triggers the investigation if it comes to that you have to prove you are not a trader so best of luck trying to collect all tx history new bill would simplify this a lot with a lot lower tax 5 is really cheap tbh
342115,nan
342116,so apparently us dod forbids sha256 and some ec different curve than bitcoin from their top secret systems what does this mean for crypto
342117,about to be broken
342118,yes it can become hella precedent for others 5 flat on cashout is just tax heaven basically thanks for input
342119,hey guys is there a place where i can find educational content sorted by categories when it comes to crypto aka trading blockchain history dapp politic etc for exemple
342121,hey guys an prime event in davos its happening between may 2227 would be great to include as a speaker anyone from lobsterdao research pls pm me
342122,we only send lobsterdao representatives to wef events if its in davos
342123,shouldnt the lobsterdao research committee vote on the delegates first for the community to approve
342124,you may like this esasy from the 1990s
342125,i was kidding this conversation goes to lobsterkingdom chat though
342126,so did i ser
342127,tldr
342128,1 this would be great to see
342129,encryption was once treated like nuclear weapon exports in the 1990s but marketforces ensured we evolved from there we are seeing a repeat of the same story same with platform liability
342130,awesome pls do intro w whom would be available
342131,we have a venue the whole week started putting a nice schedule would like to host a speaker perhaps we can brainstorm here on the single most exciting topic or so
342132,to address
342135,lobsters hello can someone answer me about how much does audit contract cost fromto or avg pricety
342136,depends on codebase sizecomplexity and the firms reputation can be from 25k for an audit to 250k
342137,ctrlf for some audit discussions names etc
342138,ty ser
342139,
342142,sup does anyone have a paper on the eth staking after the merge
342143,
342144,hey any crypto projects that present solidity challenges open for everyone to see
342145,im tryign to compile a list of challenges so people wanting to learn solidity can use them as stepping stones
342146,there are great ctfs and tutorials out there like capture the ether crypto zombies ethernaut
342147,and then more advanced ones perhaps the most crazy ones being the paradigm ctf challenges for the advanced users
342148,any other medium and advanced ones that come to mind
342149,i feel like there are multiple basic challenges or for starting out but there is a difficult transition from doing those to actually landing a web3 job
342150,well really knowing the background and being able to solve the paradigm ctf challenges is a very good indication to get a job in the security space of course for web3 in general there is a lot more than just solidity i am not that familiar with what people should learn on that end
342151,decentralized exchange infrastructure provider 0x labs raises 70 million
342152,sweet
342153,wen 0x token
342154,uhhhhhh
342155,its called zrx
342156,
342157,lol
342158,
342159,_
342160,just kidding love oe bad timing
342161,if they had a token this wouldve never had happened s
342162,
342163,everybody want them have token ser
342164,they are submitting batches on l1 tho
342165,the searchoooor
342166,with data so
342167,its either optimism etherscan not working or the sequencer not working
342168,you cant sell to a diff person in the normal nft marketplace model
342169,its signature based so if the seller changes the order validation fails
342170,thank you no frontrunning nfts safer place than amms
342171,any good reads on working of cpi pegged stable coins
342172,dunno about working but i think theres basically fpi and volt will release one soontm dont know about any others
342173,i think the tldr of how volt currently works is the protocol holds fei which it lends out to earn yield every month chainlink oracle delivers new cpi info which is used to update the exchange rate for mintsell if there is shortfall the protocol will cover with fei reserves in the future the gov token vcon might be used to backstop or some other method to sell the debt is used this part is less clear to me
342174,isnt this model of using gov token to cover the shortfall similar to how anchor uses anc to cover the shortfall is it sustainable
342175,also does fpi uses fpis for covering the shortfall as well or is there any other mechanism
342176,joel john on twitter been spending a while studying why opensea acquired gemxyz with the help of onchain data here are some observations twitter
342177,this guy on twitter keeps spamming charts what a nerd
342178,it does use fpis in shortfall
342179,
342180,lets say i used a script earlier this year to harvest dump half and then make lp tokensand lets say this thing did 14k transactionsi used the blockscanner to grab download all of the farming rewards used it to grab all of the add liquidity transactionsbut getting the details of how much of tokena and tokenb went into each lp is a different matterdoes anyone know of an app or have an idea on how to easily get this data
342181,covalenthq api could help but could be a manual process
342186,all accs got filtered ngmi pleb
342187,lobsters have a hierarchy
342188,in the animal kingdom
342191,friendship ended with opti now arbi is my new best friend
342192,anyone know if theres an easily way to get broad defi sector specific value capture data would love to see how average margins differ by sector
342193,
342194,was just about to ask if anyone knew of any projects on op building outside the snx umbrella
342195,how many users does snx have now
342197,how is your airdrop allocation guys
342198,almost 800
342199,but i am small fry
342200,i am seeing folks with 30k in my tl
342201,apparently only 45 addresses with 30k if you hit all 6 categories
342202,
342203,all of them r well known ct handles
342204,nan
342205,sweety ivan
342206,lobster daily 393 daily recap 25 april1 defi earning strategieslink to discussion 21 does solidly support curve 3 token poolslink to discussion 22 solidlys curve formulalink to discussion 3 dydx blocking userslink link to discussion 4 musk gets twitter for 44 billion to cheers and fears of free speech plan read link to discussion 5 contribute to the developer survey link link to discussion
342207,feel that is unfair that i got 1000 for just being a multisig signer but regular optimism users or dao voters get less
342208,i got the 12kish tier missed the multisig signer rip
342209,absolutely not drop hunters information leak and a fair userbased distributionevery decent user uses multisig nowadays for something on layer2
342210,got 254 xd not even sure if itll be worth the hassle tbf
342211,im surprised there are only 82k people who have taken part in dao governance i wonder what their scope was and how they classified dao voting
342212,idk i donated and it wasnt registered so no telling
342213,nan
342214,yeah ive bridged and it wasnt registered neither for me
342215,only or up to
342216,l1 donations only sirfucked up kinda still waiting for team to answer properly why so
342217,i am surprised there are only 2666 more people like me
342218,cause therere a lot of airdrop hunters in gitcoin zksync
342219,i know sirbut its a pity for me personallyalso team answered and that is one of the reasons
342220,the same i dont know anyone how support more than 5 projects in gr using mainnet
342221,anyone want to share their starknet airdrop strat
342222,i think these reqs are even worse than paraswap everything is just so random i had funds there for almost 3 months but did not get the 4 week one because i only compounded once
342223,didnt even filter farmers too xd
342224,u will get some in the next rounds i guesstheir discord is on fire now
342225,actually they considered even if you did 23 times
342226,they will have total 34 airdrop as per their documents 2 inflationary model is also big question
342227,not very hopeful of those the reqs will probably get even more random
342228,what do you mean to prepare for an eventual drop such as the op one
342229,i think other than engaging as a developer or maybe discussing mechanics in the forum stuff such as fee structures are being discussed openly right now
342230,theres little else to do there right now
342231,are there any good resources to understand the dark forest game
342232,the three body problem
342233,lol i actually meant how they are utilizing zero knowledge just to understand a bit better about the application of zkproofs in eth

342235,thank you for this
342236,awesome
342237,quick note the first arxiv paper i think relates to the paradigm blog post about mev bots rather than the game
342238,thx thats how githubcomtasospysearchenginesscraper works my mistake
342239,oh awesome thats a nifty tool
342241,
342242,on it
342243,new york assembly passes twoyear crypto mining moratorium bill link
342244,
342245,hey ive made a quick guide on how to position yourself for the future rounds of optimism
342246,hope it helps you guys
342247,gud thread
342248,
342249,i dont received the airdrop i could receive another
342250,how many coins did people get per wallet
342253,their article is quite clear
342254,
342255,quite some saltiness about this op airdrop is it a pure degen airdrop or well thought out
342256,given how hard it is to make airdrop nowadays with all cheatersbots i feel like op has done quite well and the criteria are simple to read
342258,i dont get all the salty may be because those cheaters cant get any
342259,its enough with me and its good for opti eco
342260,people will need op token for the next airdrop
342261,boostrap liquidity and healthy growth
342262,the bot only prove the broke of free mode
342263,whcih bot
342264,
342265,
342266,it claimed 10303 nft and ranks no 1
342267,pitch fork time
342268,another ponzi token yay
342269,fml
342270,why would it claim that many
342271,making a criteria when you know that only 64 or 46 we addresses will have the benefits is fishy to say the least and just bad pr with no upside
342272,wait isnt that just the nft from the mirror article
342273,not sure what all the rage is seems like a weird thing to bot in the first place
342274,10303 is not that high for the actual op drop too there are people posting screenshots of 30k
342275,should be around 45 addresses 250k eligible addresses with something like that
342276,people expect next airdrop will include the nft holder but sitll cannt explain why a bot claim so many
342277,it definitely wont now lol
342278,initial supply is around 12 billion and max is around 43 billion
342279,ah thats weird the modal was reading that it was sold out for me before was that a glitch
342280,minted out
342281,this thread is very nice
342282,again thats the token wasnt the etherscan link above for the nft
342283,lol you guys are talking different things
342284,you pay almost same transaction fee minting 1 or 10k just need to make sure not hitting gas limit
342285,ppl who sybilled are salty
342286,sybilling meta died with the ribbon airdrop divergence squeezed too much juice out of that watermelon
342288,lol
342289,does someone have an idea how to pack an ecdsa signature
342290,2xbytes32
342291,want to stuff some more infos in
342292,
342293,do you mean something like this
342294,hmmm thx
342295,its going in the right direction
342296,but i need more like to stuff more info in it
342297,some encodingdecoding scheme
342298,kind of probabilistic encodingdecoding
342299,to get in rsv in xx of cases an additional byte32 somehow
342300,thank you
342301,
342302,omnichain wallet
342303,anyone has the full interview
342305,hey this isnt passed yet
342306,our government just changed so i would wait on this
342307,sure
342309,mixer
342311,i think kucoin should work they have lenient policy
342312,minor but not talking about the amount in a public chat is a good first step
342315,evmos relaunched and their airdrop goes live at 6pm utc i believe
342316,these guys
342317,any link
342318,not on hand will see if i can find it in the evmos chat
342321,
342322,you mean resumed the chain
342323,seems im mistaken chain relaunches today but airdrop on 29th still confirming
342324,yes apologies for the mixup
342326,okayy thx
342327,would urge every project to run transparent botcutter program we did it w gearbox and it saved a lot didnt touch regular users
342328,
342329,i have to say gearboxs bot detection is the best ive ever seen
342330,
342331,botcutting tool with private biometrics is urgently needed
342332,please put ur eye scanner to where it came from
342333,you are holding it in your hand
342334,does anyone know a tool to analyze pnl of addresses for a specific token address in a dex maybe someone has done a project or a table on dune analytics cannot find it
342335,zerion
342336,or do you mean pnl by holder from token side that i dont think is readily available
342337,would be pretty cool
342338,sorry for the offtopic but theres some weird typo on my water filter an a instead of e for some reason
342339,you can use a library like this to get historical holdingsevents for an address and dex trades for pricing for supported protocols
342340,mellow has something very similar on what u ask u can ask alexeuler for more details
342341,cool didnt know about this one
342342,does anyone here understand the taro from lightning labs if tarobased stable coins are issued in lightning channels how are the token emissions etc basic smart contract stuff handled are total supply etc defined somewhere and how are thise tokens released to the network i couldnt understand any of it by the blog post
342343,
342344,gonna be the old grandpa in the room but i honestly was very disappointed with the presentations yesterdaythere were a few factually incorrect things said during them there was one project that im pretty had no business needing a blockchain at all but had a contract for shits and giggles and a couple other that glossed over important facts in order to present something shiny
342345,i get that its a hackathon and some of that is bound to happen fair
342346,but i was expecting some more experienced devs in the room to actually come up with stuff that would move the ecosystem forward
342347,that lightning network thing sounds great though but didnt reach the presentations
342348,there was some paid service about 89 month ago but it didnt work perfect not sure if it still works
342349,eg claiming that l2 messaging solves the gas costs on an l1 gnosis safe and you can now interact with a vault for free when in fact someone still needs to trigger an l1 tx to actually consume the messages and execute all the logic
342350,who is working on crosschain yield aggregators would be great to brainstorm on architecture designs
342351,yearn so far had adhoc deployments w fantom true deplyment and tesseract on polygon
342352,would love to hear ur thoughts on how to so we can integrate ur contract into gearbox potentially
342353,maybe sjoerd rob have smth to share on this no shilling blz tho
342355,so cool
342356,hey was there a discussion here about the flow token bull case im trying to understand why would anyone hold the token marketplaces fees are split between dapper labs and the sport league or whatever token holders dont benefit from it at all and flow token doesnt seem to accrue much value from the network usage
342358,
342359,for future use
342360,can we get a wen in the chat boys
342361,second raise in the books
342362,peter thiel has lost his touch as of late
342363,he invested in eos last year
342364,whatever happened to bullish exchange
342365,best case same thing that happened to eosfinex
342366,he is a whale his fund invested btc in 2012 if im not wrong he is an angel investor of eth too
342367,as of late was the keyword
342368,taken from bullishcom the trading pairs
342369,
342370,is it even possible to do this safely across l1s
342371,seems like its hard enough already to build a safe bridge across l1s something as complicated as yields seems like its just asking to be exploited over and over foreveri mean in a decentralized way obviously you could just have some crazy web of multisigs or sth
342373,he didnt get the memo
342374,ever had issues calculating realtime apr as a liquidity provider on uniswap this should help
342375,i think doesnt have all hacked eventsfor example onering platform hack is not there
342376,see
342377,
342378,thanks
342379,actually full of dogshit
342380,
342381,dogshit
342382,nan
342383,why usd but not ust
342384,not sure if joking or serious but that is usd the fiat not usdc the fiatcoin
342385,wow thats a lot of holdings in pow companies xd
342386,but muh energy consumption sir
342387,andre
342388,black rock has ton of experts in green washing itll all be fine
342389,no way he went on a podcast
342390,hes gone on podcasts before ser
342391,i meant now anyway will listen to the current one
342392,build gerabox we are waiting for airdrop
342393,christ he wasnt just larping
342394,i really wish id been wrong
342396,he didnt realise this since eminence finance
342403,if you dont want me at my worst you wont get the best of me
342404,banteg literally drove the guy away from his child single handedly poor fella
342407,yes we are thanks for pointing this out ivangbi in a nutshell we are implementing an actively managed by the community etflike yield aggregator that will give users exposure on yield from multiple chains but yes itll be great to do some brainstorming indeed
342408,you can dm me for a more in depth discussion
342409,hey yall im looking for a smart contract that allows address with specific nfts to register ens subdomain like specific gated wallets can control their own subdomain
342410,anyone buying this psyop
342411,just some light shitposting not sure there is much to discuss or even send
342412,isnt that basically the shillbottery elon was complaining about
342413,
342414,why am i still making 5 on my stables apeir99n windrathio why rug
342415,
342416,banger
342417,q i recently started selling nfts and now i want to convert some of the moneys to fiat but i cant sent it to my exchange accounts cuz then it will connect my personal wallets which i prefer to keep secret with nft wallets which are public is there a good way to pull this off
342418,you make another exchange account then thats not illegal or shady
342419,you can try out this
342420,freshly simulated for you ser
342421,rug potential 0 or more
342422,tell me where i can get a 0 risk in crypto and ill go all in
342423,to be fair here the risk is only on the contract side whether apy goes up or down it doesnt matter as long as youve secured your pt its a right to claim the exact same amount of usdc at the end of the period in 54 days
342424,anyone at ftx conference who want to be shilled zksync
342426,is just made to collect clicks nothing new about snowden
342427,bill clinton edition
342428,anyones has note on this
342429,just listen to it lol go for a nice walk
342430,
342431,the attack lasting less than 15 seconds targeted a cloudflare customer on the professional pro plan operating a crypto launchpad
342435,damn i still remember when they launched at first along with some other competitor who never made it big fan personally and professionally
342436,bunch of new features dropping
342437,cf right im a big fan too great productlong article but captivating story about the cofounder of cloudflare
342439,the nomad bridge floodgates are open to evmos go degen lobsters
342440,which network are you on can recommend one for multisig on eth polygon arbitrum
342441,heartbreaking
342443,all bridges are a relic of the past layerzero will swallow all this direction watch for projects on this protocol there will be the biggest drops as probably in zks
342444,hi guys for alpha hunters we are secretly launching a tool to discover early projects please check
342445,some things are absolutely unclear by what criteria they are searched and ranked is there an article or manual with explanations
342447,we will publish an article explaining scoring methods in future
342449,w w8
342450,you can follow for our future updates
342451,lol nomad isnt a bridge its a general message passing protocol they just letting l0 create the bottoms up market and then nomads security model will reign superior
342452,q for a friend is there much demand for ex bankers transactional banking in crypto and where would be the best place to begin looking
342453,yes depending on skill set just get involved with defi protocols you find interesting
342454,thanks could you elaborate depending on skill set
342455,whatever experience you have see if someones making a crypto version of it
342456,that was my initial thought as well although im not active in seekinghiring so wasnt sure
342457,diffusionfi airdrop is live on evmos just claimed mine can confirm it works rpc url chain id 9001criteria1 users who had more than 400 uni on december 31st 2021 but less than 10k unior2 users who burned more than 1eth in gas or less than or equal to 50eth interacting with uniswap before 31st december 2021
342458,how do you claim it
342459,three dots at the top right and there is a claim button
342460,

342464,hey guys is there anything like governance aggregator which aggregates governance proposals in different platforms like snapshot or tally
342465,there are so many proposals in a day that im wondering why nobody is building one tool for those governance guys lol
342466,
342467,thanks for sharing fren but boardroom is less functional as i imagine

342476,
342477,if anyone knows someone from circle exploiter still holding usdc
342478,there are some custom made platform for those who are searching jobs in web3you can give it a look at darrenlau on twitter or thedefiedgethey both have some web3 recruitment chats to hire or get hired
342481,real sad they are a passionate team and were on the right track to relaunch solidly
342482,these words from ac interview4850 are daunting
342484,some small notes from the optimism hype train
342485,the transcript of the full hour is at
342491,does anyone in here uses the block research
342492,yes
342493,yes
342495,someone is lying on the internet again
342497,engagement
342498,its not unheard of people finding guessing private keys with funds in them tho no
342499,google ethercombing
342500,yeh this the articles i was thinking of but couldnt remember the name ty ty
342501,its a private key accidentally uploaded to a public repository thats now part of a training dataset for the ai model
342502,sure my message was just to point out that a private key isnt magic and depends on the key generation
342503,its really funny that farmers in there trying to drag the conversation and spread fud that real users will be affected by this
342504,thanks for sharing i have posted updated airdrop farming evidence and a proposal to fix it not easy
342511,any articles threads on stepn tokenomics for gmtgst im interested in learning how is it different from axieslp in terms of burning and recurring sinks mechanisms
342513,there are literally thousands of wallets with unclaimed eth in them all you have to do is find them which is a hard task but once you find those unclaimed wallets youre golden
342514,is there no legal precedence for that or is it like rummaging through trash i dont want legal advice ill take an article just want to read something
342518,its unclaimed eth its all yours you just need to find the wallets with unclaimed eth technically and legally no one owns it as its unclaimed my buddy found 94 eth last year in one wallet
342519,some good otc channel to advise thx
342520,is there anyway to set state variables within a view function
342521,no thats the entire point of a view function
342522,im thinking about a library call somehow
342523,who will pay the gas
342524,caller
342525,then why use a view function
342526,when you call a view function youre not signing anything not sending any actual transaction to be mined
342527,the whole point of a view function is to query current state of blockchain without initiating a transaction
342528,hmmmm
342529,so maybe with fallback
342530,caller contracts has an interface
342531,which my contract needs to implement
342532,its a view but i want to change state of my contract
342533,but its staticcall i guess
342534,it cant be a view plain and simple
342535,that fails directly at the compilation stage even
342536,why would you want to change the state of your function in a view function
342537,caller function sends some data i want to store
342538,contract a iercmycontractviewfunctionuint xxx uint bbb
342539,need to save xxx bbb
342540,my understanding is view functions by definition do not modify state
342541,yes hmmm i think there is no way to do it
342542,honestly you should most probably look at your design and rethink it if an external interface provided something as a view function then its done to facilitate the constraint that calling that particular function will not cost gas and wont change blockchain state the whole point of an interface is that it guarantees all contracts that implements these interfaces will have the same constraints breaking that will break all other tools that maybe working on the assumption that external calls to that function is free
342543,i will try with fallback but its staticcall i guess
342544,hey sirs could you please share some easy but useful crypto tools to simplify your life like feeswtfearnifi
342545,ultrasoundmoney
342546,best way to wrap eth
342547,check out my compendium
342550,i use uniswap
342551,awesome
342552,incredible amount of work appreciate that
342553,death and taxes nice one i wonder if there is a safe mode to let the recovery instructions if i pass away
342554,this is great started already using it checking on key contacts on the insurance section guessing a sort of simple ranking would genuinely help ie github commits vintage year community
342555,eitherway genuinely appreciate the work
342556,hey all yesterday we launched something really exciting we built a way to allow users to seamlessly swap between chains without leveraging any bridges and have their trades be mev protected you all should try it out and tell us what you think
342557,
342558,yes good feedback thanks glad you like the site
342559,brilliant ty
342560,where can i find more details on how it works on the technicalities
342561,will publish a technical blog post this next week but the general outline is as follows mms manage pools on both chains that hold inventory of assets native to the chain trader requests a quote mms use this inventory to issue the quote trader submits the tx onchain one transfer happens on the source chain network of validators and relayers confirm the tx and deliver the payload to the destination chain to perform the second transfer
342562,because the pricing handled offchain via signed rfqs we can get around things like sandwich attacks and crossdomain mev cuz theres nothing to front run
342563,who is managing the mmsvalidatorsrelayers
342564,aight thank you ill look forward to the technical papers
342565,frens technical question that im not sure about if you create multiple accounts in metamask if one private key is compromised can an attacker get other pks related to that one
342566,like reverse the pk seed
342567,no
342568,iirc
342570,right but each acct still has its own
342571,i think the same but im not 100 sure
342572,if the seed phrase you got when you installed mm gets compromised its lights out for everything
342573,yeah that 100 but i dont know if you can go from a pk to the original seed
342574,
342575,if copilot can find suggest private keys then why cant gpt3
342576,one couldve achieved that by interchain messaging by chainlinks ccip or multichains anyswap and since it goes through a series of validators what the difference between that and relying on any standard bridge
342577,no
342578,theres almost no chances to revert seed from a private key but its not mathematically impossible if you have two metamask accounts generated from the same seed phrase and if you accidentally expose one accounts private key an attacker wont be able to reconstruct the wallets seed phrase and therefore the other accounts private key
342579,doesnt this add a bigger problem in that now control order flow and can trade against users similar to citadel robinhood
342581,i generally dont view that as a problem so long as the users have the choice not to take the quote if they dont like it if anything allowing mms to do the price discovery is better for the market structure after all and allows you to essentially price any asset that is not limited to spotblue chips obv there is a certain degree of centralization there around price discovery but i think its an ok trade off as long as that centralization is by choice and not being forced upon anyone via monopoly or gatekeeping
342584,obv there is a certain degree of centralizationnot that theres anything wrong with it but uh where does decentralization enter the equation in what youve described
342585,trading is completely decentralized and permissionless youre not custodying your funds with anyone and you have full control over trade submission once you receive the quote
342586,permissionless if that means its your decision to use it yeah if that means anyone can use it im curious what happens to the validatorsrelayersmms if they get a request from someone thats just exploited a protocol also noncustodial sure decentralized what does that mean here
342587,why do you need your mms to actually handle the pools why not tap into existing liq pools cross chain and settle or why need bridge period if youre matching mm rfqs wont they settle on the origin and destination chain and if they wont then you bridgeright now your pools are all stables so lets say i want to sell bnb and get eth do you have two trades and a bridge happen bnb to stable stable is moved and then stable to eth
342588,
342589,weve built the contracts to be modular with any validator sets including l0 wormhole nomad and axelar we launched the alpha with l0s oracle relayer model but planning on allowing users to chose their validator sets depending their comfort level the risk is if all these valditors and relayers and mms are compromised and collude at the same time then its an attack vector
342590,thats what we do we dont use a bridge we are only using generalized message passing to perform two trasnfersyou can swap eth to bnb right now
342591,since when can u shill in here so openly and not marketbuy at least 1 nft
342593,then why do you need pools of stables
342594,people want to trade stables theres a whole lot of users who still convert stables on various chains
342595,but they dont need to use stables as a proxy
342596,so that part doesnt flow through your mm rfq system but instead through your own swapbridge solution then
342598,nan
342599,which one the stables
342600,yes
342601,can we remove the endless stani spam please we all saw those tweets he is back we all made conclusions no need to spam this stuff over and over again
342602,nah the mms still quote stables for a tiny spread so its the same mechanic for all swaps stables to stables is not as exciting but the users still keep using it more than native or other long tail assets atleast for now
342605,why dont you verify your contracts on etherscan
342606,we will do it shortly once complete the audits which is why rn weve limited the trade sizes and tvl and kept the product in beta
342607,saw his talk during trustx few days ago still not sure if 500 a year is justified anyone sub to peter and have an opinion on how in depth it is
342608,idk what universe we are living in
342609,omgggggggggggg i am shook
342610,i thought this was a joke lol
342611,
342612,cool stuff
342613,
342614,nice fantasy though lets tokenize elons new 44bil toy and drop it to everyone like why not he has other 200bil to play with name one thing we cant web3fy tokenize and airdrop i mean it is a perfect business model for literally anything
342616,how do i sybilfarm elondrop
342617,doge tweets
342618,provocative but gets the people going
342619,44bil would top 5 marketcap
342620,nice move for gno with their proposalsburning 7m gno 70 of the total supply and funding a gnosis chain ecosystem growth initiative
342621,anyone knows the status of element governance surprised that after almost one month none has proposed making the token transferable
342622,would a proposal like that pass though
342623,hows burning tokens better for dao it benefits current token holders tho but doesnt make much sense when dao burns its own assets they could govern and spend on creating something useful
342625,wanchain partened with cardano and will serve as an evm sidechain to cardano
342626,backs into the bushes
342628,hey all ive written a guide on reading transactions with a case study of olympusdaos zapstake functionalityit will hopefully help readers use the metamask txn window to learn about the details of a transaction use etherscan to navigate through smart contract codes detect when a transaction wants to take your money
342629,evmos second try at an airdrop now called a rektdrop goes live at 1600 utc
342630,was always called rektdrop
342632,not sure if this belongs here or in nft avenue but defikingdoms has a bug not really here to get into terminology where people have been unlocking tons of locked jewel its been going on for a while
342633,apparently the devs were told in january held a governance vote but nothing was implemented
342634,do you have the technical
342635,oh right thanks for the correction i guess my memory gets fuzzy trying to go back 8 weeks
342636,would love to know your thoughts on this
342637,this is a huge issue rn tbh andre has a point about regulation
342638,i think elliptic is pretty awesome in this regard wallet screening and risk scoring without the need for kyc
342639,can see if source of funds are from known hackers
342640,the regulation maybe doesnt have to come from outside tho however it is a really hard problem to solve
342641,100 agree with you there crypto gotta learn to regulate itself traditional kyc in defi would be heartbreaking to see
342642,do we know if uniswap does any wallet screening at all like surely they must have a blacklist
342643,they now have blacklist on frontend
342644,there is always a balance with being pro regulations i think the general sentiment ismore regulations increased mass adoptionthe thing is that too often the word crypto is being associated with tax evasion but just because people dont understand the technology
342645,if you sell some stuff on a local marketplaceflee market and the money you receive is from some robberytheft does this make the money clean or tainted
342646,in my opinion the money you get in return for the sale of your asset is clean as long as the asset isnt stolen too
342649,probably a if you know or are aware of the source of funds or b if say you sell an item 10x or even 100x over market value one may argue is certainly not
342650,finally published the first part dopen to everyones feedback as to improve the scoring factors can be useful for everyoneps are there any tablesdashboards doing protocols or stables risk scoring with open models and data etcif there are none can making an mvp potentially useful for the community
342651,this is the official statement the tldr is that when you send your miner on a quest the game checks to see if you have your locked bag at the start and the end not in the middle so you send your miner on a quest one per wallet and transfer your locked bag of jewel from wallet to wallet theres a 10 chance you hit the jackpot which unlocks more jewel people have been using this bug to unlock tons of locked jewel
342652,just for reference jewel is dex on harmony their tokenomics are similar to that of bao you get some of your yield up front some of it is locked
342653,hey could anyone tell me if theres a way to check whether a signature tx is harmful or not
342654,i mean how do you know if the change you received from that lovely farmer you bought chicken with cash werent involved in terrorist attack legit concern considering blockchain is public open ledger and it should be much easier to scan and detect such things unlike how our parliaments thinks thay its easier for criminals to wash money with crypto
342655,hey lobstershas anyone researched about volt protocol fpis competitor from few substacks articles i see that theyll use pcv mechanic similar to feirari peg to usdinflation cpipeg will be provided through pcvstrategies pcv is supposed to grow faster than inflation rateso basically 1 i give my stablecoins to volts common pot in exchange for their cpipegged stablecoin 2 volt dao uses common pot in different strategies p2plending guess it will be not aave with 2 rate but more risky options lending for institutional lending mapples undercollateralized loans lol deltaneutral strategies etc 3 its supposed that daos strategies will be more profitable than cpi so pcv will overperform inflationso volt looks like an investment fund with fixed guaranteed actually not profitability but not like a stablecoin and socalled stablecoin volt looks like a tokenized right to receive part of that funds pcvif i correctly described volts mechanic i dont understand why volt is better than yearn for example by default yearn is choosing the best strategies for my stablecoins my rewards are not limited by inflation rate or other yiledprotocols plus yearn has kind of riskassesment frameworks i hope it has but we have not idea which strategies volt will use to overperform cpi inchs fuse poolsdegenboxso for me looks like theyre not making stablecoin at all
342657,so are gmx and gns true decentralized competitors of fake dydx
342661,please use ctrlf czdylan and let us know if you dont find anything
342662,ps stop helping people who are lazy to do a basic search that doesnt make the chat any interesting to participate it i have been reading less too too much pleb help cute but polluting
342663,pin sir
342666,hi everyone i was wondering if some of you might be able to help me out here currently i am doing my bachelor thesis on how blockchain technology can potentially add value to land recordation practises in ghana for my thesis i would like to interview software developers andor software engineers in the blockchain scene if you know someone that perhaps want to do an interview with me please reach out to me would really appreciate itthanks for reading and have a good one
342668,i am sure it has been asked before and we are following closely as a research firm the stepn mania but how do you see the long term evolving for this step and earn hype because the feeling is that when looking at how the system is sustainable we cant find any good answer to that
342669,there is a thread about gns
342675,some stats
342676,why would you not include polkadotkusama
342677,data availability
342678,where did you look
342679,it all comes to the returns after all when things goes south there wont be users growth and app will die team now controls the growth via invite codes no gmt release until 2023 so market makers are incentivized to keep it afloat since there are a lot of traders interest and as long as there are gamblers to liquidate on both sides market makers will keep it afloat
342680,the previous user base will remain mining gst because its just free money but what they really do differently with axies are invite codes i think
342681,yeah i do agree with you forcing ourselves to find the possible sustainable outcome is something that wont produce any result afterall
342682,so the user base is controlled currently and consists primarily from influencers who shill it and generate those codes
342683,
342684,yeah as long as you have people upgrading their shoe than the system is sustainablethe moment our shoe will be earning more gst than consuming then its gonna be an issue
342685,yes but until gmt get first release as seedprivate sitting at thousands multiplies hehe
342686,but yeah glad the vision is the same thank you buddy
342687,i saw many otc popping already and massive discounts
342688,hi all i am a graduate student in it and i am recently writing an academic article about the future of vr technologyi have the impression that there are a few blockchains or nftrelated protocols technologies or projects i hope to solicit some interesting inspiration and relevant material from this group thank you all very much
342689,as its centralized they will try to control it only time will tell im not that intelligent to predict or even fully analyze how sustainable their model is
342690,ethereum had 18 million unique wallets the text and the chart do not say the same thing
342691,brrr mixed up 7d unique with 1d
342692,let me add to it
342693,speaking of caveats what does unique wallet mean
342694,solana is a fucking scam
342695,thers a reason they dont put tron on these because it is also just fake tx
342696,why do they count all the fake solana onces
342697,a unique address that was active onchain thing is you cant say user because yo ucant verify if its an actual human running the wallet regarding solana yea look i get it everyones got different bags here and the numbers will look either offensive or flattering idc what the emotions are i was just looking at numbers and shared numbers objectively but i have checked for bot activity also for sol tx count is not necessarily accurate nansen tags them as entity instructions vs tx have mentioned this in the twees
342699,bots aside which are certainly prevalent id be more concerned with people using 2 wallets which is arguably just as prevalent if not more so
342701,you can argue that the best way to gauge a networks health is the fee model eth ranks highest but fees and consumer adoption dont go hand in hand esp in light of l2s emerging thats the reason why i didnt go in that direction
342703,you can read this thread
342704,thank you i was going through all the threads
342705,
342706,if there is anyone here very familiar with keplr evmos i have a question on recent updates and account derivation in keplr wallet would greatly appreciate it if i could ask a few questions in pm thanks
342708,throw questions here no need for dms
342709,never ask people to dm in here wtf
342710,i thought i would spare the group a bit of back and forth but happy to ask here if anyone is familiar in the recent occuranceschanges in that regard
342712,it seems that there have been changes regarding how keplr derives the evmos address i have an account in keplr which i suspect the address and corresponding key changed some time in early march after an update there have been updates to both keplr and evmos i have attempted to derive the original addresses using various methods but with no success yet update i came across this it seems it could be breadcrumbs hopefully anyway if anyone has some insight into this reply and i will provide greater detail
342714,has anyone tried near wallet
342715,if its derived with bip39 i think it is you can iterate through a bunch of derivation paths until you find itthis project might be helpful
342717,hello sirs anyone here can help me with some software solution that can scrape replies from a tweet i kind of need it urgently
342718,which one of you was thislobsterhr getting out of controlwho was the person creating the anon board to see current compensation rates
342720,deleting a lot of questions how does eth 20 work and other trivial stuff use google keywords and ctrlf in chat asking trivial stuff like this is spamnext time just bans ngl
342721,finding yes guessing no its astronomically rare you guess a private key correctly
342722,cosmically rare is a better way to put it there are more keys than particles in the known universe astromomically only implies known bodies in the sky
342723,yeah exactly
342724,anyone claiming they did is lying
342725,if swap 10e it doesnt work
342726,how much more apy would you want on a new good looking project if you had to lock tokens for 3 months and could only claim at the end versus claiming rewards continuously 2x higher
342727,have trade limits currently before we ramp up liquidity
342729,how much is the liquidity now and how will you add liquidity like lp mining
342731,rn its 7m tvl
342732,across all pools
342733,well have some liquidity mining rewards
342734,i mean depending on how the key is generated articles on it if you google ethercombing being strategical about your guesses doesnt mean its not guessing
342735,are u open to adding more links for charting theres also tradinglitecom coinalyzecom
342736,absolutely there is some crossover in the categories i already had coinalyze in the analytics section so linked that under charting as well and added tradinglite
342738,nice thanks so much
342740,thanks but its not that simple there are different types of derivation secp256k1 and eth_secp256k1 but i sense that is not the only contributing factor herethere is some more info here but it does not completely explain or provide a solution for what occurred in my example
342741,hi guys does anyone know a good rpc provider for aurora chain
342742,chainlist is what i use to see this kind of info
342743,hey guys is there still anyone making rpc tg price feeds unirocketbscrocket style
342744,for chains like cronos arbitrum etc
342745,
342746,interesting
342747,
342748,beef
342749,
342750,does that sounds feasible to you
342751,anyone know what domain they sold
342752,
342753,does anyone have testnet eth for kovan testnetif so please send to this address and ill send you my blessings0xa045abe0a0db949c7f851c9afef69f507e82af9b
342754,2b or 4b val into a 22v val that is not even that amazing given the lockups
342755,building a smart contract to help btc miners
342756,wait what
342757,are those vested tokens what am i seeing
342758,its a bit scary none of this is locked up just sitting on a large bunch of fresh private wallets
342760,but as part of notequity packages
342761,wink
342762,no unlocked tokens
342763,paradigm faucet no
342764,thanks alejo
342765,i think all eth testnet are empty on paradigm
342766,oh no kovan is not other ones are my mistake
342770,okxus matches the data almost exactly largest cex with a us tld transfer around that date i could find
342771,actually cant have been that was sold to someone 20 years old than this guy could be
342772,lol 16m ftm liquidation crashing fantom chain for over an hour
342773,10m
342774,nope
342775,to be fair today roosh was liquidated by 105m ftm with many transactionsthe biggest one was for 2m ftmwhich fueled the competition among arbitrage bots of course but network was online all the timethe gas though surged to 20 000 gwei for some time but 1k gwei was enough for ttf in about half a minute
342776,i was referring to the above tweet
342777,still says a lot that its even a concern
342778,well not only poor roosh was responsible for network congestion a bunch of ftm projects if not all are down today approx 25 which drove users to interact with networkhopefully foundation proposal to lower required amount of ftm to be validator will scale up tps as the consensus mechanism on ftm is asynchronous
342779,crash having to pay more for transactions btw thats what it means since ftm boys are used to low fees 23 fees are outrageous for a few minutes also it does not go through with metamask default estimations ofc
342780,ok so that tweet regarding reason for loan was a lie thendevastation it would cause on chainthere is no way to liquidate that on chaincrashed for an hour
342781,more like over exaggeration
342782,different meanings for different people for the retail that uses daily when default metamask does not go through its the same as crashing
342783,little bit of a hyperbole
342784,no its not its beyond common to have to put in custom gas on ftm anyway i can see that even hinting at something is touching a nerve with a few of you so ill leave the convo there
342785,i have another hypothetical question for yall
342786,i dont understand an i missestimating the price of eth or is it actually 1k in this hypothetical scenario
342787,no lets say your estimate is correct and eth is actually traded around 1ki used such wording as there is no universal truth on what exactly is the price of eth
342788,yes
342792,just to keep in mind re synthetic assets afaik synthetixio was one of the og plays in this space and even had aaplgoogamzntsla and oil listed at one point but with last year they removed them due to a lack of volumedemand they said it was temporary in principle but so far there hasnt been an initiative to relaunch them
342797,nan
342798,1m vol on that candle165b notional
342799,no for ftm there was a liquidation cascade of 50m ftm on scream
342800,for yfi i dont know but its weird indeed
342801,this was interestingnot a statesponsored cyberterrorist should be on more jds so hr doesnt get into trouble for rejecting due to discrimination or bad culture fit
342802,am i missing something or is the basis of the whole thread the assumption that a korean accent somehow means north korean hacker theres plenty of people with bad english trying to larp themselves into blockchain developer jobs its rather unlikely that a high profile social engineering group would launch such a bad and transparent attempt they know better than whats described in the thread
342803,yep youre right thread discussion went that way too
342804,so mkr is joinning curve war
342808,they dont know who they are now how this proposal could be passed if they dont have voting power no incentives for the pool
342809,saddle rekt
342810,
342811,de fuk
342812,focus on gearbox research
342813,it makes sense what it is trying to do but damn must a random dao members be like wtf how can i approve this
342814,we had alot of back n forth discussion in the discord
342815,
342816,for reference yup here
342817,anyone have access to dalle 2
342820,this is our whitehat rescue transansaction which blocks an ongoing attack
342821,deleted to avoid spam
342822,huh total current voting power 56m grant 10m
342823,ya i was expecting more that sentence that he was going on about was obv just a bad english translation could have been a scammer or just larper but how he jumps to his conclusion and posted a thread about it is obv just engagement farming
342824,wow blocksec stonk
342826,
342827,
342828,stop the exploits plzz
342830,rari pool 18 seems to have been exploitedpools 144 and 127 drained
342831,multiple rari pools getting drained
342832,friendly suggestion to gtfo
342833,
342834,sylkf
342835,a nurse is on duty
342836,pool 8
342837,
342838,savage
342839,yes
342840,pool 18
342841,pool 8 is the core thats why i was asking
342842,oh yeah my bad
342843,typed quickly
342844,is the saddle whitehat hack related connected to one of the rari pools maybe
342845,two seem unrelated so far
342846,thx
342847,hes purging every pool
342848,yeah im checking right now but pool 8 doesnt seem to be affected
342849,yet
342850,or at least not completely
342851,90m from the pool 8 and 100 from the other ones
342852,but the pool 8 debt isnt undercollateralized
342853,its collateralized with the hacked funds from 0xb1s pool
342854,yeah im seeing that too this one was a gut knife
342855,18 156 127 144 27 8 146swept the floor on those
342857,big f
342858,
342859,good luck with that
342860,so who is rekt fei
342861,fei fuse
342862,is that a common thing for large defi protocols could aave curve uni etc also pause withdrawals ie are actually custodial
342863,curveuni cannot
342864,aave can afaik
342865,yeah permissioned mitigation logic
342866,too many hacks happening lately true is that we are gathering the attention of the big playersits also true that if we have 1 protocol exploit each week growing is gonna be kinda hard
342867,imagine telling a fund they might risk their capital to an exploiter
342868,who audited them certik
342869,certik did saddle not sure bout fei
342870,also its kinda useless to get audited before launching and stop therei think protocol with huge tvl should undergo periodic security auditing otherwise shit like that will keep happening the main problem is that everyone trust a protocol just because others already did
342871,fei is audited by zeppelin
342872,
342873,so last audit was from july 2021
342874,theyre pretty diligent about getting audits and also making is and ts are dotted with internal crossaudits
342876,i am generally speaking of getting constantly audited which protocol doesnt matter
342877,quantstamp did the audit on fuse
342878,lotta repays and redeems coming through
342879,its funny as its always coincides with general dowtrend
342880,so how was this possible to get hacked
342881,we pretty much have the eyes of all the boomers because btc did except for 2022 currently but still a long way to go outperform traditional assets always everytime stuff like this happen its a feast for them
342883,
342884,peckshield are wild lol
342885,they cant detect a simple math vulnerability on their code reviews and they still have the face to post this kind of stuff
342886,people talking about auditing firms instead of pointing out correctly to the ones that do this shit are just feeding the beast of audits dont work auditors should be liable just point the shit out of the factorylike auditing firms peckshield pessimistic etc
342887,tetranode whats going on
342888,lol
342889,recycle reuse
342890,it seems to me that auditors should be liable to some extent as part of the audit agreement but thats something for the protocols to negotiate as part of the contract as opposed to a general liability sort of thing
342891,the guys from sherlockxyz are testing this theory out love the team there you should check it out
342892,agreed and overall theres a lot of talks in the auditing world about moving from the status quo of heres a pdf and an invoice good luck
342893,lmao
342894,nah auditors shouldnt be liable but people should specifically know which auditing firms dont give a fuck about their reputation and just avoid them even if that represents your product launching in 6 months due to queues on other firms
342895,is there a particular reason you think that projects shouldnt negotiate that sort of arrangement seems to me like it helps align incentives properly
342896,making auditors liable would put a 10x premium to any audit prices and it would be 10x slower
342897,because of my comment above
342898,but i think this service is still desirable maybe not every auditor should do it but some doing it i think would be good
342899,it doesnt solve anything but rather makes it an extra difficult thing to execute because you have all the downside for an issue that arises in any time in the future
342900,would a seed stage protocol pay between 500k and 1m for an audit when they just raised 15m
342901,ahahaha i am uniquely qualified to say no we wouldnt pay 500k
342902,ive had this exact situation
342903,well thats the 10x im referring to hehe
342904,so its a lossloss for both projects and auditors
342905,i think a more adequate approach could be to include an insurance pool with audit process
342906,fair point on costtime increases i think realistically auditing firms would have to purchase insurance and i dont know what that market is like i assume bad and very expensive
342907,yh thats what sherlock does
342908,audit market now is the market of the auditor not the customer demand far exceeds supply everywhere queues for several months in advance to curb the demand many auditors prepare code test software solutions that unfortunately fall far short of the human eye on the other hand there are still unscrupulous customers who want to cut the dough as soon as possible instead of making a good product
342909,protocols shouldnt buy insurance themselves its the same issue users that are concerned about their should be the ones buying insurance
342911,yeah i misspoke meant the auditing firms
342912,but no one cares about that see nxms revenue
342913,auditing firms wont pay 3 premium on 100m tvl per year for the protocol
342914,yeah i think you are correct as the market is now it just doesnt seem to be learning its lesson with firms like peckshield
342915,or if i want to be cynical the value of the audit stamp produces them more revenue than without and the security is secondary since an exploit 612 months down the road doesnt matter if youve already cashed a chunk of profits
342916,can plebs stop suggesting security practices like its the first time this happened its literally retarded i am sorry to be rude like this but every time there is a hackexploit some genius starts suggesting holding auditing firms accountable doing some auditor deposits in some contracts making certik memes etc
342917,so u no fan of pessimistic checking
342918,bit aggressive sir i dont think that the concept of holding the people whose negligencepoor work accountable is an outlandish concept its certainly not outside of crypto plenty of damages have been won irl from negligence by inspectors and the like the answer might seem obvious to you if youre looking out from the inside of a protocol building and getting audits but its not so obvious that this wouldnt work from my end
342919,i know only 1 experience and it was terrible
342920,its not that it is wrong to discuss such things its just that this is the 100th time the same genius ideas are being thrown around and thats whats annoying me haha 3 much love
342921,agree w all luciano said above
342922,what i feel is that they just hired a bunch of people and the ogs that were doing it before just took a mgmt position
342923,alas not enough time to read lobsterdao archives 3
342924,thats not out issue or concern
342925,nobody would ever work w such premise i am sorry this makes 0 sense
342927,
342928,some ideas can be differentsome are dullthis is dull
342929,back to being sick nvm
342930,i agree after hearing your arguments just not a discussion id had before
342931,scuzi i need to find more aspirin
342932,u boys discuss i just read
342933,new intern is too edgy tone it down
342934,cant wrap my head around it tho there are a lot of beforenonreentrant and afternonreentrant
342935,where is the reentrancy here
342936,the fucking gall on this account
342937,i cant believe peckshield still does this song and dance after every hack
342938,sorry ivangbi if thats an unoriginal point
342939,the auditing space is fundamentally broken static code checks for 1 million dollars a year please ah you think thats too expensive suck it up sunshine everybody else is charging the same while we shit on buidlers
342940,did peckshield provide any inputhelp on finding the issue back when you guys were hacked after getting audited by them
342941,not particularly but thats not really the point im making
342942,my point again not a unique insight is that they post these tone deaf matteroffact tweets after almost every exploit as if their own body count isnt well into the billions at this point its gall
342943,3 exclamation points jesus christ
342944,no i know i was trying to gather more data points into this as the projects audited that had a bad experience are the ones with a better input for this kind of criticism
342945,like this isnt a horse race
342947,mmmm nothing entices me as a builder more than a flippant and braggadocious auditing firm laughing at fellow builders im definitely going to use peckshield in the future i really value this professionalism
342948,emm hacken isnt that bad it seems lol
342949,already costs about that much though depending on the clout of the auditor see the bean figures
342950,as for whether adding liability would cause a 10x on that its debatable you cant charge what nobody is willing to pay and thats why it wont happen theres more than enough demand willing to pay the current rates so theres no incentive for anything to change
342951,bean paid 500k for their audit
342952,350k for tob 250k for halborn at least afaic remember their voting thingy
342953,sounds like something would need to change on the insurance end of things but hard to see how that happens
342954,
342955,i wonder what insurance costs are for similarly risky things in a more mature insurance market does anyone know
342956,though maybe there are no good parallels
342957,
342958,yeah that one this was the older tob one
342960,i think its fair its 40k per week while peckshield charges 12k per week
342962,but yeah 10x wouldnt be feasible on top tier audit firms for no one
342963,also for reference compounds openzeppelin contract is for 2m a quarter 160k per week no specification on the amount of auditors people involved
342964,fair i suppose but methinks something is a tad weird with an end result of buying a maybe you probably wont lose all your money using this now but if you do regardless of when it happens you promise not to hold us in part or whole liable statement or statements as some would claim for that much
342966,
342967,wtf is dfk one and jewel
342968,is that what kids got rugged with latest who were the people behind it
342969,isnt jewel defis kingdom token a harmony game afaik
342970,some frens shilled it to me a while back
342972,so is it safer to never use 777 or are there benefits for using this over erc20 that warrant using it w checkeffectinteracrion pattern implemented correctly
342973,jewel was a my first intro to yield farming its a uniswap fork w gamification and some pretty cool features behind it as you farmed you got 95 lock 5 unlock some exploit was found that allowed people to unlock the remaining 95 dump on the market and mods knew for months and didnt do anything
342974,theres a twitter thread iirc cant find it
342975,looks bad on all parties involved but especially so since so many kids liked jewel because of gamification
342976,its a pool 2 token basically with insane apy hidden as game so some ct guys shilled it hard as play2earn for exit liquidity
342977,and they are the first subnet on avax not a good precedent to set
342981,i know a few ourselves included and were satisfied of what came out
342982,step is a copy of stepn who would have thought anyone thinking its actually trying to be serious and not just stealing money gonna wonder at one point why he ever believed that lol
342984,lol true garbage then i guess ye
342985,we found a 2 critical vulnerabilities after their audit
342986,auditor market is completely broken going c4 contest all the way if budget timing doesnt work to get toptiers is the way
342987,thats not smth bad our audits each one has found smth no audit covers everything unless mistakes mistakes are very trivial and then ye its a sign
342988,one was pretty trivial that we skipped after that i lost complete respect also vulnerabilities report were clearly automated through a tool and no human doublechecked them
342989,c4 is also great can confirm but super demanding on the teams tech side
342990,i know no audit will find everything its impossible that is why bug bounties exist
342991,definitely cant complain about audit quality if you choose certain cheap auditors
342992,ah was not able to execute a contest yet it does seem pretty timeconsuming to generate the report right
342993,if you go for rubber stamp audit you get rubber stamp audit
342995,yeap you can do it knowing is just a rubber stamp question is is it misleading to inform you have audits
342996,that for me is the toughest part if retail users want audits but you dont have a big budget for it then you rubber stamp it idk maybe is better to try and inform the community on that side
342997,getting a real audit is increasingly difficult because of scrutiny good firms dont want to deal with anons and want to audit projects they think have a reasonable chance of not getting hacked this on top of long wait times and insane rates mean most protocols cannot go for a real auditso yeah you get what you pay for and now most people should realize that not all audits are worth the same
342998,thats not auditing tho is it then its insurance and thats a different mine field
342999,yeap this is the reason why for me the auditor market is broken basically because demands and incentives are not completely align at least yet c4 strives a good middle ground imho
343001,or is helping bridge that huge gap
343002,and want to audit projects they think have a reasonable chance of not getting hackedwhat does this even mean
343003,it means they wont speak to you if you are a nobody
343004,ah clout huh
343005,weird way to phrase it though
343006,time to set up a clout dao and funnel everything through them
343007,well yeah kind of they have limited resources if you get two audit requests from an anon team and another from aave we all know which one is better for business as well as which one is least likely to get hacked
343008,perhaps but then your earlier comment about settling for cheap audits is problematic
343009,agreed it is its own complicated aspect but then you could apply that to any service that needs to carry insurance for liability reasons medicine at least in the us is a decent not perfect analogy physicians all carry malpractice insurance i dont think that means theyre not practicing medicine though
343010,the great auditors ignore the cloutless and are booked for 500 years by projects with clout of course they do its as you said great for business those projects look great on their portfolio and they also pay those nice fees it should come as no surprise then that the cheap auditors are chosen
343011,i mean im not blaming the teams who go for cheap audits just pointing out the realities of finding auditors in the current market
343012,there are ux benefits such as a token transfer triggering a contract but this pattern has never really caught on defi devs especially newer ones often dont recognize the reentrancy risks
343013,yeap seems that its a pretty fcked situation in theory market should balance new auditor firms should come a lot of them prices and times could be taken down but dev eng could get 10x making their own token or whatevs whats the incentive to be in a midtier auditing firm
343014,clearly there is still a lot of rinse and repeat as an ecosystem that we need to do
343015,aave had a critical vulnerability that went unnoticed for over a year and was missed in multiple audits luckily for them a security researcher reported it responsibility and collected a bounty could have let to a complete protocol drain audits are often bullshit
343016,damn i dont remember this one was it the sushixsushi one listing claimable assets with value per share instant manipulable
343017,oh yeah tob actually was who found it
343018,ty tom
343019,so not quite a year but almost
343020,anyone has around 3 goerli eth
343021,want to test the rust ethersflashbot crate
343022,be patient btw of ownership of nodes is low so it will take some time until it gets included
343023,for flashbots
343024,i have it
343025,yeah
343026,thanks will dm you
343027,yeap try using padigm faucet
343028,good idea last i checked they only had kovan available but will check out again
343029,guessed as much thanks for the heads up
343030,
343031,forget about this
343032,got 05 from that one
343034,im struggling to get some rinkeby may i please be shipped some
343041,
343043,
343044,lmao
343045,ultra rekt
343047,whats interesting is solana downtime isnt really affecting people willing to use solana or build on top of solana
343048,they understand their distributed database
343050,you mean sam office why would they stop building on solana
343051,aws msft and google offer distributed dbs too
343052,all of those offerings have formally verified consensus mechanisms enforcing operations
343053,cosmosdb has its tla spec on github even
343054,whereas solana well noop
343055,
343056,i use this term not in the strictest definition ymmv
343057,sometimes issues only arise when you have other protocols interacting with it eg the recent synthetixsushiswap issue synthetix uses a unique proxy implementation
343058,hi a follow up question does anyone know any other delayed dex execution focused projects like averaging and beyond say what if i want to tie swap execution to an arbitrary pricevolumegas related rules
343059,ftx giving error if l try to open solperp for short
343060,amazing
343061,lt has been over an hour they are tryingto avoid shorting sol
343062,just the usual proof of conference call scheduled maintenance
343063,solana tired
343064,i think now ftx removed solperp trading pair comletely
343065,every perp is down
343066,404 error
343067,lmao
343068,
343069,theyre back on the search box just updated
343070,nan
343071,ok seem back up trades printing on some perps
343072,
343073,is that true or just a speculation
343074,speculationdepends on many factors
343075,stepn did not launch on bnb yet right so now game also should be down is there any player of it to verify
343076,it has but your stuff on sol is not on bnb chain
343077,i might have been a player of it if their activation code system wasnt so annoying
343078,lanched but as a separate account what you have on solana you can use only on solana and what you have on bnb you could use only on bnbalso all functionality works the only thing isnt work is depositwithdraw
343079,at least its took something around that time last few times when solana went down so rather true then not
343080,stepn joint dorahacks solana hackathon they did not selected as finalist and did not get any funding from there dorahacks team leaded them to binance i was quite surprised after all binance support still they deployed on sol
343081,cheap txs mainstream love it security and sustainability doesnt matter
343082,speculation but that does not take the fact that coordinating what they need to in order for a restart probably its a yuge task and last time i think it was about 19 hours until they got it back on
343083,i think lt is not yuga but okay bears i wanted to take position on bears but binance rejected my withdrawal and when l transferred usdt to ftx floor was 3x of original time of interest
343084,
343085,lt means they are done
343086,binance also has the cheap txs though
343087,from what i understand they just agreed to restart the chain at that certain block
343088,u r rightstill need some time
343089,
343090,very decentralized chain
343091,eos was ahead of its time
343092,does footprintnetwork have any upsides over dune the free tier at least seems inferior
343093,
343094,not quite the same delay but crocswap has a speed bump feature
343095,6k gas fee unbelievable
343096,eth guess thats why etherscan is gone
343100,nan
343101,lol
343102,crying
343103,whats going on
343104,apethink its the land minting
343105,yes the otherside minting is live
343107,lol
343108,another set of jpegs clogs entire network while bitcoiners enjoy 1 satb txs
343109,is vitalik gonna turn off otherside now
343110,no but maybe just maybe we could reopen the topic of gas limit
343111,why dont we just block nfts on the network it works for bitcoin
343112,nan
343113,verydemocratic
343114,it misses the point current gas limit sucks balls even for pure eoa call tx blocks
343115,nft trash should live on a rollup where they can piss in their own cheerios
343116,increasing the gas limit wouldnt solve nft mints lately we had gas prices really low
343117,several bucks per eth or even erc20 transfer tx is not low
343118,
343121,what a shit show
343122,tell me about it bro
343123,embarrassing
343124,why tho
343125,6k gas
343126,lul
343127,is that ath
343128,no ive seen it over 9000
343129,nan
343130,the ghost of the kitty lives on 5ish years later
343131,they need to update the ape is the reason for this
343132,
343134,nan
343135,5k for 2hrs now
343136,solanas back up it seems
343137,what a fucking wild weekend
343138,people are minting with 275 eth gas fees
343139,gas wars are way beyond whats being shown in txstreetcom or so
343140,i need to spend some time in nature
343141,block explorers are struggling too
343142,would anyone from lobster be interested in doing a dual twitter space with otocoio to talk about the legaltax side of things for employeesemployers in the defi space we could cover liability to things like getting a mortgage or credit card
343143,also the sister project of otonomoscom who can help whole protocols get grounded in the meatspace in favorable tax areas
343144,and if any individuals are interested feel free to pm for my discord
343145,
343146,can sharding solve the network congestion problem allocate otherside a shard
343147,otherside devs could have spent 10 min on gas optimisations saved their community millions
343148,contracts are basic standard oz 721 enumerables makes me think their comments about dutch auctions are fucked were more about fuck the complexity to implement vs their stance about gas wars
343149,how erc721a could have saved this
343150,not really
343151,oh wait erc721a i was thinking erc721r
343152,
343153,well that was fun who got their otherside
343154,150mil now
343155,lol another distributed db entering the mix
343156,just shifting blame
343157,why optimise their contract if they can just move to a new chain
343158,cobie is already submit to be ceo of apechain
343159,i love how they position this decision as a consequence of what happened today completely their own doingdidnt gas optimize the contract at all beyond other more important things they could have done meanwhile they had already made that decision when apecoin was released not ape token but ape coin
343160,
343161,wrote something on the business management side of crypto
343162,sharding if done right can
343163,wait apecoin its own chain is this where weve landed
343164,id bet they will rollback the chain when scams occur lol
343165,yeah but what if that is what people actually need and want what if nobody from retail is actually cares about that block shit and muh decentralization with such ugly ux and ui i m3an we still using metamask hello
343166,no smart contract optimization blame ethereum we will make our own l1 isnt it just another way to squeeze the ape community
343167,how is the cryptokitties chain flow doing not too much hype from them since the nba top shot success
343168,because quite simply decentralization is the reason for crypto if we start normalizing centralization then its no different from fiatexcept wed be putting our trust in tech startups vs centuryold establishments as such the argument for crypto would be lost decentralized tech kinda sucks now but it will get better in time
343169,are you aware of ethereum infura and conensys eg metamask investors and backers
343170,the one and only backer for the internet itself is the us dod so what
343171,smart contract optimization would make gas fees less in that case more centralization would though i guess thats where yuga are heading
343172,if that were the only factor then yuga would be on polygon
343173,they cant roll back chain and return some stupid stolen ape to user tho
343174,i would consider the eth that he is now holding as dirty from that point on lp wasnt aware and shouldnt be liable
343175,muh jpeg outgrew ethirium on our chain users wont have the hassle of managing private keys or seed phrases we store these safely for their protec
343177,do unoptimized erc721 sc with understanding that mint process will be huge gas wars begin we need our own chain
343178,
343179,
343180,yes but from the other hand you have erc721a and im just curious why not use it or analogues
343181,cause they need to leave preference lands for bayc mayc claims 130000 ids
343182,erc721a by its nature is beneficial only on multi mint eg when one mints 10 nfts in one batch lands minters were restricted to have only 2 per wallet so erc 721a would not be beneficial here on mint while causing higher gas consumptions on trading
343183,didnt know about that restriction thanks
343184,but seriously though the amount of gas fees paid in case of lands does not depend on gas optimization everyone was competing to get land before others causing priority fees to be higher and higheroptimizing contracts in that case would not lessen gas paid overall and would only change the split between base feepriority fee gas optimal contract would just benefit miners who benefit from priority fee
343185,less gas usage more mint txs in block this madness is ending much fastereven though the amount of eth paid by the minters would not change much
343188,or you can do it like pixelvault take care of your fans and avoid gas wars
343189,totally crazy saw a post that they paid more in fees during this mint than any other project this month
343193,im convinced theyre complete idiots or this was part of their marketing strategy they totally had to know tho right
343194,basically they spent average of 1 eth per mint 55k mints were possible burnt 55k eththe nice thing is we are all beneficiaries of this unless you were trying to transact during the auctionif they would have raised the mint price by 1 eth per mint theoretically they could have captured most value there instead of it going to burn
343195,
343196,any big txs
343197,
343198,this looks to be the attempt
343199,guys send some good defi tools like this one
343200,ust is 9b from flipping luna has this happened before yet
343201,is it technically impossible or do i not understand something
343202,is there a tool that calculates the eth spent on a particular smart contracts lifetime
343203,ultrasound can tell you for the major ones
343204,you meant gas spent ryt
343205,say luna mkap falls but ust issued stays the same and no additional ust minted via purchasing of luna yes
343206,yes exactly
343207,its completelly possible technically
343208,ust is not collateralized so if luna price drops and no one burns ust or sells ust it can happen
343209,what happens when ust mc is greater than luna mc
343210,zedseee
343212,anybody minted their nft yet more airdrops for optimism users
343213,very broad maybe vague too but has few macro datasets on metaverse gaming nft messaging is not clear though as is typical of consultantsliked this line regarding mass adoption thoughhalf of our surveyed executives say the lack of standardization of accepted currencies across platforms impacts the viability of digital assets within the gaming industry while 47 cite high transaction fees many industry insiders believe that mass adoption will come when users can buy and sell nfts with the ease of purchasing an item online with a single click
343214,i dont want to think that the exploits and all the defi drama weve been encountering for the past few days has also spilled over into the luna ust ponzi scheme
343215,not yet wil keep going until the fake 20 stops being paid
343216,legit safe
343217,idk
343218,i was able to mint didnt sell
343219,i claimed nft nowbut missed their airdrop ended in feb
343220,
343221,can you explain how you think this is the attempt
343222,just speculation since this address has been funded through tornado
343223,oh ok i think aurora and the whole near ecosystem are making a lot of steps further considering the amount of money backing the near ecosystem i do see a lot of progress being made i am glad the attack resulted in just an attempt and not another exploit
343224,that money gone no i heard some funds turned their back because of 10 apy on new stable from near might be fud might be not but it did pretty brutal pull back since they implemented stable coin and low yield on it
343225,hey please help to graduate im writing my thesis on the adoption of nft please fill it in
343226,because if you dont outplay luna ust yield why even care
343227,i think the market expected a yield war ust vs usn honestly probably some overreacted with that said i am just looking how the ecosystem evolve by time i still dont own anything related to near
343228,yeah i mean its twice lower yield with new risks involved
343229,true but the ecosystem is way better than terra one
343230,i love both projects tho
343231,so one thing even with gas optimization would prices have been that low its not the first time that a simple nft contract was used the cost was essentially what people were ready to pay for the mint even if the contract was efficient people would have just bid more to end up around the same price maybe the network congestion would have lasted for a shorter amount of time but i think we would have seen the same prices even with an optimised contract not to say the minting could have been better handled for sure it could have been
343232,minimum apy decentral bank will be the near staking apy 11 yield early adopters will likely receive 20 apy so we see
343233,seems they are still working on it and near sell off coincided with macro market
343234,what kinda bothers me that contract had some functions for dutch auction so that price computation was complex in the contract but afaik it wasnt auction dont understand why so another method of distributing this sale would also cause lower fees and would actually let the yuga to keep majority of the fees burnedpayed to miners
343235,macro what lmao bitcoin 10 while near from 19 to 10
343236,i think they openly stated that they were against the idea of dutch auction because it isnt fair
343238,they say will be used for somethingalso offered in tiers up to at least 7i was only a 4
343240,yeah that was shell
343242,
343243,interesting
343244,
343245,who uses bridges to drop in arbiterum
343246,
343247,i love that an mev bot got credit for submitting the fraud proof
343248,i do sir
343249,gud mev
343250,very nteresting case oxmikko
343252,chanceofimplosionmakes it more obvious that theres likely not enough liquidity for a safe ust unravel
343253,honestly any hodlr who didnt need to make transactions during that mint event is a winnerin terms of gas usage it stands out quite exceptional less than once a year eventin the future any community ready to dump that kind of money on a project will prefer that it all rains down on the project itself and not the greater eth network
343254,so there were probably some losers ie people who had txs which were critical
343255,hey guyswhat web3 podcasts or youtube channels can you recommend
343256,but it burnt a enough eth to have effects on supply this weekfrom an nft project perspective its a poor direction of funds economic theory would say that the market was ready to spend 55500 ethwhatever other fees they paid and thus the project missed out on most of that
343257,yeah damn finally a project worth enough to come close to star citizen and they squandered the chance
343258,l_girll if u r looking for youtube channels thats a bad start as is
343259,do you have a detailed guide on how to do it because ive never done it and i dont know what i need to do ive read two articles but i still dont quite understand what i need to do
343260,you literally just send money no
343262,dont stress just go for it with a small amount of eth to test it out pretty good guide below
343263,taiki meda is good in explaining yield farming too
343264,uncommon core   ru naval x vitalik intro to ethereum some tim ferris episodes chris dixon vitalik some bankless episodes good guests but they become annoying quickly
343266,taiki is an idiot who marries bags and charges you 70 mo to copytrade his wallet via private discord look at his jewel trisolaris rook thesis follow him and be his exit liquidity
343267,it probably also gave at least a few people incentive to look into to l2sevm equivalence and other distribution solutionsthis is a net positive for the network effectpretty shitty of yuga to shit on ethereum tho when the cause was a simple game theory issue
343268,lots of mental gymnastics to dance around an underlying issue methinks
343270,if his math checks out it shouldnt be long before a short seller tries to bring solana down again right

343277,these are good examples i have quite a few on my compendium that may be interesting to look at
343279,any interesting articlesthreads on comparing greshams law with the current stable coin wars
343280,hey guys
343281,any idea why anchor apy just dropped to 1799 never seen it dropping
343282,there were a proposal they regularly do that
343283,cheers
343284,sup everyone currently trying to gather some feedback for my researchwhat public good has been undervalued and underfunded by the ethereum communitypublic goods can be categorized in community education cryptography zero knowledge proofs developer experience tooling ethereum 1x ethereum 20 and user experience
343285,if you have input for me then let me know looking forward to it
343287,there you go
343291,mental health support for devs against investoooors
343293,quickly traded in and out before reveal using gem but roi def got hit by high gas fees compared to other mints and recent quick flips i had to triple check if gas fees was really that insane high lol
343294,id say epolynya on twitter for spearheading discussion on l2s and the benefits of modular blockchains vs monolithic theyve been a huge voice for getting people to pay attention to the capabilities of rollups down the line and the different architectures they can take they started on rethfinance then moved to twitter after that community told them that they should be reaching a wider audience
343295,hmm do you think the market would have found it acceptable if they priced the lands at 5 eth each to me seems like there can be a psychological barrier that price itself may seem as to be too high
343296,
343297,overview of the main arguments in favour of eth rollups over altl1s particularly with the context of expensive fees in mind
343300,at a glance your contract uses weth as input while you provided eth so you need to convert eth to weth and then approve router to use weth
343301,also no approve and is exactinputsingleparams afaik
343302,wrong naming depends on the interface youve set up
343303,does anybody know of any documentation for the swapr sdk githubcomlevelkdevswaprsdk
343304,
343305,hey what sort of documentation are you looking for and would be awesome to know what are you planning to use it for
343306,i would like to use ethersjs and swaprsdk to make some amm trades from a script
343307,why doesnt onramps come under public goods would think thats the least valued
343309,the yuga model relies on price seeming to be cheap early on then capturing fees on resale at high prices that way the asset looks approachabledemocratic but the business itself generates cashflow theres also the fact that making a lot of people very rich garners a crowd that builds brandnetwork value shill army
343310,mikael abandoned it right
343311,remember there was another defi project that got hacked for some 600700 million that nobody knew of looks like a frequent occurence now
343312,awesome ping me if you need some help mate
343314,nan
343316,i opened and still not so i dont think so
343318,or just use qubes os
343319,also use virustotalav_bot
343320,thats actually the best builtin in qubes os solution for everyone who are working with potentially malicious documents and files
343322,follow these rules and at least know which rules are you breaking why and what it can cause etc and youll be fine mirrorxyzofficerciaethgtknkmrdr_hhcqrnsenjqfpdhhb0w1m2svexdp4swcq
343323,any recommendations regarding distributed plain text backup of seeds like splitting my 24 words seed in 3x 16 seeds lists and storing them in different untrusted think bank vaults places to have a 2 out of 3 recovery mechanism
343324,yeah thats basically what i wrote under letter f
343325,so thats definitely a good tactic for lifetime savings storage but if you need some kind of operational wallet you still have to operate securely on the ground and thats what i was focusing on in my article in other words i definitely agree with you but this scheme works with a certain conditions only like you cannot use your wallet too often in this situation
343326,idea is to have both hardware wallets for front cold operational wallets and a distributed plaintext backup which doesnt require me or wifekids to remember any pinpassword to recover the assets
343327,it has a point need to come up with a reliable way to make this system bulletproof and flawless it should not have a possibility for a denial
343328,winter is here changes are coming
343331,winter is coming
343332,so we r fck long downtrend winter is coming
343333,its weird only australia and nz will have winter this time
343334,whats the website for tracking accurate prices for tokens that are on uniswap dextools or something but not that
343336,oh doesnt sound good
343337,thats one cozy looking lobster
343338,chartex dexguru others idk
343339,anarbayr ser bl ctrlf for that
343340,ath is coming
343341,ah sorri x
343342,guess its time to buy
343343,time to buy more lobs
343344,i guess most nfts rely on the same model but none have that brand value
343345,poly network its by neo l1 the ethkiller from china
343346,i think beanstalk hack was 85m
343347,whats the of hackers getting away with stolen crypto
343348,thinking of making one my friend
343349,depends on how you look at it primarily on how you sample hackers and how you define getting away if you consider all hacks and scams happening and define getting away as not having been penalized yet its probably 99
343350,the problem is that there is more to getting away than just transferring the funds to a wallet under the hackers control laundering and actually using the money especially in size is the real problem and there is a decent chance that especially if the hack was sizeable the hackers have to look over their shoulders for decades and will get caught eventually
343351,time to sell more lobs
343352,as far as i know every transaction coming out of tornado cash now is getting under heavy control so basically how do you launder 600m for the ronin hack for example when everything is under the public eye
343353,blasphemy
343354,to launder 600m into fiat you would probably need realworld structures akin to those employed by major drug cartels other organized crime even if the traceability on chain was disrupted by tornado youd still need to do some explaining where its coming from have a partner that doesnt ask those questions but it really depends on who the hacker is and what their goals for the funds are state actors such as north korea for example have different tools and goals the main point here is that those things are not lottery tickets even after the hack they are tons of work and risk for the attackerit would not surprise me if we see a lot of people related to the major defi hacks of 20202022 getting caught over the coming few years
343355,they wait until some new protocol comes through and launder it anyway even if it takes a few years
343356,there must be a blackmarket value to such wallets im sure some organisations would be willing to pay 50100m irl to gain access to this wallet
343357,have u ever looked at univ3 as an option protocol
343358,hi everyone
343359,yep panoptic borrow lp you buy the option good thread
343360,council of eu analysis on crypto assets 26 apr 22
343361,why do people think just because some hackersan has insert large number they have to use it at once its 600m they can spend the next half a century withdrawing it
343362,getting caught in what sense doxxed or are you suggesting a legal framework might emerge for prosecuting smart contract exploits
343364,is a new legal framework required smart contracts are not different from regular software just because the code allowed for the exploit that does not make it legalalso things like the ronin bridge attack are not even entirely smart contract based compromising a server holding bridge keys stealing those keys and then withdrawing from a smart contract seems easily prosecutable especially since its not some anon project has a rather regular legal structure behind it
343365,panoptic is a perpetual oraclefree instantsettlement options trading protocol on the ethereum blockchain panoptic enables the permissionless trading of options on top of any asset pool in the uniswap v3 ecosystem and seeks to develop a trustless permissionless and composable options product ie do for decentralized options markets what xyk automated market maker protocols did for spot trading
343367,hi whats up with this address spamming 0059 eth
343368,checked 4 addresses they all held sushiverse nft which is a project that rugpulled
343369,maybe exfounders got scared and started refunding
343370,yee getting the eth at ath selling for stables now buying back for cheap and gibbing back
343371,nym pumped about 40 after the news while tomorrow is the first nym unlocking day
343372,thats called arbitrage
343373,
343374,interesting
343375,the address got 610 eth from tornado 5 days ago
343376,is it redunding something like gas fee
343377,who knows
343378,seems like it is sushiverse nft founders
343379,screenshot from sushiverse discord
343380,these project will always be borderline when it comes to regulations the more we go towards a regulated environment the less privacy will be liked unfortunately
343381,the ones with backdoors will do very well
343382,define whats a backdoor for you in this case
343383,privacy and regulation are incompatible
343384,anyone has a list of crypto tax softwareservices
343385,these are who my accountant compared against all of which were incorrect of course
343386,is there a way to keep calling one contract from another contract until success result is achieved the goal is to swap tokens from my contract on uniswaps contract but the swap may obviously fail is there a retry mechanism in solidity i have never seen anything like this
343387,
343388,lobster daily 398 daily recap 1 may1 block production on solana mainnet beta has haltedlink link to discussion 2 another distributed db entering the mix link link to discussion 3 the business management side of crypto link link to discussion 4 strange activity on the rainbow bridgelink link to discussion 5 recommended web3 podcasts and youtube channelslink to discussion
343389,thx
343390,sounds a lot like themis protocol just launched on polygon last weekgreat thread btw
343391,keep using the same nonce and increasing the gas price its an async call so not sure how viable the strategy is its bordering on the lines of mev
343392,it would fail not just due to not enough gas but also slippage maybe other reasons too but yeah i never seen anything like this either probably have to keep calling my contract externally until it succeeds
343393,how do you get featured in lobster daily
343394,bribe ivan
343398,lobster daily is our tool where we are checking discussions every day and summarizing most popular discussionsan engagement watcher is here the main channel is herehappy to help our fam
343399,its really convenient when you havent opened a chat for more than 4 days all hot topics at once
343400,appreciate the explanation very clearthank you
343404,interesting to see it after reading this some years back
343412,heyo check out a recap of the top crypto podcasts of the month via the link below have a great week
343414,theres any service around to gate users on discord by address similar to collabland but for a whitelist of addresses
343415,who the fuck put a lobster in a mittens
343416,those that cares abt its well being
343418,maybe guildxyz can do this
343419,good point
343420,lobs is there a tool to make a snapshot of eth addresses with parameters like holds lobster nft voted in any daoin last 90d
343421,yah ask in lobster kingdom group
343422,the voted in any dao probably is not
343423,but would be cool to develop that kind of tools open source
343424,for ethdubai lobs nft snapshot last time i used
343425,lobs as an example but you heard it here first lol
343426,yeah this should work merci and they should have similar for erc20 i guess
343427,almost same api yes good luck with snapshoting ser
343428,
343429,bruv zach roasting that larp lol
343430,
343431,sorry for a noob question but was tinkering around in arbitrum and noticed that contract for dai is 0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1 so is this something that is easily computed by brute force also odd that the 00009c appears mirrored after the da1 and before the da1 this cant be by chance
343432,eid mubarak to all of you
343433,we made it lads
343434,yeap those address are computable dont know what the deployment scheme is for tokens in arbi but you can mine your contract address
343435,ok thanks
343442,i have not used it myself but this tool can be used to mine contract address with patterns
343443,anyone know if this is legitimate proof or just pure coincidence
343444,
343445,also you can spoof headers
343448,yup
343453,hey everyone thought some of you may like this dashboard i made that gives a statistical overview of the ethereum ecosystem let me know your thoughts
343454,noob question what happened on 20161121 with this 11m spike on ethereum users
343455,ddos attacks this article talks a bit about those
343459,hello does anyone know how to set up a custom domain like appexamplecom
343461,not the group to ask that leo just google it how to setup a subdomain
343462,sorry i didnt know it was called a subdomain that would help thx
343468,lobsters on ice move slow time to catch them all
343469,we need answers summer is coming
343470,hi fellow lobsters yacademys 3rd fellowship block is beginning in about a month june 2022 and we are encouraging devs to apply if youre looking for intermediateadvanced level exposure to the security space learning securityrelated topics from guest devsauditorsspeakers and some handson experience performing security reviews feel free to apply through before applying please note that it is a relatively fastpaced 4week schedule and we require applicants to have enough bandwidth 510 hours to commit to the programfor further reading please check out our introductory blog post our github repo and our first retrospective
343471,who did it better sorry i couldnt help myself
343472,sersdoes anyone know where i can get liquidation data across all chains
343473,ive been a fly on the wall in a cohort and thoroughly recommend it
343474,
343477,
343478,time to fight back
343481,
343482,can somebody explain me the croissanteth thread in simple words i dont get whats revolutionary with those esn and the implications
343483,its just that coinbase might be using ens subdomain in their nft marketplace or other products down the line
343484,like instead of sending coinbase money to your friends using their account names youd be using alicecoinbaseeth
343485,that is gross manipulation
343486,but someones gotta do it
343487,why does it show invalid private key in all of them
343488,the maximum value defined by the secp256k1 curve 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364140
343489,the one with 4790 eth has a valid key but the value is wrong for some reason its 0000000004790012598 eth actually
343490,and on bsc the same address has 460 in tokens but no bnb for gas and bots are draining any incoming bnb
343495,i think thats something to be done manually export the list from snapshot ie and cross check
343496,does anyone know the address of this create2 factory
343498,
343499,context
343500,this bip introduces covenants which is like enforced transaction logic so if i send coins to you you can only send them to fred or whatever opens up some interesting financial engineering possibilities and also useful for lightning theres an idea of doing recursive covenants or something like that which means utxos can inherit covenants down the transaction chain which does in fact sound like a terrible idea but not sure thats in this bip
343501,checking now might be 0x4a27c059fd7e383854ea7de6be9c390a795f6ee3
343502,pretty sure its that but dyor
343503,no avax deploymentalso found thisbut probably another one deployed on avax 248 days ago
343504,this one was deployed by the method described here from the same address
343506,ill just ping him and hope for an answer
343508,its heregot a reply on twitter from toxziquethanks
343510,why is there no checkmark on
343511,because nobody paid for twitter ads or sucked their dick to get one idk u tell me
343512,20k ser gets blue tick
343513,wen treasury proposal
343514,you need to show your commitment to the dao ivan
343515,some scammer in my dms offered me verification
343516,just need to send your private key thats all
343517,jackqack hashscan can do this or can soon do this
343518,it seems like gc is on fire just realized that a lof of development is going on
343519,
343521,not parsing votes atm
343522,soon
343524,if threre is a usecase
343525,is there an enterprise solution similar to bloomberg terminal but for crypto
343526,thetie messari nansen has a news feed rekthq feed
343527,token terminal
343528,check parsec_finance for analytics data and cryptopanic for news old but really cool
343529,talking about bloombergtheyve been using santimentnetas well as coinbaseand bitfinex
343530,probably because of our one of the best on the market api
343531,which dex allow 3rd party tokens to add apr rewards to pools
343532,balancer
343533,as for the dashboards then yes all mentioned above are finethe differences would be in details and what one really want to analyseunderstandyou can do some things better with nansen others with santiment yet other with token terminal im not aware of what you could do better with messari as their data collectionstructuring became weak though havent checked their latest efforts on getting daos covered hope it helps
343534,curve doesnt do it sushi michwill
343535,coinbase as skew
343536,there is really no one stop solution for crypto as bloomberg terminal tbh yet most of analytics are good at some specific data
343537,right skew were doing great job on derivatives data
343538,but i had no chance to try skew as it requires corporate email domain even to register
343539,tbh santiment is easily the most underrated data platformmost value for money in terms of the data and granularity you offer
343540,bancor v3
343541,for evm chain dev should save you time
343542,and save time for users actually
343543,sushiswap onsen
343544,does anyone else have issues with deploying contracts on rinkeby right now my transaction just does not get mined regardless of the gas price it worked fine just yesterday tried alchemy and infura with the same result
343545,
343546,it looks quite interesting they launched free swaps in several networks no gas fee the project at the very beginning of development
343547,dex has been running since november has ido platform and staking
343548,1 messari
343550,does anyone know anyone from moonpay
343551,
343552,are you looking for execution capabilities too i use alpha trading systems if youve used trading technologies to trade traditional markets then thats basically what they do check em out
343553,mainly use them to trade funding rates across cexs they support all the major ones
343554,mullvad vpn now accepts monero paymentsarticle comments
343555,lobsters hi can someone tell me the average salaries for developers frontendbackend in web3
343556,this is a list of comp info i found and added to my compendium not sure if the roles you are interested in are here but thought i would share if helpful
343557,perfect ty ser
343558,daily ape has separate hr channel you can check salaries there
343561,hello sers i have a questionwhats the fastest way to get a job as a frontend web3 developer whats the most popular stack i know basic javascriptcpython stuff but havent done any real programming work but im thinking of starting to upgrade my skillset
343562,
343563,for frontend i think lots of ppl using react ethers js
343564,good example showing how tornado does nothing for stupid people
343565,hey maybe someone could help on how to automatically identify crosschain asset contracts eg usdc on eth on arbitrum aave on matic avax
343566,you can also mess around with scaffold eth or this thing which i just saw on twitter a few days ago
343567,thank you very much react it is then then continue the search
343568,so basicallyduring flat or bearthose are same salaries ranges as for non cryptoblockchain devsduring pumps there are some outliers appearingbut i prefer to not discuss numbers here since its worthless and subjective alwayslook at for more info
343569,great sleuth story user zachxbt continue to be amazing please gitcoin donate to them folks
343570,
343572,anyone know anyone from the ens team
343573,yes why some are here
343574,yooo homies curve is going to do the race to the bottom
343575,3pool fees gonna be 1 bsp just like uni v3 personally would love a 0 fee 3pool but lets try out 1 bsp first
343576,vanityblocks collab proposal
343577,i will suck the d for a blue marks
343578,elon noises
343579,why do you think 0 fee 3p
343580,well curve can always make money on metapools so a zero fee 3pool doesnt hurt us as much but 1 bsp is worth a shot as a stepping stone and we can see if we want to further optimise simulations were quite favorable
343581,ultimately i think going to a 0 fee is possible where the business model of curve changes somewhat a stablecoin project being able to say that acquirring their stable costs nothing is willing to pay a lot of money for that
343582,delete if needed but ac is live now edit its over now highlights he responded to his departurefuture in crypto take on nokyc in defi and solana and panel talked about current crypto news podcast felt short but was andres first live appearance since he left no live qa with chat
343583,cool
343584,he is shitting on solana rn very entertaining
343585,hes showing face
343586,hi all i ctrlfd but didnt see any clarification on if we should or should not post new github issues here im launching a public good and want to spread ownership to builder communities in the hope some fraction of them like the idea and want to steward it as a public good ive filled out a proposal on github as requested the product is permissionless certificates of deposits 100 on chain multicentury stable tokenomics design no governanceadmin required audited etc
343587,will add this to the github issue as well
343588,zach of you are here reading this i love what you do mucho
343589,here is an example for using sushiswap
343590,curve does this
343591,bancor will offer this when its b3 upgrade launches in the next few weeks
343592,for sure theres a liquidityasaservice angle in there somewhere
343593,can you show a tx showing it or something
343594,on curve you have to be added as a distributor to the gauge i believe but once you are you can deposit the specified reward token at will function is add_reward then deposit_reward_token
343595,can you point to any pools that offer a 3rd party emissions reward
343596,i think gysr does this as a service most projects use a staking contract the synthetix one is sort of the go to standard unicurvebalancer dont have a way to do it on the pool level maybe bancor does though
343597,sers where can i short ust to hedge my farm
343598,ftx has a perp market
343599,hm but the curve gauge emissions rewards are for pool lps right for other tokens to add emissions itd need to be given through the same contract maybe if we dont want to deposit the lp elsewhere in case we need to deposit the lp in a farm to compound the rewards or maybe the farm could deposit in the pool and then deposit the lp in the other token rewards contract how is sushi doing it apparently here
343600,i mean for contracts to offer 2 tokens in rewards it seems straightforward
343601,hm but the curve gauge emissions rewards are for pool lps rightnot entirely sure what you are asking but the actual crv emissions and the tokens that get added as reward_tokens accrue separately on the same contract i believe the curve gauges can have 8 reward tokens added not entirely sure what sushi is doing but they use masterchef which has a lot more going on than a standard staking contract pretty sure you would need sushis authorization to start doing this anyway if we dont want to deposit the lp elsewhere in case we need to deposit the lp in a farm to compound the rewardstypically autocompounder farms accept the raw lp token which would receive no rewards on its own and deposit into the actual farm on behalf of the user in any case the lp tokens need to be put in a contract to begin accruing incentives unless you do the calculations offchain of course
343602,
343603,so vaneck is dropping nft too
343604,didnt know u had an nft bro van0k
343605,does anyone have a contact at moonbirds or proof
343606,what
343607,you do not need sushis permission to do that i literally linked a contract that does it
343608,oh i assumed you needed to have some sort of whitelisting to distribute rewards through the masterchef i stand corrected
343609,is it possible to frontrun a token that doesnt allow a transfer in transfer out in the same block the only way i can think of is by holding inventory over multiple blocks
343610,what do you mean exactly
343611,its not using masterchef it has its own redeem functionality
343612,what is token
343613,im looking at an erc20 that claims to be mevproof by this mechanic where the transfer requires last_receivedyour_address blocknumber every time you transfer in it stores last_receivedyour_address blocknumber
343614,is it a fee on transfer you have a repo to share maybe
343615,no they kept it unverified for security reasons so i decompiled can share that if youre interested
343616,mev occurs from exchange not transfer
343617,exchange implies transfer right
343618,sure
343619,def ismevuint256 address_swap_from uint256 address_swap_to payable if creator_address caller require caller new_owner_address if pair_address addraddress_swap_from you can transfer out of the pool buy as much as you want last_received_tokenaddraddress_swap_to blocknumber return 1 if pair_address addraddress_swap_to if youre transferring away from the protected pool then its fine return 1 if not ismevprotectionenabled return 1 if last_received_tokenaddraddress_swap_from blocknumber if not blacklistedaddraddress_swap_from return 1 else blacklistedaddraddress_swap_from 1 return 0 is the rough pseudocode
343620,not necessarily
343621,nb that this is scoped to a single liquidity pool
343622,lets separate the word transfer from the usage in the named function transfer
343623,could you inherit from the token and then call supersuper or something
343624,blacklist
343625,thats my best guess on the decompiler output behaviour
343626,but addition to the blacklist is automated in this function above
343627,the pool mechanics are more important
343628,unless it charges a fee on transfer thats the only immediately obvious mitigation technique i can think of but im also retarded
343629,
343630,is there a limit to the ens name
343631,or did this person mint the limit with just as
343632,always hold amount enough for a frontrun of tokens x on contract a buy from another contract b sell from contract a
343633,always a black sheep in the family or so they say
343635,it is not in the ctv bip
343636,defi hackers market makers whales can be reached for private conversation by this tool from etherscan team
343637,context there is an organized smear campaign loaded with personal harassment and thinly veiled death threats against the op_ctvbip119 author
343638,with this digital store you can pay for vouchers for mullvad through monero btc which i guess enhances privacy
343639,ser
343640,eth per usdc in 18 6 12 decimals
343641,so 3 quants from blackrock recommend i allocate 1 to 3 to bittycoins anyone here reviewed math in this paper
343642,3 btc97 eth
343643,blackrock that a new crypto firm or something
343644,they are a major investment corporation based in nyc more on tradefi things
343645,issue with this kind of research normally isnt typically with the math but more with the inputs to the equations like expected returns risk not being reflective of what will hapopen in future from a shop like blackrock a paper like this is likely part of a broader strategy to show thought leadership in an area they plan to expand to would be huge for crypto
343646,main author andrew ang is aa top notch academic tho
343647,next step is making them farm on chain
343648,i am being told the math is funny to the point of meaningless at best
343649,my reading of the paper without having read the paper is that they thought what would be a socially acceptable allocation to crypto for their clients 13 and then use math as ornament and a marketing tool
343650,makes sense
343651,it does have that backfit feel
343652,10 trillion aum custodian of weath and their ceo can force elon to stfu about coins with a phone call
343653,weird to focus on the skew like that and then just pull 150 out of nowhere in particular yeah these are passable numbers to throw around
343654,why seems factual although the measure from 2010
343655,i mean there are much better gems than 150 third central moment such as this introducing btc in a three asset model the cpt investor wishes to hold a position in btc because of its extreme positive skewness
343656,i believe this is the first paper written by quants that discusses position sizing in terms
343658,lol i can picture the headline largest asset managers models suggests allocating infinity to crypto under certain assumptions i read the paper now and i kinda like that they explore some of the more outlandish allocations their model can suggestat least they arent hiding the large variation in outcomes when varying very uncertain estimated inputs personally i dont think these type of asset pricing papers in any asset class can give very concrete and actionable answers
343659,is anybody aware of some typescript bindings for solcjs how do people compile contracts from js otherwise its strange that solcjs is actually written in typescript but tsc still complains about not having types
343661,solcjs doesnt properly export types for usage at least not from the repo
343662,do you know of any other way to compile solidity in an automated way in typescript
343663,this appears to work but its meant for a different purpose
343673,hello guys flashbottools appear to be offline do you know any other alternative to recover coins in a compromised wallet
343674,for a nontechy user a ui would be greater than having him going through yarn right now
343675,
343676,tnahk you my good ser
343677,lp fees generally auto compound right
343678,interesting pov
343679,bancor v3 going live earlier than planned anyone participated in the beta
343680,50 m 100 slashed size of the trade depending on which market you plan to attackthe highest risk for that behaviour exists today because miners dont have stake in the game
343681,bancor does this treauries getting parked there and they provide an easy to implement reward program for those protocols
343682,not trying to fud here but what is your opinion on bancor dont you feel that the il insurance with their own token mechanism is essentially smart ponzinomics
343683,it is sure
343684,there is no way to escape risk
343685,hmm not sure if that right actually could be to short sighted
343686,primalglenn knows this for sure
343687,you can think of bancor as an insurance provider that covers il not all pools suffer il and essentially if the fees that the protocol earns from its trading liquidity are greater than the il that it needs to cover for lps then it is profitable we can offset risk by controlling how much trading liquidity we provide to a token with more mature tokens having higher trading liquidity than riskier tokens that are brand new in b3 new tokens can seek greater trading liquidity from the bancor dao by sharing in the cost of il protection we call this external il protection and they can deposit a portion of their tokens to cover their lps at withdrawal if il has been experienced note that we also support projects running an lm campaign on their pools and we auto compound fees and rewards for lps automatically rewards that are provided by projects for their pools enter as trading liquidity from day 1 and this helps support the liquidity of their token in the marketswe also have other ways of applying deflationary measures to the bnt token via what we call the vortex burner that takes 15 of swap fee revenue to burn vbnt vbnt represents bnt that is locked into the protocol and supports trading liquidity this 15 can be considered an insurance premium for the protection that we provide to lps
343688,our version 21 of the protocol was deliberately handicapped with regards to how much deposits we could take from lps while we tested some of the assumptions about our il protection we have proven that our model works and in bancor 3 we are essentially removing the limitations that we set in place
343689,the manoeuver proposed in the tweet does not cause slashinganyhow there was a recent hack inverse finance i think that showed this kind of nonatomic oracle manipulation in pow so oracle should use a longer twap anyway
343690,thank you very much for the explanations thats very clear just two additional questions in my understanding most pools are actually unprofitable due to impermanent loss how do you manage to cover for losses if we assume 50 of the pools are unprofitable why is it a better way to hedge il rather than to pay an option on top of a uni v2 v3 position
343691,hey can u pls share your thoughts about alchemix andor send a link to scepticfud articlesthreads about their concept tried to find in chat but found only one thread i fully understand all processes happening in alchemix but still cant decide if its a new genius defiprimitive or economically senseless transfusions of tokens and do we really need alchemix since we have element and other protocols where we can exchange our yealdbearing tokens for p and ytokens so then we can decide what do to with them but aclhemix can suggest only 1 option with socalled altokens debtand also i dont understand if alchemix says that 1 there is almost 0 risk of liquidation 2 we can use degen strategies 100 dai 50 alusd 50 dai 25 alusd and so on why alchemix will not automate this process
343692,anyone have experience with vanity eth addresses pls dm me
343693,why not there is no clear rules on slashing rather just described as a mechanism to discourage malicious behaviour on the network
343694,it is genius because they made it super easy one of the few concepts actually ready for mass adoption
343698,lobsters have evolved over thousands of years they have outlived dinosaurs and will outlive humans the core nft holder community needs to be recognized more and get its own place to meme discuss alpha and moreless ivanpleb more fun more alpha some gifs and even allowed for some degeneracyinvestments after all its the lobster sea and ye shrimps and langoustines and crabs are also welcomethis is a part of a bigger restructuringgrowth doing new cool stuff starting off with a known yet simple idea of tokengatedps it wont anyhow influence the open research and defi flow of lobsters_chat this will just be a more private room where more can be discussed by those who are a part of the core community the current kingdom room will cease to exist soon so as the open discord which has been inactive so if you are a lobster join the real one and be among your peers collabland link sometimes bugs on mobile
343699,only related to nft chat no changes for this defi room
343700,this guy thinks south america is as fake as switzerland
343701,sounds based
343702,your assumption is essentially a 1 in 100 year event if we continue with the insurance model analogy in such a rare scenario the bnt token will back stop any il experience by users and it will cover their il at withdrawal with that said there are levers built into the protocol which allow the dao to optimize aggregate earnings of the system and direct the protocols liquidity away from unprofitable pools and towards profitable pools the dao can also adjust fee pecentage on individual pools and in the bnt vortex burner as a levers to optimize the protocols earnings which it ultimately uses to achieve greater fees than il cost some of these levers will eventually dynamically adjust themselves based on market conditions as we continue to innovate and develop the protocol as to your second question thats definitely an alternative to what we provide with that said we pride ourselves on making financial products that are easyaccessible to use by everyone and primed for mass adoption this means that our platform is geared towards regular individuals and we dont require anyone to be a professional market maker to be profitable we dont want our users to lose money by providing liquidity you can consider the vast majority of bancor users to be passive liquidity maximalist
343703,in eth2 there are very clear rules on slashing its all in the specthere needs to be because slashings are proved on chain otherwise youd need a formal eth governanceimagine needing a hard fork to slash someone that proposed twice at the same epoch
343704,thanks great explanation the emissions of the bnt token how that different from v21 its an unlimited supply and a thing mostly misunderstood was dilution of the bnt token is that addressed in v3
343705,scbuergel saw your comments really interesting how with such low stake opens up attack vectors for malicious actors
343706,can anyone briefly explaiin create2 factory contract
343707,does anyone have a good overview on the flow ecosystem really curious whats going on overthere but missing the good insights on how the ecosystem progressed previous months
343709,
343710,thx man
343711,just grab the compiler off of hardhat what are you wanting to do
343712,he has a hardhat plugin that lets you deploy using create2 as well fwiw
343713,will pbs crlist help with this at alledit nvm dont see how it can
343714,thank you very much for your explanation just dont understand why it is a 1 in 100 year event since bancor research has shown that most of the pools on uniswap are not profitable do you design your pools in a way that makes them more profitable than uniswap
343715,ahh this is the pools on uniswap v3 with concentrated liquidity which our study focused on we are not doing concentrated liquidity in 21 or b3 although our b3 design is flexible to support different bonding curves for our pools
343716,i was frightened
343717,im dumb im looking at this tx it looks like its a transfer from one wallet to another however the wallet only has one tx and then it shows its empty am i looking at this wrong
343718,heres the tx
343719,does anyone know if theres a place like where i can see nodes peers for rollups like arb optimism
343722,there is an atomic swap after this tx to x chain here it is
343723,khanhamzah how legit is meshswap low activity in discord dodging questions about audits and why their contracts are not verified but 200m in tvl and a lot of people are staking reward token
343724,
343725,this was posted in the frax tg a while ago when they submitted a governance proposal qidao also mentioned theyre legit
343726,still doing dd btw
343727,here is the audit
343728,indeed i have been chasing all the leads i can find their marketing is giving off very big tron vibes but qidao did verifyhowever their recent tweet about makerdao is very cringybut people keep locking the rewards indicating a large native s korean newb involvement which for stable farmers and dumpers like myself is a gold minewant to move in with size but keep stopping myself
343729,or lack there of
343730,dao maker growth mentioned them in a tweet also i think theyr legit in the rug wise tech i dont know but thats not something i can comment on
343731,thats a lot of money locked in a protocol so early
343732,
343733,nan
343734,is makergrowth actually affilliated with makerdao
343735,just be careful theres a fake twitter handle being passed
343736,for sure i dont even look at that stuff or care about their airdrop and the related air drops scams but 90 on single sided stables is enticing
343737,discord maker dao just confirmed the twitter handle is legit
343738,belongs to the growth core unit of daomaker
343739,thankshmmmmmm
343740,i guess the brightside of unverified contracts is that they are potentially harder to exploit
343741,thanks boss
343742,what is the purpose of meshswap having you sign a message before signing a transaction the contents of the message are the same as the transaction
343743,maybe gasless approval
343744,but every time
343745,its actually quite a bit worse but i dont wanna frontrun ongoing research there are ways of increasing your odds of having subsequent blocks
343746,
343747,pretty cool conclusion of the imf
343748,if i may this one is even better
343750,
343751,kinda off when you start realizing devs ask literally few mill for forking a few contracts for youlabor is cheap right lol
343752,when did ribbon start restricting countries
343753,really dont think thats incorporated in that figure but also dont know if that counts for every project and the projects they used in their research
343756,was there a massive airdrop recently
343757,i got a notification of a 500 airdrop but no idea what it is
343758,evmos maybe
343759,its through my erc20 address
343761,i have the same
343762,and it is not evmos i got an email for that the value checks out i would really like to know what it is
343763,diffusion on evmos
343764,i think the criteria for that was 400 uni tokens and on one adress i have 396
343765,what happened to the good old days when airdrops literally just showed up in your wallet
343766,hello mike has just been launched its originality is the combination of fulltext search with market data
343767,they still happen every day ending in com io etc and when you approve them you lose money
343768,thats a recent scam yeah dont fall into it just hide these tokens from interface
343769,no checked
343771,whats going on on fantom my wallet tells me current node has delayed 28 hours no matter what node i set
343772,use a different rpc
343774,
343775,difficult week for cryptocom friends
343776,got the same email from earnifi and im too cheap to pay for their service to see what it is
343780,disperse app is expensive i thought it used to be trivial in the 10 gwei days
343781,just use multisenderapp
343782,same
343783,from where are they pulling the data there surely has to be a free way to find out this info
343784,evmos
343785,please help
343786,masonic_tweets dm me your ropsten eth address cant help with rinkeby sorry
343787,since we are rolling out big updates today to lobsterdao anyone who has a job to post to lobshr rather than dming ivan and having a 50 chance of being ignored you can now also post your job to hereit will enter an approval queue and some lobster slave labor mods will approve or not approve if u are spammingonce approved the jobs will be posted automagically to the lobshr tg channel this jobs board which is a work in progressplease give it a try so we can see it in action this is a test in prod beta lol
343788,i think i have some crumbs of rinkeby not much but can send
343789,do token holders get prioirty listing
343790,no its open to all
343791,what about amplice special token holders
343792,if u bribe me personally i will approve your job even if its a scam tho
343793,can you please speed up my tx i feel like btc has faster confs
343794,thank you based god lobster dao
343795,currently evmos is first come first serve speeding up gas not going to make it sooner
343796,got it click faster
343797,ok if u submitted a job since i sent this pls resubmit apologies i am testing in prod for real lol left some testnet stuff in there by accident
343798,oh guys i didnt want to start it too early but i would like to bribe lobsterdao and each holder to take over of lobsterhr to make it printing money for the dao were building this amazing platform for web3 hiring and lobsters are among the daos we gonna airdrop with genesis nfts wli was going to officially announce it later via proposal it is even 90 ready but here we go
343799,is the link safu
343800,apptr3butorioquests safu safu no need to connect wallet
343802,
343803,or a more modern
343804,damn that looks far more complicated than it needs to be disperse is far more straightforward the incentivetodistribute feature is interesting though
343805,how can we prevent elephant money style exploit
343806,whats with the inversed ocean protocol logo lmao
343807,lets rotate it 90 degrees nobody will notice
343808,idk if there are any bal devs here but gnosis app broken blz the fix
343809,what specifically makes it look more complicated
343859,clearing up a bot parade thx for tagging me fam
343860,there must be a way to definitely kill the bots right
343861,they are getting smarter from day to day so nvm just tag me or any active admin
343862,cool just fill the form
343863,does anyone know the peopel behind benddao
343864,seems like a cool project in some ways but page looks extremly sketch
343865,yearn v3 vaults in solidity vs vyper end of an era
343866,v1 was in solidity
343867,didnt know this would actually be an interesting article to hear about how the decision process worked to go sol vyper sol
343869,i think machi is involved
343870,tron dao has launched usdd
343871,does this take the award for most complicated bridging in history i am shaking with fear reading this
343872,wtf scrolling through that alone takes a day
343873,aka super sketch
343874,the question is what can you do with usdd after all that bridging
343875,earn 30 apy risk free
343876,v3 is also in solidity
343878,
343879,
343880,main reason was number of developers that know solidity vs vyper the fact that the decision was made very soon after the current version of vyper was released a release in vyper is not ruled out though
343881,for one i read the homepage a few times and im still not entirely sure what its saying can i send tokens to n addresses or does it create a bunch of contracts for each address or one contract that someone has to call to execute the actual distribution that creates a bunch of contractsdisperseapp otoh goes straight to the point zero fluff inputting the addresses is also pretty simple compared to that table thingy on the split site
343883,one looks really shows you immediately you can use it to send tokens to n addresses the other spends a lot of time talking talking about how it may be useful in doing something to n addresses
343884,this is so incredibly cool
343885,splits doesnt send tokenseth directly to addresses it instead very gas efficiently updates internal balances and then allows recipients to withdrawit doesnt store any data on a split ie the address list and percentages to split you have to actually provide that yourself every time in the call data
343886,how do i get etherscan to update their proxy ui after updating a beaconproxy implementation it is still pointing to the previous implementation abi onchain everything is updated correctly the beaconproxy contract itself is pointing to the new implementation contract
343887,you can try rerunning the proxy checking tool right here though have to say we dont yet have native support for beaconproxy in my todo so might be a bit wonky as it relies on a completed transactions delegatecall to trace for the implementation
343888,thank you for the reply i tried doing that but it keeps suggesting the old implementation contract it would be really cool if one could manually pass the implementation address will try to make a call and rerun it i am doing this on rinkeby in case that makes a difference
343890,yea once i get native support up it should be able to track updates to implementation addresses much better
343891,it worked after i made a call to the new implementation thx
343892,interesting thats not clear at all from the homepage then again i suppose the problem is assuming it is in the same niche as something like disperse
343893,i share this with team thank you
343894,both involve transferring ownership of tokens
343895,hey guys ive made a technical guide on nft metadata and immutability hope it will be insightful to some of you
343896,appreciate the arweave awareness
343897,what would you say is missing for more arweave integration wrt metadata easy to use dev tools for evm nfties
343898,im not particularly aware of how the average bulk nft drop is prepared but arweave can do everything a centralised server can do in terms of storing assets and metadata so the same rules can apply to easily get files on arweave you can use ardrive or arkb cli
343899,im just wondering why isnt every nft project using a solution like that seems like a no brainer so must be annoyingdiffciult to do
343900,its not free like ipfs
343901,it costs ar tokens
343902,which is what i imagine is the barrier
343903,yeah its more getting the tokens i guess rather than the cost itself
343904,anyone who wants to do this i can send them some small amount to cover the uploads its very cheap
343905,the barrier imo is the temporary nature of such store everything storage chains at least on our end
343906,arweave is very futureproof has thousands of miners incentivized to store data for hundreds of years to come
343907,my take is that protocol labs and ipfs just spend a lot more effort on getting projects to launch on their stack even though ipfs is mostly just a server in the basement of protocol labs headquarters
343908,ipfs has been a masterpiece of propaganda everybody thinks you store stuff there and its decentralised
343909,haha yes actually arweave has a huge amount of money flowing into ecosystem projects
343910,they fund a few things im involved in infrastructure that makes it easier to get content onto the arweavw chain
343911,this makes no sense sorry
343912,i admit to not being an expert so i would like to use this chance to learn and possibly help others learn if we reach some conclusions here let me ask some questions
343913,ok sure happy to try and answer
343914,first the basics if i pay x ar to store a 1 mb file and this ar is put into the chain which is then used as kind of a basis for inflation which is paid to those that store this file is that it give or take
343915,as a side note arweave is also a contender for the eip 4444 proposal to store ethereums history
343916,theres kyvenetwork which is specialised in storing chain history on arweave for easy access
343917,not inflation fixed supply but the cost scales based on a formula that takes into account the cost of storage and how often hdds break
343918,every piece of data stored on arweave slightly overpays and that fee goes into a long term endowment to compensate miners
343919,ok so there is a fixed supply preassigned to be given to those who host files that others have paid for in ar the more arpaid files you replicate the more of that fixed supply in reserve is assigned to you over time based on some oracle that estimated hdd costs
343920,im not sure about if its true that the more of that fixed supply is reserved for any given miner but yes generally correct and not an oracle but price is adjusted each update
343921,this is more in the yellow paper realm ill find a link
343922,
343923,okay lets assume the economy is tuned to last for 200 years so that if i pay 5 ar today my 1mb file can live for 200 years beyond that no one gives a shit since we will all be dead it is futurechildrens problemsnow if every bit of media is weaved with the other bit of media data then this presupposed that everyone has to repin at least some data though they can select which since the weave is not linear right
343924,im not sure i get the question the general idea is that the incentives dictate that it is most profitable for miners to store as much of the weave as possible
343925,because when called upon with a bit of data as their recall block if they cant produce it they cant mine the next block and get the reward
343926,ok so how does that jive with the builtin censorship module specifically this
343927,just that its not profitable to do so
343928,if i can choose not to propagate some content how do i continue the blocks if that content is in line to be linked to produced
343929,how can it be not profitable if it was paid by the customer it should be as profitable as anything else no
343930,if you choose not to serve some part of the weave you step down from being able to prove recall and therefore step down from the mining rewards if the _proof of random access_ algorithm selects that block as proof from miners
343931,
343932,hey guys im a dev on a yeild aggregator that has recently gone public am i allowed to post the link to docswebsite here
343933,that seems conflicting am i not incentivized to then host everything regardless of how evil
343934,yes you are there are other protections beyond the nodes that filter for the evil factor
343936,
343937,there is something that does not make sense to me here still if this can screen content before i opt to repost it and i am supposed to repost it per the protocols rules and when randomly sampled i do not have it how does this protect me from being kicked out of the miners
343938,there are two layers to the architecture miners and gateways gateways are the http endpoints and can choose to bar content
343939,miners could too but that was an example for gateways
343940,ok but there are many references in shepherd too to actual miners not propagating the content not just gateways but it makes no economic sense for anyone to not store everything
343941,so youre saying nft project dont use arweave because they think it makes no sense and doesnt make their nft more decentralized
343943,in a way yeah mostly just trying to learn about the usp
343944,we chose against it because of token barrier because we do not believe store everything chains can last and because of this censorship potential that i am still trying to wrap my head around
343945,someone ban the fembot before it begins
343946,just tag admins next time pls
343947,if 5 ar are payed to incentivize storage for 200 years what happens if ar crashes in price by 50 is the file then only stored for 100 years instead
343948,ar is the only recognized currency real world value of it does not matter but yes it is entirely possible that due to the price crash and lack of interest ar goes to zero at which point it becomes economically impractical to host files due to cost being much more than profit even for idle machines with storage and so bits of the weave will start disappearing until availability becomes so low that no one will be able to continue the chain thats what we mean by storeeverything chains are infeasible
343949,
343950,well said
343951,gm fam just wrote an article about osint mindset a bit of crypto and web30 i hope yall enjoy it there is an awesome bonus in the end of it mirrorxyzofficerciaeth5kskjotgmtvgc36v1gqz987n_oj_zwvgatok0a47ws

343966,good ribbit everyone
343967,i minted my lobster but have been ootl where is the best place to stay on top of all the lovely perks that us lobster holders get
343968,gm
343969,guess no sign in with ethereum after all
343970,how dare they
343971,ser now seafood discord only on view mode but my wallet with lobs verified from the first day should i reverified
343972,yups moved to telegram
343973,many thanks lobster fam
343974,im building a web3 games console with nvidia would love to chat to the lobsterdao about something how best can i get in touch
343975,how is this not getting more attention for once i agree with chris that this is a huge attack vector for defi
343976,lost interest at the conspiracy theory tellor shill tbh
343977,tfw mentioning something shill
343978,nan
343979,good review of contributors rewards and one on compensation and team token allocations
343980,of course theres an alternative eg this suggestion would already improve the situation quite a bit
343981,no alternative to chainlink does not mean that we cant push chainlink to do better
343982,theater
343983,gives you warm and fuzzy feelings of something is done but lets be honest that is theater practically useless for the more interesting attack in here
343984,oh baby i dont think it could get any worse
343985,after ronins hack i would believe anything could happen
343986,is that being updated
343987,ehm thats exactly how you could prevent that you define a primary and a secondary aggregator switching between them can be instant with 320 in case of a primary failure but if you want to add a new aggregator and switch to that you need to wait eg 12h
343988,and pray tell how even 500 layers of aggregators does anything against a regulatory attack
343989,i dont get what you meanthe main issue is that right now you only need 320 sigs to instantly switch to a fraudulent selfdeployed aggregator with the solution proposed above you could still do that but you need to wait 12h and therefore give protocolsusers at least some time to react
343990,read this again
343991,yes still dont get you you fear a regulatory attack on what if the answer is 320 signers you have the solution above
343992,welp carry on
343993,wow youre good at discussions thank you for your valuable input
343994,no point going back and forth if you cant be bothered to read through and if you genuinely think what you suggested does anything against a regulatory attack then i have a golden bridge nft to sell you
343995,wdyt about this thread not a direct rebuttal per se to the specifics about the 3out20 thingie in discussion but this kinda address the problem too iwo
343996,it doesnt address it so much as explain why the way things are and are unlikely to change much its a trustworthy network which is at least afaics for anything like chainlink inevitabletrust that chainlink never gets rekt or at least you realize it happens before you get rekt yourself so far they havent really gotten rekt so the trust is largely justified it is still however trust feel free to crank up the multisig to 1920 or 4950 but even more privacyconscious and distributed setups have been plucked apart
343997,yeah kinda agree besides it goes directly against the truth not trust motto from chainlink
343998,so what usually happens when a team member is toxic in a dao lets assume toxic member has an community voted position and that the toxicity was not realised in public channelsis there a vote to remove this person how does the proposal look like are the toxic encounters leakedif anyone has any examples i would appreciate it the only one that pops to mind was the latest sushi debacle
343999,case by case basis but has been and imo should be voted by the dao time immediately comes to mind as an example
344000,one that comes to mind was this one from ens
344001,time was simpler because the toxic encounters are public knowledge the issue here is where it only happened in dmsprivate chats
344002,on the other hand if there is a toxic community member what would dao do
344003,thats true an example of not using a dao to replace team members was safemoon havent been following it too closely but ive heard theres been some shenanigans tied with that
344004,great question too if the dao has guidelines for the chats and they are being broken he should be removed from such chat his vote will always be valid tho
344006,there must be code of conduct approved by the dao and punishment resolution procedure by dao delegates or token balance voting
344007,so if no such thing exists create it first
344008,its inevitable but it could be implemented in an optimisticlike model
344009,devil is in the details here semantics what defines a dao team member how decentralised is the dao if theres an operating entity that constitutes the team etc
344010,can anyone here explain how a dns vulnerability leads to modifying contract addresses on a website from the post mortemattacker used a dns vulnerability to modify the router contract address in our hosted filesi can understand a exploit that uses dns redirect but thats not a vulnerability with the dns service thats a problem with the implementation or securing credentials to an account with a registrari dont see how a hacker could have used dns to replace a contract address in ui code without access to the host or cache access to the filesive asked in their discord but havent received an answer
344011,redirect
344012,this isnt a post mortem this is a cya around sucker goodbye note from the devs
344013,like where the hacker would edit the dns records of the targetvictim site to point to a fakemalicious site
344014,there have been defi projects that have had dns based attacks resulting in loss of funds before
344015,yeah i am not aware of an dns vulnerability that allows editing html or grants access to a host unless theres a trust between some dns entry and the host to be able to modify files without credentials
344016,dns protocol allows for many things eg you can stream video over dns however editing html static files is not one i am aware of
344017,yeah which is why i was trying to track down what specifically was going on here or how dns could be used to replace contract addresses it could be modified midstream but not when the content is encapsulated in httpsapparently users were prompted to approve the malicious contract so the malicious contract was loaded into the host and they did claim it was fixed instantly so i wonder if they just changed a password and reverted the file
344018,nextdns is a service i use that is helpful in protecting against these kinds of attacks not sure if would have helped in this situation but thought i would share
344020,
344021,hmm i wonder if mmfinance was calling an external site for the hosted js file with contract information
344022,how was the badger dao hack done
344024,supply usd and borrow btc sell btc for usd
344025,you can do it with wbtc in gmx arb and avalanche

344029,we are nto there yet index needs to go to single digit or a solid 10
344030,
344031,actually good q is that even so
344032,they are figments of our imagination used exclusively in pitch decks
344033,not trying to throw any shade on orca i just cant imagine there is that much daus in general
344034,i love when i see my solana cyber bullying in lobsters _
344035,its going through the stepn app if you think stepn app can have 150k daus then its possible for orca to i guess
344036,
344037,dont underestimate the power of the move 2 earn revolution
344038,ah okok then it totally makes sense
344039,but how are we defining daus
344040,ips addresses
344041,i mean you do understand how stepn works right
344042,its not like a metamask wallet where u can toggle addresses or have a vm or whatever nonsense
344043,it is just a mobile game on a phone
344044,so 150k phones are pretending to step
344045,pretending to step what
344046,my friends gf and my gf are buying shoes its not a joke that shit ponzi got real adoption
344047,when looking at latest me popular collections looks like 90 of volume created by bots
344048,the idea that 150k actual humans a day are using a step tracker app on solana is almost as ridiculous as the idea that 150k actual humans a day are using a solana dex
344049,lmfao
344051,well the income u can get from stepn walking daily is higher than an average good job in singapore which isnt a low income country
344052,just another gud ponzi
344053,if you can afford the shoes
344054,ok but youre saying one hundred and fifty thousand individual human beings are using it every day
344055,vs like ten individual humans running tens of thousands of phones
344056,
344057,like i dont even know if you can find 150k people who could tell you what solana is
344058,tbf i didnt say that it was individual human beings i just said it was an app on a mobile phone
344059,im sure thats an exaggeration but
344060,theres probably alot of 1 human 10 phones though
344061,well the beauty is that i think the average stepn user uses it without knowing its solana
344062,like isnt that the goal of shit we build eventually
344063,sure thats fair
344064,ok they actually ask u in the app whether u want solana or bsc depositswithdraws or something but thats it
344065,this is where id say you implied it was actual dau
344066,when infact its sol bag holder bots
344067,would be worrisome otherwise
344068,nan
344069,of course
344070,there are 91k stepn shoes minted and lending is not released yet idk if 150k possible when app require a shoe
344071,where did people get the idea you need to walk for this
344072,if it actually produces worthwhile rewards people will just reverse engineer whatever the mechanism is and hardcore bot it unless they limit the account creation a lot through kyc or something it will just get drained or the rewards will become very low this is my main argument against any x2earn ponzi that doesnt actually require tasks that can only be solved by humans and even then it would eventually need an actual income stream that isnt emissions
344073,no i was trying to say that a stepn user doesnt even know what an address is their just using an app on a phone
344074,
344075,pretty much whip together some shaking contraption or strap it to some animal and you end up with the same thing
344076,well yeah stepn is just another ponzi that will collapse when eventually enough people exploit it like axiescholars
344077,short it lmao
344079,why are we talking so much about this
344080,its like the 150th fitcoin thing is it because it is on solana
344081,same line of thinking as proof of work magically imbuing value
344082,whats the best way to control an exploit like this or other p2e games ip blocking frequent phone number authentication or is there some kind of way of blacklisting wallets with similar root wallets
344083,you will never stop bots until the end of time
344084,looks like that 2m exploit on mmfinance was just a dns redirect digging through all the discord messages it seems people reporting invalid ssl certificates at the time the exploit was initially reported
344085,
344086,has this been asked before soz is there a list of addresses identified as sybil attackers already on hopfound here
344087,someone shared this here already
344088,
344089,
344090,gfs love the shoes
344091,anyone from the rabbithole team herewe accidentally found a vulnerability that allows anyone to get into the admin panel interested in the best way to report an issue
344092,not from their team but probably best to reach out through their discord
344093,misleading clickbait tho
344094,ohwait sam kessler that name rings a bell i think he was getting some heat after he did a piece about another protocol but cant recall exactly what it was
344095,youre probably referencing my first article on juno which some felt didnt dive deeply enough into the background of ccnthe whale frankly fair criticism imo this weeks episode was an interesting case study around validator responsibility definitely not trying to pump out clickbait and have no ill will towards juno the folks i spoke to on the record were all super thoughtful headlines are just generally worse than tweets when it comes to capturing nuance
344096,we submitted feedback and were trying to dm some of the admins but no one cared lol
344097,nah it wasnt a juno piece because its the first time i read about juno in coindesk olympus maybe cant recall doesnt matter i guess
344098,ah a lawsuit doxxed one of olympuss founders and coindesk posted an article on it a while back guess there was some back and forth around that incident too
344099,is it sustainable
344100,never ask1 a woman her age2 a man his salary3 a defi protocol how sustainable their yield is
344102,yes completely literally no possible flaws in this system
344103,dead
344104,ajajajajajajaja
344105,on the serious note p2em2e systems by definition are sustainable until money inmoney outthat is the basic model and if you want to know if you favorite p2e will be alive in 5 years check is it good enough so that people would love to spend money for entertainment if your protocol is full of users who expect returns and use it as a source of income yeah you know the answer vcnew users money will run out some day and protocol will find equilibrium on a lower level
344106,vc money will be first out
344108,
344109,so roughly 30 of the bitmex insurance fund
344110,30 they have more than a billion usd in the insurance fund
344111,fucking gangsters and im not referring to bitmex
344112,30 of usdt fund not btc
344113,
344114,yo what part is gangster
344115,tradfi are the biggest gangsters
344116,yeah what do you recommend
344117,im clueless in this area
344119,frens how much do you usually donate to gitcoin devs to be eligible for airdrops
344120,hey guys can anyone recommend some good nocode flash loans app
344121,i think furucomboapp and defisavercom are the only no code solutions at the moment
344122,im so happy man exactly furucombo i was trying to find big thanks to you
344123,instadapp can also be useful for some use cases
344124,thats a good question but i dont think its based on how much rather which project you supported by donating i usually support projects i believe in regardless of drops announced or noti may be wrong though
344125,who has coins to sell off i want to buy
344126,its not bitmex that has to pay its hayes and his cofounders personally its a joke each of them is worth hundreds of millions if not more its pocket change to them not even a slap on the wrist for actively enabling sanctions evasion meanwhile virgil griffith goes to jail for giving a talk about stuff anyone can google i know he deliberately broke the law too i just think it isnt even remotely proportionate
344127,i know one of them and am 99 sure he doesnt have anywhere near that kind of money
344128,ay yo
344129,
344130,on chain detective
344131,each report must eliminate a minimum of 20 related addresseswhy so high
344132,i like hops ideas to reward airdrop hunters hunter
344133,snitches gets snackers
344134,but if i am the airdrop hunter i will make an annoucement that if you hunt me but dont report i will give you 50
344135,but would a hunter take your word promise and stand a chance to gain a bit more vs taking the guaranteed bounty from the team
344136,ive been bored with youtube lately i usually have it playing in the background more as audio than anything and i just cant land on anything i can actually get through anymore
344137,also that advertises you as a target so any one who sees it is in a prisoners dilemma you cant pay them all the first to report to the team gets free rewards
344138,so many reports
344139,just report your accounts
344140,one thing i am afraid is that after excluding all hunters therere only 100 true users of hop
344141,fr the incentive is just to take the l and report your own accounts you get 4x less free money but still free money
344142,snitch to earn
344143,shhhhh
344144,when insert 3la airdrop
344145,question what would you prefer when projects giba no steps taken to removing airdrop farmersb attempts to remove farmers from airdrops
344146,c airdrop to me
344147,a given the fact that ill sell airdropped tokens within two weeks and i dont care about project and not looking for new responsibilities
344148,we call that whistleblowing in 3laspeak wen whistle token
344149,actually i have one question should users be airdropped since they already enjoyed the service
344150,unless youre farming arguably ev across airdrops to you if an attempt was made to exclude farmers not data based opinion
344151,wen whistle
344152,nan
344153,snitches get stitches could be a good campaign
344154,whistle managed by the snitch dao
344155,all proceeds from a successful snitch gets distributed to the rektor team responsible for the takedown
344156,arguably enjoyooors will be the most likely to be incentives aligned and show loyalty to the brand i think ops modifier for being active in governance was also a gd indicator but its gamed now so thats done
344157,sec an inaugural placeholder member of the dao
344158,if you whistleblow against another 3la all your cbdc accounts will be frozen and social credit score will be permanently locked at zero
344163,wondering how the team identify the reliability or such reports manually
344164,all aboard the time for dying projects to try and pretend to be relevant with a dying breath grasp at a community via a token look at optimism now hop its a good way of bootstrapping liquidity but you can only do this once
344165,optimism has lower tvl than harmony ffs hop is 110th of stargate just die already
344166,web op token
344167,ok optimism is slightly above harmony but snx is 41 of optimism its a ghost chain a token wont revive it
344168,hop is not dying
344169,i personally like the governance approach theyre taking not sure if it would be enough to revive but it will be beneficial
344170,its not dying but its not going anywhere either this is a crowded market and the euphoria is wearing off these token launches do not address the underlying issue of better competitors the pie is shrinking every day launching a token is just going to hurt retail when they ape in and get dumped ondefi protocols dont need tokens
344171,i admittedly havent followed stargate but hop recently bridged 2b in volume before a token that doesnt sound like a project that isnt going anywhere if they turn on token incentives that should help them compete
344172,fantom
344173,hurt retailpeople sure love to coddle this amazing retail
344174,ape inhurtwen personal responsibility
344175,preach brother
344176,robert freeman terren peizer dennis levine lowell milken john a mulheren martin siegeljust to name a few ppl who have gotten the same sort of plea agreements
344177,mike milken too
344178,america is for sale dont be daft
344179,token is 8th wonder of the world ser
344180,stop youre making too much sense fren
344181,is there any reason new tokens dont use eip2612 i know erc777 has the reentrancy issues but 2612 doesnt seem like it should suffer from any such issues
344182,any idea of utility i could add up to my on chain art on solana something like hight speed node like cubes
344183,is it possible to filed an fbi report on a rugpull like geist
344184,why would you sirrisk on environment innit
344185,why is it a rugpull though a farm to dump token did exactly what it was designed and marketed for
344186,im not sure calling fbi cause you lost money on some degen farm qualifies
344188,about 3ac vs lfg drama
344189,is it me or this dude is slowly losing his shit to insanity theres a huge shining vibe to most of his tweets
344190,if you are the founder of a 27 bil mc you could be distanced from reality just saying
344191,yes i figured that comes with a gigaton of pressure especially when youre building the plane while flying it
344192,and youre also taking a lot of stupid s from all sides
344197,this is a winning attitude in crypto otherwise end up like andre
344198,id say hes one of the elon musks of the crypto space with the right proportion of course
344199,hes a good builder for sure i dont much of the structure and how they built all this but props no doubts
344200,sad possibly true
344201,dear fbi i lost money buying a token that i thought holding would make me rich therefore it is a rugpull can you pls do something
344202,for emn rug pull
344203,thats why now regulation should be coming once the port is big enough
344204,they will manage to force banteg and andre to return the money
344205,speaking of force considering there wasnt even a ui for this thing did anyone get forced to torture themselves finagling approvals on etherscan just to put money into some random contract hoping theyd get richer
344206,am i the only one getting this bug on metamask where i cant scroll down my list of wallets when i try to connect one of my wallets on
344207,the scroll offset keeps bouncing back to the top for me
344208,
344209,bullish
344210,great way to know how to farm my taxes away
344211,machine learning to predict apy stability
344212,mmm where the documentation relating to this could be pretty problematic i didnt see anything from docsllamafi
344213,hi cant access balancers discord so ill ask here are gauge tokens such as bstethstable gauge tokens transferable
344214,optimism bridge is too slow
344215,machine learning is kinda useless in such tasks probabilistic approach wont work because its almost impossible to make any generalisation over financial signals with large number of participants involved
344216,i guess they predict changes in tvl not farming rewards in
344217,for example if changes in tvl for last 2 weeks are pretty low then apy stays same otherwise if tvl increases you can predict how much it changes later and understand how it affects to apy
344218,hey im a copywriter that specializes in working with projects for web 30 who can i talk to about doing some writing work
344219,hey jacobjust looking for onemind if i dm
344221,biweekly update on the polkadot ecosystem a lot of stuff happening
344222,i could see machine learningpredictive modeling to be useful here im by no means an expert in farming but id think features like pool age tvl apy relative to similar pools would all be fairly predictive of stability if pool is new with high apy compared to similar pools we would expect apy to converge to market rate
344223,one of main challenges here is information and resource asymmetry some of the participants have insider information and simply more money which generates massive randomness for a model as a model obviously is not aware of that information
344224,i see transfer and transferfrom methods so i would say yes
344225,any model would be far from perfect here but im pretty confident it would be possible to significantly outperform random guessing the devil is in the details and the success of the effort depends on the features and modeling approach in principle should be much easier to forecast future pool apys than something like stock returns tho
344226,why would someone make a random financial decision tho majority is aping into larger pool based on its reputation
344227,i know that there are a lot of people here that can give good feedback
344228,with random guessing i was referring to a benchmark against which a models predictions are evaluated ultimately hard to say how good a mode is without seeing outofsample predictions
344229,isnt pool apy just a higher order form of stock return i have no doubt you could learn constants in the pool formula from the data but that doesnt give you much predictive power
344230,for the reasons mentioned above
344231,no worries
344232,shitcoinstablecoin classifier that outputs a little emoji in a column everyone is happy no one gets hurt
344233,not exactly because the apy doesnt represent the total return because of il and changes in values of pool tokens at short horizons stock returns are more or less mean 0 with almost no autocorrelation but apy is always positive and very autocorrelated also things like incentives and their schedules may make things more predictable
344234,we open sourced the model also
344235,tyvm really helpfull dashboard
344236,awesome stuff appreciate the free api too ser
344237,tbh dont get why people find this so strange its actually really easy to tell naively whether apy will drop or not for example when aave launched on polygon it was very easy to tell that 2030 apy wouldnt last long since this was a very trusted platform that was battle tested and sure enough it only lasted a few daysyou can apply the same logic to masterchef pools that launch see a spike in apy and then it drops predicting things like that is quite easy so i dont see why should it be an issue to train a model for them
344238,almost every crypto participant will also be able to tell that usually when a product launches apy is high because its high risk as it is untested and a lot of people dont want that risk and as time goes on and product doesnt get hacked apy goes downthis is such a simple prediction yet it proves that its possible to predict apy stability
344239,and this is literally a generalisation over financial signals with large number of participants involved that is very easy to prove true empirically just look at any defi launch
344240,the reason is simple risk goes down with time so apy goes down
344241,im not saying its unpredictable just ml model is redundant here imho defining probabilities as 51 or 94 doesnt make much sense
344242,exactly this this is why i think it is crazy for teams to set such high apy distributions in the early days of a launch you give the majority of the supply to a handful of degens that are prepared to take the most risk and have little likelihood of sticking around for the long term
344245,and whats the alternative to ml model in that case would be probability just describes the confidence in the forecast in case of llama i believe it was just easier to use some sort of model to describe relationships between the variables rather than manually handcraft estimates or something using model in that case provides scalability and generalization
344246,a reason defi founders have for doing this is that a large spike in tvl at the start creates a massive bug bounty for the protocol and if it doesnt get hacked it signals to everyone that the protocol can be trusted and this trust lasts forever since its an assertion on the security of smart contracts
344247,to clarify our model doesnt predict prices or apy it predicts the probability of the current apy to hold up over a small forward looking window
344248,remember big data protocol
344249,has anyone here kept up with the aftermath of the 80 million dollar bean exploit by chance
344250,tvl apy and protocol name is enough imho aggregated chart looks dope itself why would you need probabilities in there i would rather keen to know whats the averagemedian reatail position size in it
344251,in that case it was something closer to a proof of capital in which the founders traded token supply for marketing
344252,but ser how else number go up
344253,hehe
344254,guys who are in the topic of validation in cosmos is the gitopia project promising in your opinion
344255,like maybe just build a good product dunno though sounds a bit out there now i think about it
344256,how does it do that is the source available somewhere
344258,
344259,this make make it easier to understand we have short sentences explaining how to interpret the algorithm in our pool pages this is the one for the stetheth pool on convex
344260,the algorithm predicts the current apy of 429 to not fall below 343 within the next 4 weeks probability 9900
344262,so you just dont like the feature you can simply dismiss it then i can see people finding it reasonable and using it to not ape into some pools with low probability of apy staying at the same level
344263,as you can see it makes a lot of sense 3 is steth staking apy so its very unlikely that the convex pool which gets extra emissions has had a stable apy for a while and receives trading fees would drop below that apy threshold
344264,im not trying to convince you or anyone else its my friendly opinion in the discussion
344266,the question is is it just between two members or does the situation involve more people my 2 sats are1 open discussion with the person about the topic and problems2 open discussion inside of the team or part of the team in hope to find the solution3 if that doesnt work question is what means toxic like if a person is racist insult others etc i can see how this can be brought up to a bigger crowd possibly if it involves voting u can always first have a call with smaller group of big stakes in dao before making it full on public such as funds whales active contributors etcbut choose wisely with whom you will talk i can easily see how someone that is more oriented on profit then success of protocolcan decide after that call to le dump etc so just think of the way how u wanna present and open discussion always great to get feedback from fellow contributors u trustbefore doing it4 public discussion and voting some people mentioned ens thing as example that goes to that category in some wayhope this helps and i wish you closure that will make the best out of situation
344267,thank you for the thoughtful response
344269,actually saintsal i think you can share some things about core team alignments and general team drama solving hopefully that can help even more
344270,whats the point then sounds redundant
344271,it just makes it easieryou also dont need an apy dashboard since you could just go through the frontend of every single protocol and write down their apy numbers in a paper the purpose of the dashboard is just to make things easier and the purpose of this metric is the sameinstead of having to look at the apy and tvl history of every pool and look at every protocol to see if its likely to sustain that apr you can use our metrics as a heuristic and save yourself a lot of time
344272,our metrics are not some kind of super alpha generating thing they just make your life a little bit easier
344273,or a lot in my case thanks for the hard work peeps
344274,i find it useful too thanks for the dashboard
344275,ah let me clarify that i was mostly referring to the ml part seems less like ml and more proof of agethis is old the rest makes sense though
344276,at its core ml is just identifying patterns which is what this does at this point i think we are just arguing semantics tho
344277,you can check the code tho its open source
344278,i love the new dashboard as i am building a yield optimiser this is perfect for me
344279,congratulations on the launch this is a great step forward in defi
344280,us adds blenderio crypto mixing service to north korean sanctions list
344281,very useful to quantify decay in apy i think that will help many participants to make better decisions thanks for open sourcing the code is the input data used to train models available somewhere
344282,
344283,i think input data is just our own data which we are using on our dashboard atm no api for it we just launched but will build one when we have time
344285,hi can you send me some examples of your work
344287,so were talking about major team conflict as a source of project riski think nemos referring to similar disalignment and communication breakdowns we saw in startups when teams dont know each others personal goals and desirable exits they pull against each other with strategic arguments instead or take issue with communication style the first major sign you see before trying to vote people off the island is zombie mode where team execution gets slowstalled when i was researching daoistrycom i saw this in dao workgroups too people from such diverse backgrounds cultures and communication norms get mushed together into a team leading to tacit disagreements and pulling in different directions they end up seeing other as wrongtoxic if they dont make the effort to get to know each other personally we designed up a bunch of games to flush up these different underlying beliefs and goals understanding empathy turns into peer support alignment in daos it probably makes sense for longterm members and these types of soft systems to foster alignment are emerging in the regen space too a bunch of communities of care projects came up in kernel last block which would probably be useful in defi since they can make conflicts visible and preemptable experienced startup investors tend to look for teams who have good alignment so maybe this can become a factor for defi projects too
344288,i wrote a thread for skeptics like you
344289,thanks still have my doubts this will be reliable in the long run since any ml predictive model is as good as its data are and i can easily see it getting skewedbut good luck and love the work you are doing
344291,i only know about shorting muso borrow oil fund on mirror protocol is there anything else
344292,explore deus finance and their dsynths afaik there is oil synth and you can open short positions their ecosystem dei lending and muon vwap oracle was twice exploited thought take care
344293,kwenta
344295,check out a bigger v1 rollout still not as sexy as v2 thats coming up in a few weeks but gearbox can now offer to short 500k of wbtc or weth onchain use your ftm luna crv ldo as portfolio margin and a bit more some gear rewards are due by dao
344296,i d vouch for them good team innovation in defi has risk
344297,read their post mortem
344298,looking to build a curve clone on a nonevm chain if you can help dm me please and thank you
344300,saber on solana astroport on terra
344301,to clarify i am not looking for curve clonesim looking to build a curve clone on a nonevm chain if you can help answer a few questions about formulas i dont understand i would appreciate it
344303,sorry removed a message by accident alonelydot
344304,mit bitcoin expo 2022 starts today hackathon begins today and the conference tomorrowwill be livestreamed for those who cannot make it but those that come in person have access to all events including kickass afterparty student tickets free
344308,no worries thanks ivan the event is much more open in terms of content this year feel free to check the agenda and get in touch if interested
344309,are there any ways to long 11 nft art without spending 9000eth in whale games in beeplelike auction
344310,find a good artist and buy their work
344311,in this arena nfts still work oldschool
344315,just got this issue today as well
344316,long live crypto
344317,anyone has info about voltzany opinion
344318,
344319,the us government is focused on fighting not just the hackers themselves but also the illicit services they rely on to launder stolen fundsprivacy is illegal
344320,hi
344321,is there any site where we can see the list of grants available or list of grant winners across different chains
344322,my site the common good is the most comprehensive public list of grants and incentives programs i am aware of i have it linked below
344323,just published an article on the counterfactual smartwallet system that revest is now using for value storage looking at the way a central contract for all deposits allowed our system to become insolvent during the march attack on it weve figured out an entirely new paradigm you can predict what address a contract will live at in the future using eip1167 then send the users value to that location for an inaccessible storage location when youre ready to withdraw just use eip1167 to deploy a selfdestructing clone to the address and withdraw the value99 of the time there is no contract living at the address and one deposit will always only map to one address meaning that an attacker can only withdraw as much value as the address associated with his deposit has access to sharing with hopes to inspire others on how to defeat insolvencybased attacks
344324,feel like this needs to talk about gas cost implications especially on ethereum
344325,see thats the trick with eip1167its incredibly cheap maybe 80100k additional gas at mostthis works because we call self_destruct on the cloned smartwallet in the same transaction we deploy it which avoids writing the vast majority of its state to storage
344326,
344327,compare with this transaction which cost 200k gas vs the 160k you see there both withdrawals and deposits got cheaper because we no longer have to keep careful track of rebase tokens
344328,how come meshswap has a single verified contract on polygonscan
344332,
344333,
344335,its crazy how you need a team to keepup with defi tons of valid protocols day by day
344336,twittercomofficer_ciastatus1522596588614561794
344337,just hire an osinter for it sir
344338,epic well deserved
344339,thank u3 making a blockchain subculture a better place together fam
344340,how to quickly identify a project to never ever touch
344341,hey gang im honestly curious about this so would love 2 sats links etc lived there before web3 life but honestly not impressed nor wowed by bay area in web3 space so wanna understand am i ignorant or
344342,interesting idea thank you for sharing
344346,you have token with governance rights over treasury that treasury accrues through initial liquidity ohm bonds etc now team just removes the governance rights from the token and uses the treasury as they wish anyone know if that is in any way legal i know its like a really stupid question in that regard as almost nothing is properly defined in law and crypto but it just feels super wrong
344347,question is too general depends on the details of the countrylaw in question the details of exactly what they did and whether they breached promises etc and even if it is legal it may not be easy get any kind of legal remedy
344348,
344349,i recommend this bot sers
344350,or multisenderapp
344351,does somebody know mmfinance team contacts theyve been hacked recently and gspdnsobaka with me have probably established the identity of hacker and we want to forward this info to legal structuresproject its urgent and we need them to reach out to us appreciate help fam
344352,disperse doesnt charge a fee for usage
344353,charging a fee for that app is just criminal
344354,hey guys had anyone ever transferred their poaps i get this error with unftwalletxyz and same one with eporio any idea how to fix this it happens only with one specific poap others are transferrable with no issues
344355,what does projects usually do with their idle treasury funds just throw in yearnrari
344356,id like a word with any dao that puts treasury funds in rari
344357,i guess most of daosprojects just sit on it
344358,has there been any threads posted on this topic
344359,i searched for treasury just found a lot of unrelated stuff
344360,farm42 my last hope
344361,its like are you okay with your dao going belly up if something gets hacked
344362,thats ultimately what it boils down to if its acceptable risk then do whatever
344363,if you have limited risk tolerance but dont want the funds to just sit start from the most conservative yield generating protocols
344364,were working on something
344365,you mean something like that arxivorgpdf220206541pdf
344366,most of the time you cant deploy your native tokens but weve got something in dev to change that
344367,thinking of something more anecdotal for now
344368,convincing maker to let you use your native token as collateral
344369,we put a portion of ours to work with iceth and other yield bearing strategies
344370,no locking and how to decided on sizing
344371,better taking out loans never a good idea however there are some very good ways to utilize native treasuries with low risk methodologies that most people havent put together yet
344372,were still in relative stealth with it so forgive me for being scant on details time value of money is something most people dont think much about however
344373,sounds cool
344374,weve got a finance team that makes those decisions internally led by
344375,and a dao treasury team that helps others
344376,ah ok thx
344377,thanks a lot great effort i found some other site dstackxyz but they are not updating it regularly
344378,you can check out how karpatkey is utilizing gnosis dao funds they share weekly reports on gnosis forum
344379,they follow a pretty good diversification strategy imo
344380,oh damn potential alpha
344381,thx

344388,if it aint at least 75mm too small for maker
344389,looking for projects unique to l1l2 that are impossible to replicate on the mainnet because of fees or the speed of the network appreciate any recommendations
344390,any derivatives project
344392,alpaca finance automated vaults
344393,arent those a yearn fork
344394,nope thats leverage lp farming
344395,yearn doesnt have the leverage aspect
344396,its a pseudo delta neutral automated strategy for leverage yield farming
344397,tkstanczak hinted that doing onchain gas derivatives is impossible and requires starknet stuff cause computations r too expensive i might have paraphrased wrong
344399,i think amm with solidly bilidly models would not work on ethereum because the 001 fee ie nearly zero fee on swap would be not relevant if you pay 80 for your swap except for very large swaps
344400,while not requiring speed of network rarity from ac and extensions built on base game aka composable nft architecture would be much painful for user and achieve less auditory with 10ish fees to interact
344401,soso not l2 gnosis chain
344402,o fantom
344403,oh sorry i didnt notice
344404,poap base data management
344405,i guess you can add tarot to that then on fantom
344406,tarot doesnt take two opposite lyf positions and auto rebalance them at best it will start you out with a delta neutral position and you can rebalance manually
344407,lyf exists on mainnet alpha finance did it first i believe
344408,thx for the info will try alpaca
344409,alpaca finance bnbftm savings vaults are coming soon which will auto rebalance keep you at a 1x position on btcethbnb while using up to 8x leverage to yield farm essentially high apy single asset staking
344410,epic thats nice especially in these times
344411,zkmoney
344412,cant wait for defi inside aztec
344413,anything gaming related
344414,might be a bit biased and earlybut we are building a gamefi with upgradable and modular nfts together with an expanding world that integrates other projects and their rewards into our protocol
344415,i was preparing a game where l2 was used as part of the improvements for some starting territoriesthat is the gameplay lives on the air but the user starts in l2 and then can choose before the fight if pvp it is important where he wants to conduct a transaction in case of victory there are budget quests scenarios and fights at some point on the player becomes not expensive to use the airwaves because the cost of profit from the battle is several times higher than the cost of the transaction
344416,do you have cats among the characters hehe ive decided to start integrating with other vendors through connecting all possible cats in defi collecting tasks with cats in the backlog
344417,elk is a bridge that uses only its token to transfer liquidity between many chainsi also saw the bridge rather it was an mvp theres exactly l2l2 delivery
344418,and what exactly is the question of your search
344419,ow god noi hate cats xd and nfts in general
344420,you can be understood and i consider nft not as content first of all but as a container a folder with files and the ability to execute code on this flash drive and can also respond to environmental events can have attached similar or other specifications tokenized elements insidein the sense that nft is a primitive that can be used very well in construction
344421,yepthat is why we are integrating as much utility as possible into them like nfts as access cards single use items together with more infrastructure related stuff
344423,dont bet against elon
344424,hell i get error msg sorry connected wallet does not have enough tokens to join lobsterdao kingdom for any queries please contact group admin where tokens
344425,mmmmm maybe not
344426,not sure if they reached out already forwarded this message to their team so they can contact either of you guys
344427,guys you realize trading fees are tax deductible right
344428,0 fees is a scam
344429,wait really
344430,hi any admin cant join
344431,not exactly i believe the swap functions are optimised so comparing solidlys xyk pools to uniswaplike you got both lower fees and possibly lower gas costcomparing solidlys stable pools to curve they got lower fees and lower gas cost for execution but the liquidity is concentrated much much lower so any reasonably sized swap on mainnet would incur much higher slippage which will outweight all the feesgas savings
344432,only nft holders can join use the collab land invite link in there to do so
344434,sorry connected wallet does not have enough tokens to join lobsterdao kingdom for any queries please contact group admin
344435,ser you need lobsterdao nft links are on github so collab land can verify you you can find that on looksrare opensea etc links also on github
344436,ok great thanks sorry i thought this was an airdrop for coinlist hoilders i see now its vice verse what purpose does the lobsterdao nft serve
344437,make the world a better place
344438,it gives you access to the best shitposting group in all of telegram hopefully some alpha as well there have been several perks announced for nft holders
344439,we should maybe talk
344440,dming
344441,sure
344443,anyone know how secure is mesh
344444,what is the cost of registering a three letter ens domain after its expired
344445,600 usd per yr
344446,the same regular price then
344447,yeah should be
344448,depends on how long after it has expired
344449,check the ens discord or even their documentation its kind of detailed and different than you would think
344450,say after the grace period and premium period is expired
344452,yeah 600 per year in eth then whatever gas fees are
344456,the contracts are unverified so nobody really knows
344457,and everyone farming it
344458,fomo first complain about the devs rugginggetting rekt later
344459,its on the devs side to assure security though there will always be usersdevs asymmetry in knowledge and skills
344461,asymmetry is irrelevant unless youre being forced to use the thing
344462,anybody running a pocket nework node happy with it any tips before i begin
344463,me and other plebs i know are using services to stake but iicc1 might have their own
344465,unless something changed in the last 24 hrs im pretty sure not a single person that has money in that stuff saw a gun manifest above their heads forcing them to put money in but im pretty sure itll be emn 20 with the blaming should something happen
344466,asymmetry is relevant as your decision making process is a tad more complex than magical free will its like saying its okay to scam people werent force to buy after all which is wrong at many levels
344467,meh that it isnt okay to scam doesnt absolve you of personal responsibility
344468,not sure why youd expect to see fewer scams when the market twists themselves into pretzels excusing their provisioning of a market for scammers
344469,yeah but are we looking at blaming people or at systemic solutions beside you cant expect everyone to know about what a contract is and how to read it etc when they start we all started with 0 knowledge your speech about personal responsibility is all good but wont help solving anything
344470,you can blame both the people that think its a good idea to fomo first and ask questions later hence providing a market for scammers and the scammers there are no saints here
344471,youre taking the problem the wrong way its not about blaming its about acknowledging the reality of interactions so they can be engineered differently and users can be protected and builders too
344472,imo
344473,you cant expect everyone to know about what a contract is and how to read it etc when they start we all started with 0 knowledgeor you could stay away from things you dont understand and when you dont know better than to chuck the blame on somebody else
344474,you never understand something fully and you can also overestimate your knowledge which shouldnt lead to catastrophy moreover some stuffs are being learned only by doing its the case in crypto generally at least form my empirical experience not only theory can teach
344475,doesnt really contradict what ive said
344476,anyway lets agree to disagree
344477,guys who knows there are projects similar to gitopia are they the only ones who want to overshadow github and make a separate platform for web3 code
344478,radicle comes closest to mind
344479,if you want to try it out start here
344480,guys is there some tool or service that allows to track token emissions just by feeding it smart contract address all i can think of is dune but it require extra steps and big brain
344481,we run a bunch of them and provide pocket node as a service as well good docs for retail self hosted node runner here
344482,anybody know if meshswap is safe
344483,i have eth rpc from pocket which constantly fails with different apps using metamask
344484,yeah we monitor pocket apis from user perspective as well and performance hasnt been great
344485,nan
344486,eg response times
344487,screenshot
344489,ust
344490,im long lol
344491,ye i am just adding shit to fire but tbh i dont see anything new in whats people are saying
344492,yes the curve pool is 70 now but thats nothing too bad either
344493,yeah it will recover its just the same fud as usdn i believe
344494,its so iliquid on binance for such mc
344495,500k gets it to 099
344496,yup exactly
344497,related
344498,nan
344499,130m down since the twitter post btw
344500,do i panic sell or what
344501,the peg is still fine as high curve a holds it
344502,imho i dont see this depeging for long
344503,its luna thats in trouble if anything
344504,if you dont actually believe in do kwon and shenanigans crazy stuff of lfg then yes otherwise nothing new
344505,you cant believe its some systemic risk blabla at this point if you never thought anything was wrong before
344506,if you did not then just ignore this imho
344507,kinda same as wavesusdn
344508,yes unless they decide to dump their btc too i dont know how it works tbh
344509,selling discounted luna to funds has been the play so far
344510,but as the market moves lower and lower this isnt gonna do the trick
344511,the path of least resistance is both the luna mcap and the ust supply shrinking the way i see it
344512,unless the tide that lifts all boats comes back before that
344515,crypto is not interesting enough to get taken out by an cult stablecoin depegging
344516,not like this
344517,not like this
344518,i object sercult stablecoin depegging would be a very interesting eventand prehaps would make the perfect final cleanup
344519,justin sun will save us
344520,i dont think us need to be saved
344521,i think it will impact whole market
344522,yes that is what i would like to see
344523,
344524,though maybe it desire to see how it evolves is coming from just finished watching the witcher
344525,using orderbook screenshots to prove something is kinda stupid though
344526,its like the account that tried to show defi is illiquid by screenshotting large orders slippage on metamask
344527,
344531,lobsterdao closed chat was discussing this ser good luck with walking though zeroblocks not a convo for here really
344543,wtf is this
344546,there were some qs on edge
344566,wtf is this
344567,apocalypsis fud
344568,
344569,
344576,more cool videos like this one are coming3
344577,read how to behave in a thunderstorm if you are worried this is a normal thing happening from time to time this is ok and happened a lot of times over last 50 years thats one of nikola teslas legendaryunrealistic inventions idea is to use this electricity for human needs he prob knew about it before official discoveryenmwikipediaorgwikischumann_resonances
344578,just wow
344584,nice stuff i can understand the emphysics ionosphere behaving like a resonator and chemistry side but not as much the geological and astronomical side and when i think about what op was alluding to who tf know what is going on at any point in time with the earth sun or whatever so when these deviations occur its like another thing to point towards that can freak people out and thus investors follow
344585,yeah for sure agree here thats basically a psyops just followed up
344586,oh sure got it i wasnt calling anything a psyop or anything like that in truth there is a non zero probability of serious geological and or cosmic event predicted at any time in history according to measurement said predictive measurement is taken into a consideration framework which can take the fear of unknown variable into it as a function and output as an explained away by a dataset andor historical reference to a set of corelated dataset where to be not shit that look worthy of freaking out but rather everything turned out to be fine but also who knows if how metaphysics are playing out in human history for sure outofnorm feedbacks put into put back into the market are part of the basis of reflexivity theory or perhaps something more exciting ahem
344589,theres a really ridiculous scammer in this channel she claims to be a lady from quebec she established contract to me 3 weeks ago with some chitchat and started with trying to scan me yesterday everybody take care
344591,kwenta deprecated oil along with stocks and other low volume synths as per
344592,nothing burger
344594,in case it gets deleted
344596,removing dumb ust takes basic questions there is nothing new literally 3 people controlling it all and u trust them thats it its not objectively bad u do u its just different pools for now have been mostly restored thats all
344597,proposal allow lobsterdao nft holders to post gifs
344598,
344599,haha think thats a big administrative burden ser unless you publish some code to do so
344600,would do it for a lob
344601,buy a lob and do that in kingdom chat
344602,this privileges come after u pay fuckers dd
344603,ive got lobs diamond hands here ser
344606,is badger wbtc cafe bridge discontinued
344607,i cant find it in the app chris_hodl
344608,gib me back the bridge
344609,maxroszko now
344610,yeah it was supposed to be on appbadgercombridge
344611,404
344612,well you can use renvm and then swap on curve for wbtc no
344613,i want to send wbtc to boomer chain
344614,then wbtc renbtc renvm
344615,complex gib ui button
344618,cringe
344622,anywhere i can look at lusd health and whats brewing there
344623,
344624,is dis safu
344625,think its getting upgraded meanwhile 1 get renbtc 2 swap to wbtc
344626,hey guys is there a possibility to backup my seed phrase in near wallet sender wallet has this function but near wallet seems not
344627,
344628,farm42
344629,
344630,why balancer tho is there some brr going on rn
344631,yeh ve tokenomics or something
344632,oaksprout
344633,y u tagging people u weirdo
344634,surprising dao dont put more in bancor they could avoid il and single stake
344635,haha because we wrote it ser answer re balancer is that were not sure looking into it potentially custom pool weights
344636,fiatdao launch balancer pool recent and there were bribing actions all around
344637,gnosis holds a ton of bal they can vote rewards to the pools theyre farming
344638,biggest question for me is why treasury assets actively earning yield is so low
344639,cause they r mostly in native shitcoins and native shitcoins have no avenues to earn yield
344640,hack risk is one factor i think balancer had funds on rari lost to the hack chasing yield is hardly worth it
344641,skews the number a lot but even the blue chip assets see low deployment
344642,must be still seems disproportionately low though
344643,gnosis employed a treasury management firm in karpatkey to look after their funds from memory im not sure other daos are really that far along other than just funds sitting in multisigs with no dedicated treasury management team
344644,interesting 30d net apy fees il is negative 39 04 since inception
344645,this is a very interesting convo dao treasury management is such a hyped word for the last 1year which is used in every product pitch yet nobody has achieved anything in this regard apart from some random yearn aave deposits and then gnosis being active the rest are idle af
344646,i asked this question like yesterday boss
344647,at least for balancer our initial goal is establish a 2yr runway in stables and after cost of insurance its not worth farming with those funds in our view so it will be awhile before we start investing in yield bearing treasury assets though that is the ultimate goal we do have some steth and a few lps on balancer but only 3m total
344648,interesting so youll build up your reserves and then start farming on the excess when youve got that cushion sounds sensible makes sense
344649,nan
344650,yeah best minds theorizing how this could actually work seem to hang out around gnosis
344651,looks like theres a way to regenerate a forgotten seed which seems to match your case
344652,you can get to that page via the wallet then helpdesk and type in is that possible to change the seed phrase on my near walletif you dont want to trust the link
344653,i already made a new wallet address cause its much faster thanks though
344654,
344655,they dump eth on us
344656,and there are no reflections on buysells only holders rekt not sellers
344657,i think your seed phrase should not be stored in any online format
344658,just read this mirrorxyzofficerciaethgtknkmrdr_hhcqrnsenjqfpdhhb0w1m2svexdp4swcq
344661,wallets are just interfaces
344667,any way crypto already has deep sp books somewhere wanna kop
344668,
344669,kayne were sorry about those twitter fights pls come back
344670,i think uma activley doing treasure management with in house team
344674,
344675,i keep forgetting what was the trick to make importjson0current_pricenot repurt error getting data every time
344676,for excel
344678,hmmm theres a trick
344679,im like refreshing for 50 times
344680,yes i do that but i remember somebody said there is some hardcoded thing in command which makes refreshing not needed
344681,unless i am imagining things already
344682,that would be awesome this refreshing thing is quite annoying
344683,trick was to use a timestamp formula at the end of the url so itd fetch again as the timestamp updated not sure if that works anymore
344686,i literally started developing something for treasury management a few months back through an ultranovel and lowrisk vector it is very exciting to me that this a conversation that were starting to have just now as the core code is nearing completion
344687,do u have copy paste smth blz i can use
344689,
344690,why dont they name it
344691,the attack lasting less than 15 seconds targeted a cloudflare customer on the professional pro plan operating a crypto launchpad crypto launchpads are used to surface decentralized finance projects to potential investors i think premint was recently attacked but i doubt that it was that big
344692,how does that answer the question
344693,it doesntassumed that the question implies that u are interested to know what was that platformpresumably security measures maybe idk
344694,i want to flag that after 1 bumpy year 0xdev0 just rugged his project wild credit and tornado cashed 100e a bit of shame that after building a useful protocol where you could use uni v3 lp positions as collateral he decided to wipe out all the liquidity and the fame he earned
344695,why would they expose a client they are supposed to protect
344696,a bit of shame that after building a useful protocol where you could use uni v3 lp positions as collateral he decided to wipe out all the liquidite and the fame he earned isnt that playing fast and loose with the reality of how things were going
344699,running a single pocket node is not very profitable since you need to run nodes from other networks too profitability scales by running many pocket nodes because you connect them with the same full nodesthis dashboard is very useful to check the most profitable networks to connect to your pocket node
344700,
344701,dead threat cause buying twitter
344702,this was the original use case dont let ivan gaslight you
344703,the interesting part isnt who the attack was against but the specific datacenters hetzner online gmbh autonomous system number 24940 and ovh in france asn 16276these two datacenters host alot of nodes for ethereum and other chains too
344704,wondering if more to it or just coincidence
344705,it was threats from the russia space agency for helping provide ukraine internet
344706,attack was against gempad
344707,is there any study on systematic liquidations in defi in the event of a ust or other major stablecoin collapsewide depegging as well as the shortterm consequences in a closed form solution
344708,so he handled the keys to the dao as he did for his previous project build finance did he dump his stake andor leave with the treasury or he just left the project
344709,dxdao has also got an inhouse person managing the treasury
344711,im trying to find medical web3crypto projects the search doesnt show me much info are you aware of some interesting ones more focused on devicesmlai instead clinical record
344712,just offtopic but incentivized mrixray labelling comes to my mind and may actually be noice
344713,molecule may be of interest to you
344714,some weeks ago 0xdev took a 300 eth loan using their wild stash as collateral at an insane borrow rate as there were little liquidity to dump on the ethwild uniswap pair which they sent straight to tornado the community was able to make 0xdev repay and close the loan as the it was exposing the eth suppliers to the risk of bad debt but then few days ago 0xdev dumped their wild stash straight to the open market and quit for good
344715,thks i knew vita_dao but not molecule desci is very interesting i hope to find more projects that are devices related my field of expertise other than biotech
344716,this sounds exciting vfat0 any eta
344717,sad to hear had a lot of respect for him since early algo stable days but i guess you get tired of launching project after project with no traction first basis gold and build now this
344718,
344719,update
344720,posted an announcement saying that the project was moving to a dao seconds after that dumped all his stack leaving the people who were supplying wild in the ethwild pair without the possibility of paying back their debt and nuked the price a 90
344721,nan
344722,substratum inverse feels bad man
344723,bought top and start selling few days later
344724,
344725,are they trying to psyops usdd here
344726,frenz are there real usecasesprojects using erc4626 already
344727,fuse
344728,yearn v3 vaults are erc4626 but i am not sure if they are already launched
344729,not launched yet yes
344730,this is interesting as the karpatekey founder was the in house gnosis treasury manager when spin off
344731,is slowmist considered a good security audit firm
344732,they are pretty excellent
344733,i think the team definitely has good security experience but not sure about their service or cost
344734,no ive never heard of them
344735,and ive hired about seven audit firms
344736,is the code available already
344737,gm lobsters
344738,im gonna repeat whats said in the kingdom chat here as not everyone migrated there yet
344739,if youve already got lobs nft by mar 20 and deposited into gro labs and held onto your deposit for 2 weeks as of apr 30 youd see a seafood airdrop in gro rewards centre at
344740,the airdrop does not go directly into your wallet you have to claim them
344741,there was no minimum requirements for deposits as wed like to more people to try out labs and tell us what you think
344742,for those who get the airdrop itll show up like this
344743,and then you have to make a choice to join in on vesting or cash out 30 giving up 70 to those who decide to vest
344744,more details in the new lobster kingdom chat so if youre holding lobs please hop over to read up
344745,mstable is upgrading their save contracts into 4626 and there is also the meta vaults
344747,also
344748,yes
344749,not exactly but close
344750,v2 vaults are compatible as are bentobox vaults
344751,a well known firm that does risk analysis for major projects is launching an offering similar cant say name tho
344752,for sure
344756,thorswap moved their thor staking to vthor which is 4626 a few days ago
344757,not yet
344758,no
344761,yearn v3 is getting into tranches interesting
344762,tranche products in defi ended up not good before would like to see how yearn is going to make a difference
344763,
344764,yea unlike in tradfi nobody want senior tranches in defi
344765,they will do it well not get hackedprobably and not abandon the project to make more shitcoins like barnbridge
344766,maybe they should have degen trache and junior tranche for those less degens
344767,lmao sounds not bad
344768,thats the whole point of the tranches
344769,pffff
344770,eh lets not pretend too much that he wasnt the primary userbagholders were excited the numba was finally going up and the protocol being usedbagholders started complaining when they realized dev was pretty much the only one bootstrapping the protocol because oh noes y u send borrow money to tornadodev tells them y not also supposedly killing two birds with one stone by avoiding dumping tokens on market and bootstrapping or would you rather i dump guess they didnt pay attention to this one bagholders continue to complaindev dumps wild to repay the money for the numba they were excited about had to come from somewhere after all bagholders stunned dev was primary user as tvl and apy plummets after repaymentbagholders start making suggestions about how maybe it wasnt so bad dev was bootstrappingdev should consider doing things for bagholders including pivoting to help numba go up again because quelle surprise hardly anyone is using appi left the chat at this point dev nopes out everything has been built after all giving the complainers what they want
344771,time to bring it back to the bases graphorginterviewwithahackerwhoneverhackedanyonegrandtheftbitcoin0508
344772,farm42 ser is there a bloxy like app for bsc or other evm blockchains
344773,try using tenderlyco or twittercomtryethernal or find a good service here graphorgtxanalysistools0419
344774,
344775,lobsters doing public goods if any ppl want to contribute to help keep this big list of all grants updated pls contact me or sovsignal or just contributoooor i guess
344776,he was the main user due to the accounting bug in the previous iteration of the protocol which led to 12m of losses and little to no development in the last 3 monthsyou can draw it as you want but at the end of the day he was paying a non sustainable on his wild and instantly taken out deposited eth and tornado cashing that amount of wild was impossible to liquidate as there wasnt enough liquidity to support itfinally dump all your tokens abandon the project and framed it as helping the project and making it communityowned is just unreal
344777,hi lobsters lebed2045 advised me to post a message here about my defi project apologies in advance if i am breaking some nonwritten rulei am a former ee researcher and i have been developing for more than 1 year this small defi project probably the best highlevel introduction is this threadin this order of preference i am trying to raise some capital to pay for audits other expense before launch looking for a frontend dev or anyone else that wants to help the project in other aspects like marketing community management etc even potentially a cofounder
344778,just a scammer he withdrew before public the bug
344779,main user duehow did an accounting bug prevent bagholders from using the appas for drawing well the implicit admission that your earlier comment about fame and useful app was a story is certainly refreshing
344780,you can draw it as you want but at the end of the day he was paying a non sustainable on his wild and instantly taken out deposited eth and tornado cashingso the bagholders that werent using the app until he did claimed and changed their minds about after he repaid because oh noes y tvl and apy dump having never answered if they would prefer he simply sell the tokens so i guess he answered it for them but unsurprisingly they dont like that eitherbut at this point im just repeating myself
344781,what you get when you confuse token holders and randoms in a chat for people that are going to use what youre building might seem duh obvious but token holders are not users
344782,lets assume this simplistic take is true as a thought experiment would that also apply to btc being lent out in defi creating more supply pushing the price down
344783,its illegal to rehypothocate customer deposits unless they agree to the terms he doesnt know what hes talking about hes just farming likes with dumb content plus even if exchanges were conducting illegal lending services which they arent because they are all regulated there still is a counter party in all of this which makes it a net long
344785,any feedback even if just about the tweet storm would be greatly appreciated
344786,keeping btc on an exchange is a bad call though all the samejust ask about my mtgox deposits
344787,always great to see people building probably not the best place to get feedback maybe try dming people you are specifically interested in hearing from
344788,thanks for the advise i am not picky anyone whos interested in the project and can contribute in any shape or form is welcome
344789,irene zhaos influencer platform socol is raising funds at a 100 million valuation
344790,
344791,when compound defi llc
344792,ahh shit here we go again
344793,99 at binance currently yeah
344794,paulo nice to see you here
344795,codonyat long time no see
344796,we miss you over the rats chats
344797,
344798,tldr
344799,block collider 4 lief
344800,do this and ur claims of fe hack will mean actual negligence not cop out
344801,too gigabrain for me but i believe with those allowlists exploits where the bad guy sends bad data through an api can be avoided by checking the chain
344802,ty
344803,i believe they started looking at those kinds of ways to protect users after badgers website exploit they also describe a possible improvement to block malicious transactions in case of someone hacks the website if wallet providers like mm also checks the chain to stop users from signing malicious transactions
344804,this is why were all becoming poorer
344806,susd is overcollateralized
344808,url blz
344809,susd is mostly backed by eth and lusd the snx backed portion is pretty well overcollateralized its not close to the ust model at all
344810,does anyone the maven11 guys
344811,not sure if maven11 frens are here but they did feature another project that discussed credit risk in its amsterdam event so theyve probably thought about credit risk assessment even if its part of building out investment case
344812,following up on earlier message on gro airdrop for lobsters who tested labs before apr 30
344813,ust depegging again 25 atm
344815,is anyone part of thelao here if so please check active voting on discord
344816,2 you gotta check the wormhole ust3crv pool on curve on ethereum
344817,thats what defines the price deepest liquidity for ust
344818,we havent set up a proper website yet but you can check our discord
344819,it has happened
344820,ust luna
344821,someone seems to keep bidding right around 98
344822,so uh is there a rekt simulator which helps me see how much i am getting rekt for in total when i get liquidated on oasis
344823,0
344824,oasis as in maker

344829,1 btc 1 btc
344830,press green button
344831,ust back below
344832,hope btc wont follow eth example
344833,vitalik needs to start shitposting on twitter more this is what happens when he doesnt
344834,is he referring to steth
344835,its a shit post dont think its real
344836,thought that deepest liquidity was in terra not in ethereum
344837,yep
344838,hold forever homie
344839,jump depegging eeefff to save yu ass tee
344840,look for your cdp theres also a dashboard on defisaver
344841,hi sers is there a website where i can check the treasuries of daos like maker uni etc
344842,ill just leave it here sound on
344843,you mean this one sir openorgsinfo
344844,please show your magic wand sir
344845,thanks ser
344846,thats not accurate for eg maker you can find better info here
344847,lal looks great want to go to the hp studios too soon goblin town stop stealing all toucans values
344848,done
344849,nan
344850,joyceyyc why unpeg madam
344851,just noticed
344852,can someone recommend a reliable platform for no code minting nfts on eth
344853,hm none of these tell me how much i will lose if i hit the liq price
344854,start or the end of the goblin town
344855,ah you wanna predicthard to tell due to the dutch auction model you will lose at least 13 penalty and the rest will be depending on market price if youre worried also keep a good eye on the osm price it is not always 11 with the market
344856,assuming this is it its just your oracle thats depegging
344857,13 of what though i am trying to find out i keep reading the docs but it is not straightforward wish there was an example with numbers
344858,hm thats seems coingecko issue
344859,joyceyyc
344860,ah thats because coingecko doesnt count curve pool
344861,nan
344862,most of pwrd liquidity is on curve we used to have a pwrdgro pool on uniswap v2 but the liquidity was thin and so only used for arbs
344863,theres also a bug in the ust minter contract
344864,peak fud how low will the peg go
344865,samkazemian ser jumping out of pool 4 or nah and staying course
344866,of your debt if you generated 1000 dai the auction has to raise up to 1130 dai by selling your collateral
344867,well 4pool hadnt really started up yet but we are staying the course with ust i believe in do its important to note that frax is as unaffected by the contents of 4pool as usdc is namely it does not directly matter to us if a specific stablecoin depegs frax is safe
344868,on that topic relevant
344869,this why i big fraximalist d
344870,nice
344871,thank u for the reply and info ser
344872,except for lpers still true
344873,lps bear the risk correct so the yield must be proportional to the risk the market deems by lps but from a protocol perspective frax is as unbothered and safe as usdc is in the 4pool
344874,
344875,wtf
344876,ust is at 92c
344877,wew lad
344878,no way
344879,what
344880,
344881,nan
344882,nan
344883,those who leave early are saved but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time so that everyone keeps asking what time is it what time is it but none of the clocks have any hands
344884,
344885,
344886,f off dude stop selling aaa
344887,nan
344888,this ponzi gonna ruin whole crypto ponzi for a while will it how much more btc do they have
344889,reserve is empty
344890,
344891,sams ready to buy that 15b
344892,this hasnt confirmed yet so it wasnt sold yet if i am watching this correctly
344893,but the reserve was total 35b isnt it
344894,bot after market sell of 15b programmedthen we fly
344895,figure people are hedging in anticipation of the sale
344896,it has 2 confirmations
344897,
344898,just the btc reserve
344899,which is still a lot of sell pressure on the rest of the market
344902,
344903,are other curve pools like 3crv contaminated by ust risk or is the risk isolated in the ust pool
344904,this isnt anything like black thursday
344905,different market structures we cant go back to thenonly 1 bn of stables sloshing around back then
344906,sure but that was a one time event
344907,buy the dip
344908,ser
344909,what
344910,
344911,not correct
344912,it actually touched that on binance
344913,also no new block in goerli for 6 hours and a half f
344914,does the network lag
344916,muditg you know something about this just saw through defillama you have a public rpc endpoint
344919,it turns out holding a reserve currency to defend a peg that dictates the price action for all other assets including yours was not a smart idea
344921,i suppose 3crv has deep enough liquidity in all other pools combined to be swayed by this
344922,no busy watching my ust vaults getting liquidated right now
344923,no pleb comments redacting
344924,hollyfolly gl ser
344926,is the chainlink price feed page working for everyone
344927,
344928,it doesnt show any numbers for me
344929,it has been down for me for last 15 minutes
344930,nothing
344931,same
344932,says something when the oracle api is overloaded
344933,everyones looking at the same thing
344934,if you want to watch the depeg fun
344935,what else left in the reserve
344936,my hopeexpectation as well
344937,maybe mim pool since they have a lot of ust
344938,id say unlikely to spread otherwise
344939,microstrategy under avg price right now
344940,
344941,
344943,where do you guys see any ust contagion hitting first
344944,those tweets from do kwon aged badly i love chaos i will destroy usdt why do things like that when youre in this position
344945,luna 1st and then the entire market jump and kwon then has to force to sell their positions in sol btc eth and other l1s
344946,90 ust will go back to 1 tho
344947,why would ust possibly go back to 1 if they have to sell all their reserves seems like either they catch it now or it nukes hard
344948,daodude agree i also dont really like that but it turns our that total transparency is likely not a way most daos can pratcially operate have said that on many places and will say it here again happy to put any gno holder in contact with that team
344949,ust market cap is higher than luna
344950,once the luna liquidity is dry and the btc reserve is gone theres nothing to stop ust from going to 0
344951,nope ust fdnv is 18bn vs 34bn
344952,yeah exactly itll go into the same infinite inflation tailspin that iron finance did
344953,how does luna price looks at this scenario
344954,were all pleb speculating but they dont have to sell they probably will get a line of credit extended to them in usdt which they can use to defened the peg the threat of defending the peg will bring in front runners who already have closed to gap on dos words he might not even have to use any of the btc if done correctly
344955,demand for terra blockspace right luna 1 probably has ignorant buy pressure if terra has users outside of anchor
344956,luna
344957,it was 34b now its 16
344958,fully diluted vs non fully diluted isnt important the point here is that if you wanted to liquidate every luna out there right now to defend the peg luna would hit 0 before you could do so usts peg is a function of the btc reserves and luna liquidity you can measure the reserves but liquidity is harder to measure liquidity and market cap arent necessarily linked
344959,no the fully diluted is 34bn pal
344960,why would you possibly use fully diluted for an imminent implosion
344961,yes this is how banks work as well
344962,banks dont have to sell their stock to prevent a bank run
344963,a good example of market cap and liquidity not being linked is the chia coin launch there was 0 liquidity on any exchange so the marketcap rocketed up to 500m if someone actually tried to sell 10m worth of chia it would have crashed the price to 0
344964,of course in that hypothetical scenario things go to shit the fdnv does matter because outside of this hypothetical scenario there is longevity in the project and a twice the buffer people are making it out to be
344965,have you not heard of fractional reserve banking
344966,
344967,kind of interesting thought are they better off not defending the peg at all let it drop waaaay down then use their reserves to buy ust and arb at least that way something might be left afterwards
344968,noice
344969,jaja
344970,lol of course i have have you heard of the mexican peso crisis
344971,because thats literally whats happening
344972,every bank in the world runs on this basis in your hypothetical scenario the entire banking system is screwed as well just pointing that out
344974,guys hes starting to understand
344975,heres another reference crisis
344976,the banking system is as fundamentally flawed as this particular algostable is
344977,nan
344978,
344979,dylan leclair on twitter novogratz is on bloomberg tv right now saying the fed should step in he also recently got a luna tattoo twitter
344980,the problem is banks get bailed out by nations printer tho in crypto your best bet is a printer ran by 13 dudes
344981,you cant make this shit up d
344982,anyone know why fei is depegged
344983,guys probably a dumb question but is it worth selling the ust now or is it make no sense this is my first time in this situation
344984,depends you think its going to zero
344985,coingecko is reporting bad data across the whole stablecoin market
344986,here comes the burning question
344987,imma interesting who buy ust right now am
344988,hard to tell i doubt were gonna all ust holders sell not full bankrun scenario
344989,im buying rn on ftx
344990,if the reserves are empty the only thing that saves ust is billion dollar funds coming in to throw money at it
344991,ah okay good i like fei ust nuking always seemed inevitable with the recursive structure but would hate fei going down with it
344992,deep bids down to 070
344993,i dont know 0 is unlikely but 085 i somehow believe and thats a normal kind of loss i dont know really thats why im asking more experienced people for advice
344994,tbh most of the stablecoins were going to get gutted through dex aggregation but just for a short period of time
344995,most of the stables had a ton of volatility today
344996,id free up the cash to buy the dip on btc etc when do dumps all over those to try and save ust
344997,ever crypto catastrophe is unique if you think lower buyin at 085 easy 15 returnif you think crashtozero dont
344998,save ust dump btc
344999,theres not going to be enough
345000,vpepo slightly off but holding up well considering the day
345001,how much new supply of luna has already been minted in the last few hours any dashboard to watch it
345002,or does the minting not occur until all btc etc reserves have been liquidated although i dont really see how thatd work since the reserves are centralized
345003,not sure if this is real time though
345004,ive only found but it updates daily
345005,whoever has debt denominated in ust might be interested
345006,and here i thought shorting usdt was the play
345007,im surprised that the ust supply hasnt shrunk more yet
345008,youd think thered be arb bots buying it and burning it but its only down 600m
345009,arent daily redemptions long capped how could it do anything but devalue right now if im missing something
345010,ohh are they wow yeah thats even worse then
345011,this
345012,luna price down 30 in the last 24h for only 600m decrease in supply of ust
345013,
345014,so lfg must just be buying straight ust and not burning it then supply wont change
345015,that says 100m ust per day but it seems more in the range of 50m
345016,yea thats my understanding
345017,wait so how would we have a 600m decrease today according to cmc
345018,never mind im an idiot
345019,thats because of the 7 dip p
345020,the price is down lol
345021,everyone bashing luna shoulda sold at the top luna went up few hundred x this past year so average cost is very low for many vulnerable to huge drop
345022,look at what people paid to see how big the potential drop
345023,so effectively right now while the cap is maxed out luna has no stability mechanism at all besides lfg
345024,usdtust on kucoin has a 01 spread amazing that market makers keep operating in this environment
345025,arbitrageurs if they r still interested
345026,from what i remember from early 2018 liquidity was much worse during a crisis
345027,arb what though
345028,there is no market to arbitrage
345029,trust and faith
345031,
345033,literally this only since the few milly that were able to exit the market through luna were from whales normal users are getting 7 chop on their deposits
345034,nan
345035,
345036,this seems most likely the case
345037,great timing
345038,poor guys
345039,yeah it sucks d
345040,as the world turns burns
345041,sheit sorry to hear that man stay strong buidlers unite
345042,that said fe security sucks best of luck to their devs use vercel over cloudflare
345043,its probably a vercel hijack though
345044,you mean the leak from a few weeks ago
345045,never seen vercel successfully hijacked thought their whole thing was no api keysif that isnt the case please enlighten me
345046,there was a leak didnt know tbh our guys are still investigating
345047,sure ill inform when i have more info myself im no dev just a support guy d
345048,sorry it was heroku
345049,all i know right now is that the malicious code was somehow injected via a js code
345050,that makes sensesounds like youre describing insecure js more than anything
345051,it may well be a dns hijack as well gotta make sure as i didnt deploy it but theres gonna be a postmortem for sure
345052,
345053,redeem 095 ust for 1 of luna and sell to usdc since luna is crashing
345054,ah yes oauth tokensplease use 2fa its annoying but this kind of shit is easy to block
345055,you cant theres a 50m max per day that was my point above if that was possible then ust would stay at 1 whole luna went to 0 then ust would go to 0
345056,sauce
345057,some dude like 30 messages up but also i recall researching it a while ago and matches my recollection
345058,but its easy to check if its off peg supply should be shrinking massively and it isnt
345059,i did it 10 minutes ago only delayed depositswithdrawals to cex is a problem
345060,wasnt it the reserve thingamabob that has a limit not the redeem thingy
345061,so why would the peg not hold then everyone would just be arbing it and peg would stay at 1 while luna nukes
345062,emergency update is ust overwe are now live on twitter spaces feel free to join us feel free to join listener and if you want we can add you as speaker as well
345063,everyone has problems terra network is congested now and cex nodes are lagging
345064,because for one everyone is not as monolithic as the models and theories would have you believe if everyone held we would all be rich
345065,whats the reserve thingsmabob i understand you dont know the name but what was it supposed to do
345066,afaik it was the thing that was supposed buy it back under the peg but limited to some figure per day to avoid draining it in some attack
345067,any idea frens
345068,probably sold as a last line of defense idk does anyone know the wallet
345069,peg is back
345070,not at all 5 off
345071,wait hows that different from what i was saying my point was that there is a top limit of how much ust can be redeemed for luna
345072,wut is even going on dextools reporting 98
345073,whats the oracle say
345074,i dunno what to trust anymore
345075,with the reserve not randoms that own luna
345076,does anyone know what time the daily limit resets for luna
345077,maybe such a limit exists why though but if it does shouldnt it be in the docs
345078,doesnt it mint new luna when you redeem ust thats the process that i thought had a limit it makes sense to have a limit to avoid an infinite issuance type situation like iron finance had but that also means its currently not really backed by much of anything not even luna
345079,having a limit def makes sense otherwise luna price would get crushed immediately by the arb crowd this at least gives lfg time to react before everything goes totally to shit
345080,binance suspended ust withdrawals
345081,besides the redeemers there should also be arbitrageurs buying on spot markets at 095 and selling higher it doesnt have to hit 1 for them to make moneymaybe algo stablecoins need an insurance product which insures the peg and the insurer is the one doing the constant arbitraging and optimizing the algoor algo stablecoins would work better if at least partially backed by commodities those wont go to zero and they are not fiat eitherjust thinking aloud
345082,who will they sell higher to
345083,buying and praying the price goes up doesnt count as arbitrage
345084,
345085,restoring the ust peg
345086,peg isnt back up and you also cant sell anymore
345087,arguably very important lol verge still exists despite being exploited what half a dozen times
345088,u cant sell anymore huh u just have no ust thats all
345089,i thought the curve was drained some time ago already c and now with binance suspension of wds its paralyzed
345090,hey do you mind to check lobsters working group chat
345091,no its not
345092,guys lets please not spread bs if u can open a page within 1 minute
345093,gud old bear dayz
345094,ah sorries saw it above in the chat and didnt check c
345095,i think the curve ui is lagging out thats why some people think its gone to 0 or whatever probably due to half of crypto refreshing it
345096,assumedly hes keeping his finger on the button to be ready for when it goes to zero for the generational arb
345097,
345098,where is the second pool
345099,oh well fug i guess i spent 1 minute and confirmed ur words haha baldr
345100,crypto folks should have charts bar in the model of sports bar
345101,same here visited and its not at zero
345102,
345103,well thats a 0 if i ever saw one
345104,
345105,i agree with publius ppl
345106,is this guy from bean
345107,just interesting to see the context here
345108,im assuming some of you saw the wsj article on them today
345109,siap
345110,damn they are losing the peg once again this should be a good watch till asia wakes up
345111,which is fairly misleading without the context that its that low because their gubernance contract got exploited
345112,not that their model isnt imo flawed but its rekt for a different reason
345113,link
345114,
345115,
345116,
345117,yes
345118,anybody here use breez wallet i received some coins on ln new wallet and when sending on ln it says no route coulf it have something to do w outbound liquidity i only have a channel w breez might that be it is it safe to close the channelwill i get my funds to thr breez btc wallet
345120,anyone knows how to do fx hedging with crypto currency especially euros usdc
345121,what pool on terra has 1b liquidity ustluna then you also need a pool to dump luna
345122,buy usdt with it simple as that
345123,short oil
345125,theres no liquiditydemand for a crypto ruble
345127,mirror is a terra protocol for synthetics liquidity has been bad on it for a long while now
345128,borrow x rubles buy y dollarswait for rubles to go down buy x rubles with y z dollars return rublez profit
345129,or just take a fixed rate loan denominated in rubles buy a house and sell it for 10x the price in rubles
345130,in a few months
345131,wait
345132,how is the ruble higher than what it was before the war
345133,nan
345134,low liquidity
345135,sanctions restrict selling rubles for foreign goods and services
345136,interesting
345137,probably real exchange rate is different
345138,thats some pretty slick move
345140,how so
345141,ye i getit
345142,i cant pay for spotify with rubles which roughly means that i cant sell them for usd
345143,bitcoin fixes this
345144,i believe that consumer goods domestically in russia are still inflating faster than rubles appreciating against usdeur but i havent done a deep dive
345146,bitcoin would also not allow sanctions on russia in the first place
345148,monetary at least
345149,you could refuse them goods and services
345152,how far will it actually go its already 9 under the peg and they have deployed the bitcoin panic is insane and asia isnt even up luna will go to 1 digit at this rate
345158,i think this view is valid in a petri dish but totally disregards the reliance on faith and confidence and the replicability of a new ponzi with no scars
345160,i dont think that ust will break maybe depeg in the short term but will repegi am not very optimistic on lunas price action it might suffer from this
345161,im not an expert but i havent touched it since i cashed out some synthetics i was holding on it last may to buy the floor of crypto they dont have a liquidity graph up anymore and the premiums on the assets page make it look like its dead in the waterwhen the protocol had reasonable liquidity last year the premiums were within a few percentage points typically
345162,can someone get how big are long short positions on ustusdt through cexs rn
345163,want to see the actual market sentiment instead of twitter threads
345164,nan
345165,bybt
345166,went down to 082
345167,wow
345168,f
345169,you have it with funding rates and open interests on perp platforms
345170,when do we get lobsterdao sticker szn again
345171,its bear market surely lets turn on the memes
345172,lfg reserves seems to be about 35b if this is up to date
345173,time to buy the dip
345174,so thats the max in buying pressure they can unleash on ust as far as i understand
345175,it is already 15 up since the bottom it looked like targeted selling once again
345176,whats less clear to me is how much ust they can pull out redeem for luna and sell it without completely tanking luna price
345177,this is like a mini version of soros breaking the peg whos gonna become a billionaire from this one big trade
345178,someone whos on the inside somewhere pls make an oral history
345179,lol even terrasation is down
345180,alemeda
345181,guess ill buy at 050 during tomorrow depeg
345182,thats no fun tho sbf already rich enough
345183,he will simply donate all profits to factory farmed chickens
345184,the marketing execs and c suite in his charities arent though
345185,do you guys think in 20 years ppl will have nutty conspiracy theories about sbf lol
345186,probably already exist
345187,i mean outside of crypto zeitgeist
345188,cant people still swap ust for luna at terrastation
345189,at 1
345190,i will say tho that im impressed how wormhole is holding up rn just moved a bunch of ust back to ethereum and it went through smoothly with no delays or hiccups
345191,did he pinky promised to donate all his money to charity
345192,yes he did
345193,probably
345194,we have a big opportunity to control the memes of production then
345195,100 they will make a movie out of this
345196,the stuff we say here could affect what ppl are thinking sbf is up to in 20 years
345197,i think so yes apparently on chain peg is still 1
345199,someone just told me they limit swaps at 20m per day or so
345202,
345203,read the rules wrong channel no shilling here
345205,
345206,it happens all the time in shit tier economies exchange rate set by governance is different from what you can get on real market
345207,defi is an economics speedrun
345209,anyone ever needed a loan borrow ust at 090 just hodl it and when it goes to 080 or lower use other funds to buy cheaper ust to repay the loan and release collateral but if hodled ust goes to 1 then sell it lol
345210,there is the borrowing interest rate to consider but from 090 to 080 could happen in a day or so
345211,its all about liquidity synthetics were never that popular even during bull szn during bear its going to be tough to find a favorable trade i think
345212,thats the same thing as buying ust if it goes to 08 and shorting ust if it goes to 1 what would you gain by borrowing it now
345213,is it still like this
345214,why is the usdt quote 5 cents higher than the dollar ptice
345215,
345216,25m luna minted 129m ust burned on may 9
345217,its not going to survive this time still too much of luna to liquidate15 billion and no way to get out of ust
345218,isnt the maximum 100m
345219,i know i just didnt get it is all
345220,smartstake data shows this 130m change
345225,
345226,one of the craziest days in crypto
345227,erm 6 billion usddid i count right
345228,when i got into crypto last year and researched luna after catching gain after it mooned in march i thought this is a doomed ponzi and sold then when it survived the may crash i thought oh that was a good stress test ill buy back inthank god i sold
345229,this is nuts
345230,69
345231,generational buy once ust gets obliterated
345232,do is gonna be fine he cashed out 2b back in jan
345233,no one is worried about do lol
345234,what should be ust bottom
345235,
345236,they capped it at 70c for a moment but ftx decided it is time to go even lower
345237,whats there floor now
345238,50c
345239,its going to get there very soon if keeps going like this
345240,it probably will there is nobody defending the peg anymore so exchanges are just doing what is in their best interest making money
345241,
345243,good for fees lol
345244,i jinxed it
345245,goerli no blocks for 14een hours can devs do something lol
345246,prophetic
345247,cryptochetty your fav video
345248,yea i honestly think what reserve will come out with at least wont be susceptible to the same thing that has luna in this death spiral atm
345249,of course not its backed by a bunch of fiatcoins
345250,and yet whats supposed to be interesting about yet another fiatcoin wrapper
345251,nothing imo its just like usdc
345252,nan
345253,coiner i know you havent even read the website i dont want to do battle with you just exchanging information
345254,eh lets not pretend you didnt runaway when i quoted the site and you didnt like the fact i wasnt interested in a fiatcoin wrapper
345255,the pms are still there
345256,which government is issuing debt bond as tokens
345257,just curious if thats what they meant
345258,i think that answers questions here until they do we have fiatcoins and gold backed tokens or algo ponzis
345259,none yet everything is still pretty early the support to do such is what is important
345260,isnt this exactly what tether is doing
345262,then its just going to be a stable coin with usdc and usdt in treasury right
345263,
345264,someone linked the alpaca finance automated vault here earlieri read through the docs linked above and im not getting how it worksin particular how do they get the leveragethe usual method i know is to put up your assets as collateral borrow stables swap for more assets rince and repeatbut the diagram in the docs dont really seem to fit with that method
345266,they have in house lending markets
345267,a fiatcoin with more steps but its okay because supposedly
345268,you know they have 500000 people using rsv in south america
345269,makes it okay
345270,seems like its more fiatcoin as a service
345271,not really anyone can make their own stablecoins rtokens out of any tokens they want it can be anything even ust if youre feeling suicidal
345272,
345273,ivan chill
345274,i really like the concept of being in control of your own stablecoin
345275,i mean they actually do do you prefer crypto adoption or ponzinomics
345276,if adoption means gifting some random startup pii then by all means give me all the ponzinomics ser
345277,random startup pii wut
345278,we already have fintech
345279,i fail to see the point of a knockoff thats just about worse in every way
345280,i mean it does use crypto in the back and its fintech in the front why do we glorify ponzinomics and then wonder when it blows up
345281,im with coiner i need ponzinomics
345282,we can start by coming to terms with the fact that the blowups are par for the course lol
345283,but i suppose that doesnt work for le massadoption train
345284,this
345285,to help with the mass adoption of torrenting we shall make pirated content illegal on the networki digress
345286,
345287,is it verified that ust has sold its bitcoins to attempt to restore peg
345288,anyone read any good thoughts on a stable coin living at a non 0 or 1 price long run intuitively it doesnt seem like ust can exist long at any other price its melting my brain trying to figure out why anyone would use a 074 stable coin not saying the peg wont restore just kind of curious
345289,hi lobsters has there ever been a case of amms allowingcreating a setup which allows borrowing partially from lp pools with lots of idle liquidity seems like theres a lot of idle liquidity in amm pools which can be more capital efficient
345290,they didnt sell directly
345291,of the official only this
345292,
345293,
345294,you cant borrow from lp funds without changing the pool depth assuming xykthe funds may be idle relative to avg trade size but theyre needed for the invariant to support tradesif you wanted to both borrow funds and keep the same pool depth youd probably have to move the unborrowed funds into a more concentrated liq position
345295,a separate but related method would be using the lp shares as collateral to borrow other tokensof which aave duality impermax etc and others are alrdy doing
345296,thats old
345297,lol only in crypto we can tell you that a 20h post is old news u guys are too fast
345298,
345299,to be fair much has changed with ust luna in that time frame
345300,balancer v2 asset managerboosted pools
345301,ust going up
345302,why is not ust in gearbox when world needs it
345303,wow what an organic conversation between two completely ordinary real humans here
345306,unit protocol allows you to use shibaswap lp as collateral
345307,i know right you gotta keep up with the space nobody ever sleeps here compared to stock market
345308,just put together this expert ta on ustusdt do enjoy
345309,delphi should accept membership paid in ust
345310,haha
345311,its not a joke they have been writing about ust very much
345312,ha ha true
345313,i think they already do
345314,nan
345315,no ser
345316,ust hasnt got that wide adoption
345317,being used as a payment method is a whole new level
345318,under the monthly option
345319,
345320,next one
345321,15 mil is actually tiny needle in this market
345322,ust experiment shows flaws copy paste of ust decides to do exactly the same and expects a different outcome well played justin
345323,cause they have jsun
345324,joke aside this is just pure makerting movelike el salvador bought the dip yesterday
345325,yep of course nothing original ever comes from that camp
345326,what should really be happening with copypasta projects is they should be taking a long hard look at the underlying mechanics which they probably dont understand to try and learn from what happens at scale during periods of high volatility
345327,i think justin is just so used to stealing everything by now that he doesnt even bother making own theories anymore
345328,meanwhile near thought bringing a 10 stablecoin with similarsame ponzinomics is a smart idea
345329,i thought justin left tron to bring defi to south america or something
345330,are there algostables that trade the directional risk exposure to the collateral to time decay instead ive seen one tiny protocol that was doing something in that general direction but cannot unfortunately locate it
345331,uxd
345332,but i think you can summarize all the luna issue with they simply didnt own enough btc to guarantee a peg next time they better buy 34x as much
345333,and how this is going to help in environment of falling btc
345334,i dont think a good ponzi theory works if you try to assume how it reacts if it fails
345335,probably how is this one expected to implode
345336,this will implode if mango cannot pay so big price movement with lack of liquidity on mango liq fund depletion
345337,liq fund uxds insurance fund
345338,no mango liquidation fund
345339,thats his excellency to you
345340,i thought uxd was all hedged derivatives instead of actual tokens no it honestly felt more like a very smart way to get more volume to mango ftx and other markets like that a directionality hedged stable sounds good but itll be a lot less efficient so doubt itll get any adoption in an environment where everyone exclusively chases yield
345341,probably perfect storm as equities and commodities all had a bad day yesterday too so all the hedges
345342,the real irony here seems to be that tether was right all along to hide their reserves if they exist if everyone just assumes you might have them then a dump like this doesnt impact you because no one can model whatll happen unlike with luna this feels like a very bad lesson
345343,thats the worst idea ever
345344,i am a human thank you very much the reason i asked is because they did the audit for usdd
345345,the real giga brain move would be if it turned out that do did this whole thing on purpose go massively short on ust then let the fud get out of hand as soon as it dumps do nothing and let it dump harder then when it seems all doomed unwind the short at a massive profit put it all into lfg and announce its now a 5x over collateralized stable hed just come out with well were smarter than you and if you were a real lunatic you held through it all fuck the people that sold pray to me your god
345346,yes but youve kinda add exchange counterparty risk to the mix and what is even more interesting mango is going to settle yours stable pnl in usdc so you are actually also exposed to that
345347,oh yeah i dont particularly like it either lots more risk for marginal extra capital efficiency
345348,
345349,abracadabra
345350,central bank restrictions on buying eurdollar for the retail sanctions against almost all so there is no need to buy cuz you can buy nothing from useurope no matter retail or business sp there is no real demand for at the moment only export works we are still selling gas and oil and even some of eu countries pay in rubbles this measure to pay for gas in rubbles was the response for sanctions so there is a demand for rubble real exchange rate you can see where there is a demand on on how we change fiat into crypto there its 7379 rub
345351,
345352,doesnt sifu got a half only by this morning
345353,
345355,thanks guess dashboards r wrong
345356,is there a ui for sushi pool management on polygon that is not theirs portfolio trackers tell me i have a long forgotten lp position there was made during the original sushi phase on polygon but i cannot get to it now via their ui and interacting with the contract to get to it is not straightforward the fact that slp tokens are not in my wallet does not help either probably stuck in some long defunct farm i cannot find
345357,nan
345358,i woke up too early this morning
345359,have you checked wether you can find it via debank
345360,yes is appears in all the portfolio tracking uis
345361,yeah regulators would love that move even the south korean one i bet
345362,im sure they wont love it imploding either but yeah youre definitely right
345363,i dont see how they are going to like lfg which is a related entity market making either for that matter as long as they are actively trading their own stuff that seems like a major reg risk
345364,when retail actually get hurt from manipulation that gets regulators balls tingling with justice
345365,but dont think its likely they would short ust themselves
345366,oh i mean i agree its both unlikely and probably a bad idea just saying it would be hilarious if they did because it would near certainly work and the outcome would be crazy
345371,it would be interesting seeing the overall pnl for the luna foundationlfg jump capital 3ac and alameda for just their luna and ust related activities
345372,someone probably shorted right
345373,or at least were hedging with shorts
345374,yeah feels like with anything coming from alameda youve always gotta read between the lines because they will technically say something true and then dump all over you despite having never actually lied
345375,
345376,he says they arent selling ust but he doesnt mention if they for example have a massive perp short position which technically wouldnt be selling their ust etc to hedge their risk entirely or would even net benefit from an implosion
345377,ofc same as were not selling any stg we bought on pre sale doesnt mean they arent farming the hell of it and market dumping all the rewards
345378,we get the answer in cmt
345379,got it done through the contract had to trace back through my txs but all good
345380,its kinda funny that everyone always assume that you can hedge everyone and your mother with shorts without ever considering if theres even enough liquidity for shorts on this scale
345381,anyone from airswap here
345382,the snag in that plan you can make 5x the value of ust by shorting ust nor even by shorting luna given its market cap before this all went down
345383,hey hey lets not mess up a fun thing with reality
345384,im trying to read lidos auditsanyone can tell me what their dc4bc distributed custody for beacon chain is used for in lidowho are the distributed parties when are their distributed keys used

345392,ivan said gear at 3k everyone screenshot
345393,just made a infographics about stablecoins trilemmawhat do u guys think
345394,nan
345395,willy has a 5050 hit history not convinced yet its indeed citadel
345396,i took a screenshot weve all seen it
345397,nan
345398,you should had rai in the center the money god
345399,guys have we finished yet
345402,dov stuff
345406,
345407,how do i achieve step 1
345408,uh
345409,a be citadel
345410,source trust me bro
345411,price stability
345412,sincerely coping member of lunatics
345413,yeahits kinda depegdeath spiral protection factor
345414,mah lusd always forgotten
345415,how is ust decentralized by any chance i dont get it
345416,we cant get a fully decentralized stable
345417,dai is more decentralized at this point being only 27 collateralized by usdc
345418,this is the only centralized part of it kinda
345419,ust fully backed by ta dam nothing
345420,you cant hit pause or something
345421,thats basically it i still see luna people coping about how usdcusdt goes off peg but theyre forgetting you can go to bitmex or circle and cash out 11 they cant be that deep into it can they
345422,no evidence
345423,they literally call themselves lunatics
345424,then previously reluctant holders rush to get out againcorrect me if im wrong 16b ust circulating thats now under water according to coingecko 60mm exit liquidity in the largest pool not accounting for slippage 120mm daily exit from burn mechanism at bestit seems like fire in a crowded theater kinda scenarioand wouldnt the vcs themselves be looking to get out asap right about now
345425,i think its much less circa after such events even on first day of redeeming it was around 12bln iirc
345426,nan
345427,less circa meaning the vcs and mms are the heaviest bag holders and they will never sell so retail can exit firstalso does ust in anchor mean that they cant be withdrawn to exit
345428,even assuming it doesnt go to 0 itll probably be a lot harder to convince people to go into anchor for 16 yield now that the risk perception will be dramatically different and seems like that was pretty much the entire attraction luna had
345429,you give this market too much credit
345430,remember the last umpteen times someone said things would be different because of big event and barely 2 weeks later it was business as usual
345431,indeed
345432,i think it will be like iron
345433,iron is still around but no where near what it was
345434,replace anchor with bitfinex at the time of haircut people have memories of goldfish in this space i would agree not the same situation but potentially salvageable
345435,speaking as luna bagholder who got wiped out i think a real more than shortterm comeback for terra would entail ditching or downplaying anchor strategy redesigningrecalibrating the stability mechanism and a facelift to the narrative
345436,i do think its possible but will be rough waters
345437,do you know the team vpepo
345438,there will always be a hard core of fanbois for terrabut yes it will chill the prospects for lunaterra a lotearly investors like novogratz and 3ac will have a hard time convincing their tradfi network to invest in terra unless there are big changes eg do kwon steps down
345439,degens have risk perception
345440,if youre the ceo of a coin you have to take the fall when things go badly
345441,yeah i agree crypto will be fine i agree some sort of a new algo stable will come along and people will ape in because they dont actually look backwards but anyone think luna will fully recover
345442,what if hethey not look at jsun
345443,i dont think it will ever fully recover ie get back to 18b market cap
345444,btw anyone has stats for justing ponzi tvl collateral etc
345445,not trying to kick you while youre down but what other strategy can viably drive demand for ust if not anchor yield thats been the linchpin of the ecosystem and the failure of attempts to diversify demand away from it have made it an anchor
345446,looks like no one bother count any tvl on his chain
345447,i am pretty sure even his excellency doesnt have that data
345448,haha yeah im just curious how many brainlets out there in this space
345449,because trx didnt do much even with higher apy offer
345450,lobster daily 406 daily recap 9 may1 one of the most powerful ddoses ever targets cryptocurrency platformlinklink to discussion 2 frenz are there real usecasesprojects using erc4626 alreadylink to discussion 3 yearn allowlist a recently introduced feature making the yearn website more securelink link to discussion 4 ust lunalink to discussion 5 by buying and holding bitcoins on exchanges you contribute to the fall of the price read link to discussion6 is there a rekt simulator which helps me see how much i am getting rekt for in total when i get liquidated on oasislink to discussion
345451,the original philosophy was to do a lot of deals with vendor networks and brands in meatspace and also build defi and other apps on terra to drive organic demand on both sides ust and lunaanchor drove hypergrowthcould go back to the old strategy and build slower more organically do has proved himself to be a consummate dealmaker together with a great inhouse legal team look at the nationals sponsorship they pulled offwith money from a daofrankly i wish they had focused on that instead of anchor and wonderland stuff as they are great at making deals those deals will lead to more sustainable growth but now after a scandal like this i imagine it will be much harder to get those deals done
345452,as someone who held and rebought through the may crash last year i agree the wonderland stuff is when i got spooked out of my position and it seemed like the growth from anc yield was getting dangerous
345453,hey is there a way to search for all contracts that refer to a given third contract addy lets say i want to scan etherscan for all protocols deploying various aave stuff
345454,the only thing that could rescue lunaterra at this point is a big change in strategyalso not spending time trashing other projects eg dai that just creates enemies who want you to fail the swagger doesnt win over patient investors
345455,keeping high apy in anchor is a dead way supply demand luna needs to fix this
345456,it has survived its biggest stresstest to date and in record time compared to makerdaos black thursday onwardscue the exploding heads
345457,did tetranode ever comment on the exploit of his fuse pool on arbitrum a few days after fuses huge 80m exploit on mainnet
345458,but i dont know what will happen when ust back to peg people sell again
345459,so can anyone eli5 the luna algo for stabilization for me
345460,i know they bought a lot of bitcoin as an attempt to collateralize the ust supply but there is no way they couldve covered the entire supply with collateral for one and second obviously the drop in btc value meant they lost a heavy chunk of whatever collateral did exist is that the main issue for the depeg the btc value drop or is it that an algo stable coin is essentially 100 failure throughout history even before cryptocurrencies
345461,you burn luna to get same amount of ust if luna is 30 u get 30ustat any time u can convert 1 ust to 1 of luna even if ust is below pegif ust is below 099 then u can swap 1 ust for 099 of btc or was it 1 of btc cant remember but thats the eli5
345462,then the market is supposed to bring ust back to peg from the arbitrage opportunityterraswap lets you get better than market price for luna denominated in usd value by swappingredeeming ust to mint lunaso you ust luna market dump luna profit
345463,btc was always a backup to the native seignorage mechanism there were plans to have a pool for that btc with ust to protect peg primary mechanism is ustluna but has various caps etc and as we saw arbitrage broke down between cexs and terra because the terra infrastructure started breaking also 4pool was days away from being in placeattack timed perfectly to preempt these new mechanisms
345464,why isnt the arbitrage working
345465,caps infra breaking
345466,sorry dont mean to sound stupid but i am actually what im being is lazy lol
345467,is that the attack part
345468,it is working it just isnt allpowerfulluna price dumping heinously is a feature of the algo when ust is offpegthe algo cannot keep up with this amount of market volatility targeting ustluna
345469,someone hit the infrastructure
345470,no just a very well timed series of open market operations that look like an attack by the party lfg originally bought btc fromthis is a speculation though
345471,oh ok
345472,buy billions in btc with ust now you have armed someone with ust they can dump
345473,again speculation
345474,
345475,its not profitable to arb due to spread
345476,ahh now some of the tweets twatted about kwon make sense im not familiar with that piece
345477,so basically the mechanism for creating arb incentive is also created to have a slow burn obviously to prevent arbs from pushing the price the other way in an over correction
345478,but now we have a spread so big that the delay has caused serious concern and thus even more dumping of the pegged token and increasing the spread further
345479,a laymens understanding maybe
345480,there are a lot of moving parts the basic foundation is the relationship between lunaust mint luna during ust contraction burn luna during ust expansion past that any basic explanation is going to miss some key points or turn into a wall of text
345481,ok its probably those moving parts and key points and i can do my own research on those and stop being lazy but perhaps one more piece of clarificationif luna 50 and i mint 50 ustthen luna drops to 30 due to market being crazy now for example a burn of ust would have a gap right because now i could burn 30 ust and still have 20 ust 1 luna but if everyone did that there wouldnt be enough luna
345482,oh nm thats stupid it just mints luna
345483,
345484,so the whole thing hinges on luna having value essentially is there any other usecase for luna i assume its similar to maker where its a dao token
345485,nan
345486,when outstanding debt real assets someone in the game needs to lose to rebalance the game
345487,what you guys think about ust right now
345488,thats what we were just discussing jamessean1
345489,i think you want to me let me do a quick recap
345490,there are rewards for staking luna and it has a 21 day lockup im by no means an expert though so if you want to do a deep dive dyor is probably bestthe setup depends on investor confidence ultimately though
345491,i propose a crypto accreditation test where youre banned from touching crypto if you fail and redirected to safer alternatives all to protect retail of course
345492,it accrues fees from underlying network activity like and its required for stakingkinda recursive but can be valued
345493,as they all do in the end
345494,you submit your personal information and any exchange that sees that bans you from buying again to protecif you circumvent said ban you forfeit the right to complain about any future rekt
345495,lol i think they should give the same test to politicians who then cannot discuss it within hearings if they fail
345496,then we could finally stop having to listen to old yellen janet
345497,i think cocacola should introduce the worlds best stable coin pegged to a bottle of any cocacola product 1 coca 1ml of product from any store be it a supermarket or a convenient store 355ml can 355 coca and out you gofritolay could do the same for 1oz chips
345498,imo besides as pos staking only use case of luna is to mint ust
345500,thtas really basically it as long as there is any value running the terra chain luna will have value and ust can be pegged
345501,and deploy anchor to more chains
345502,i dont think the business of underused loans combined with interest out of thin air is really scalable across chains
345503,anyone happen to know if theres a dex on terra main net so not bridged that is integrated with fireblocks or any way to easily bridge from terra to eth through a fireblocks wallet
345504,remember the debate about whether l1 blockchains or dapps more like brandschain agnostic were better investments in terms of long term value capture right now i guess the answer is l1s
345505,
345506,how would lido coordinate any of the attacks he suggests outside of regular node operator collusion
345507,lidos stake is with numerous node operators many of which dont have relationships w each other outside of participating in lido lol
345508,he also named governance attacks and contract exploits
345509,i think he is mostly referring to systemic risk having something too big that fails
345510,indeed but thats a good argument
345511,lido reorging is not a good argument imo
345512,lido is the protocol with biggest eth deposits afaik what would happend if it gets hacked another fork
345513,because were assuming theyd be unwilling to collude
345514,fresh outta the oven
345515,well it would be like 10 node operators colluding right nto super different from 10 nonlido node operators colluding
345516,with each other they dont need lido to do that

345525,the most entertaining outcome is the most likely
345526,curve has se most degenerate twitter
345527,im surprised the tweet didnt seem to move the market at all
345528,is it possible this could be explained a bit morewhy was there a huge slippage when arbers try to burn ust to mint lunawhy was the redemption of luna not profitable for arbers
345529,further what is different now why is it recovering now and not yesterdayimmediately
345530,if u re mm who is redeeming luna to be market neutral u have to quickly 1 short it or sell on the market 2so everything works fine during flat marketsits enough liquidity for u to do that u can accept delays of cex confirmations and other systemic delaysbut during fast crash your bots are loosing everythinghuge spread empty orderbooks bigger delays huge volatilityso as a mm u are limiting funds on your bots to reduce such risks no arbitrage untill situation goes back to normal
345531,i think the main issue was the exchanges were taking several hours to process ust withdrawals and ust price discovery was happening at the cexs
345532,yes totally agreebut why is there slippage in the redeem process of ust to luna in the dapp
345534,this article was written 2 weeks ago no why is this relevant now
345535,its programmed in terra market modulethis mechanism ensures liquidity and acts as a lowpass filter allowing for the spread fee which is a function of terrapooldelta to drop back down when there is a change in demand causing a necessary change in supply which needs to be absorbed

345557,hey whats the best oracle options to get ftmusdc pairs on smart contracts from spookyswap
345558,tweet deleted
345559,looks like this too now
345561,what you want an oracle option or the quote from spooky
345562,i thought a need an oracle to get the uptodate prices from spooky for my smart contracts but seems like it can be received directly from uniswapv2pair
345563,yes but be careful its really easy to manipulate
345564,asking uniswap v2 pairs for prices as if they were secure oracles its a risky practice so only use that if you are sure u are not vulnerable to price manipulation
345565,example flash loan move price on uni v2 pair hack you repay flash loan profit
345567,wow mods are hella fast these days props to you guys couldnt even report him
345575,what can you recommend to use to avoid it
345592,sell one million things for one dollar
345594,wanna have fun discussions buy our fucking ugly nft and join the private chat so louis can feed his family
345595,do you need the uniswap v2 pair quote for something in particular
345596,there is lobby nft holder chat
345597,multiple sources of data from multiple markets across multiple amms and cexs is the only way really
345598,but even then it can be manipulated if the incentive is there
345599,you might just use chainlinks oracles
345600,or univ3 twaps
345601,but univ3 is not on fantom
345602,does chainlink cover more obscure assets though
345603,also there was an oracle developed by andre for saving univ2 pair data and using twap calculations
345604,yes ser pinned message link
345605,nah it doesnt that is why we use univ3 as fallback for obscure assets
345606,thank you sers

345611,pokt flashbots
345612,also ok

345620,ah then no rug link pinned

345633,does anyone here have good experience with decentralized databases or user data ownership structure if you could point me to some good resource thatd be cool too
345634,is it because the utility wasnt available the moment they sold the token idk
345635,the sentence is pretty clear just because it has utility doesnt mean the utilizer isnt expecting profit therefore insert leap its a security
345636,
345637,why isnt delphi getting way more shit
345638,0 was always the end game

345643,fyi
345652,i asked whether 50ms speed improvement could in any way help a user mint faster blocked within minutes lol
345653,nan
345654,coinbase posts net loss of 430 million for q1 2022
345655,need to list more tokens
345657,has anyone been following the projects like cubes and flava that offer faster private nodes as if the 50ms speed improvement will help get the block mined faster
345658,i wonder how you incurr a net loss of almost half a billion in one quarter as a crypto token exchange
345659,laughs in sbf
345660,found this table of coinbases operating expenses from their shareholder letter
345661,that spike in administrative and other operating expenses they attribute it to larger headcount and some losses to due certain incidents
345662,doesnt mention what was the incident
345663,theyre overpaying that top nft guy of theirs lol
345664,their ebitda fell from 12m to 19k thats really stark
345665,tech and development 570m wtf are they doing
345666,building a paintjpg trading platform is expensive stuff ser
345667,handing out 1memployee
345668,coinbasechain
345669,lol know a software engineer they hired out of undergrad dude barely know anything about crypto i understand you dont need all your employees to know crypto but something is just off about that
345670,new disclosure in coinbase 10q after earnings in the event of a bankruptcy customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors coin
345671,this is a fun one
345675,
345676,went down
345677,coinbase stock falls 15 after hours after quarterly revenue misses estimatesarticle comments
345678,doubt its because of that part specifically though
345679,how does the wormhole bridge work can you track a tx from eth side to terra side wallets
345680,does this can only happen to algorithmic stablecoin like terradai or could it happen to stablecoin like usdc in the future
345681,dai is not an algostable
345682,for reference
345683,the doc has fei as algorithmic but maybe its better termed as synthetic you can always redeem for the eth pcv
345684,noted for dai thx
345685,the doc has ousd as synthetic but should be backed as each ousd is minted from 100 from either usdc usdt dai
345686,i think in general the semantics of backed should imply noncrypto assets otherwise it just conceals systemic coupling
345687,tether aiming to get sufficiency on statemine chain meeting some resistance more resistance coming soon
345688,holy smoke 5k fte vs what several hundred tops at ftx
345689,how did binance not flag a 750m ust deposit or wasnt this the case
345690,ftx had like 30 fte 18 months ago then acquahired grew to 100ish in last 12 months never understood how they managed to build this empire with so few people
345693,yikes
345694,tbh it sounds too low i must be wrong somewheretheir ebitda last year was 3b
345695,god damn the lunatics are soon going to need be strapped in straight jackets in the asylum soon down only
345696,imaging calling stablekwon and being the reason the crypto market is bleeding
345697,
345698,source 4chan
345700,luna on its way to replace ust as the new stablecoin
345701,ust close to 0 and luna close to 1
345702,nourharidy time to merge dola stability with lfg collaterals
345703,hope reverse of it
345705,soon lunaust will break the internet with division by zero
345706,god damn you cant look away from that chart
345707,left it at 7 came back to 4
345708,nan
345709,the only out is do announcing ust v2 with a different mechanism and 11 redemption with v1
345710,anypne has a link to that tweet from nov
345711,
345712,ust v2
345713,citadel analyst must have read that lol
345714,apparently hes made a few other ones before at least their devs have
345715,we just need fed to issue more usds and back ust its not a coincidence that ustreasury sounds similar with ust
345716,could a single do tweet about ust v2 could send ust to 70c again
345717,or is it really truly dead
345718,is there consensus on this being the actual attack that caused this
345719,anyone has a link to an archived version of it
345720,the original thread seems to be deleted
345721,that thread really reads a bit weird
345722,the mechanism described there is different
345723,ser how can this weird
345724,the real bull
345725,up only
345726,the future
345727,bullish
345728,btc over 100k
345729,finally 100k btc
345730,hold hold hold
345731,dai just flipped ustdais not dead yet guys
345732,looks like scam not simple attack story
345733,are people keeping ust up by shorting it right now and buying it to do so
345734,what
345735,people either have to borrow to sell or buy to close a short shorting definitely doesnt have a net positive effect on price but shorts closing can
345736,bro pls reread
345737,u short by borrowing more and selling wdym
345739,u ok bro
345740,been a long year for everyone these past 48 hours
345741,hahahh
345742,chainsecuritybros are tripping up todays a special day
345743,imagine having all your luna staked and still having to wait another 3 weeks before you can sell it
345744,where
345745,binance maybe
345746,onchain staking on terra has a 21day unstaking period
345747,ah anchor unstake works instantly
345748,anchor unstake doesnt really work instantly bluna is just a staking derivative its just that you can sell the bluna for luna on a blunaluna lp or similar
345749,to unbond bluna you still have to wait 21 days
345750,staked luna in the hope of airdrops but got pricedrop
345751,you delegate it to a validator on terra station terra is a pos blockchain
345752,so youll have to wait for recovery diamond hands by design im also in ust boat
345753,how is celsius doing these days
345754,
345755,chads who has ideas
345756,just 618k left really
345757,78m left
345758,demand is only up if borrowed lusd was sold offnot exactly sure what you are asking
345759,check wormhole ust factory 53
345760,anyone known where can wrap wormhole luna
345761,it was always reverse less lusd where is it coming from now
345762,grifters starting to cover their ass from the incoming regulation lol
345763,zhusu deleted after 7 days id 1521584589277433857
345764,maybe eth holders looking to leverage the dip buy
345765,and he sold
345766,yikes
345767,people shorting btcust because they expected crypto to fall must be seething rn
345768,this is new for me
345769,so you saying shorting btc with an asset that less than a dollar every minute
345770,i am not recommending this at all
345771,how is adoption of the graph going is it still the undisputed market leader for querying onchain data
345772,wait so you missing letter d right
345773,does anyone else think that this lunaust thing will have massive consequences beyond their bubble and the temporary market contagion if regulators and critics ever needed an excuse this is it i mean its not even an excuse if shit like this is allowed to grow to billions i can not even in good faith argue against them even as someone who is rather hostile to regulation we evidently failed to self regulate here despite a relatively huge number of people calling this out from the get go
345774,most probably yes especially for stablecoins
345775,yeah it being marketed as a stablecoin eg usd makes it 10 times worse thats their favorite angle already
345778,we failed to self regulate herehow or rather what would this self regulation look like
345779,more like we actually did self regulate some people were rekt because of such self regulation though
345780,good point it seems impossible i guess in an ideal scenario we would have collectively not let it grow to this point but we all know thats never going to happen because incentives reasonable behavior
345781,is there any chance ust will be saved everyone i am still staking a big portion and hold my breath
345783,i mean
345784,if it does a lot of trust will be lost ofc
345785,basicallycrypto trust in human greed
345786,all selfregulation is dead against it may be a scam but if i play my cards right i can profit
345787,do you want to be right or make money
345788,or the most recent iterationdont talk about good vs bad projects because thats dangerous
345789,self regulation looks like certification tags on the boxes of the products you buy self regulation would look like the best and legit stablecoin players making a review board and assigning a certifified non risky stably coin to legit players so consumers can know what they are holding problem is there would only be usdc in there right now and you have to bet on goodwill of current best players to let new players in
345790,you can of course force compliance in order to as the claim goes protect what is largely people like innocent retail from the market they enable scammers
345791,i dont know about you but a fiatcoin that can delete your money on a whim is the furthest thing from legit in my book
345792,actually government regulation also doenst save from such incidents enron lehman there r a lot of examples
345793,and i certainly wouldnt want them to have kingmaker powers over what constitutes legitimate
345794,thats true but they think they do so they are still absolutely going to try to invade our space and stuff like the ust ponzi will help them in
345795,when you can withdraw you can only withdraw thin air
345796,it could be pegged to 01 and fully collateralised
345797,
345798,made something quick
345799,i have the full vid if anyone wants
345801,didnt realise it was ever the undisputed market leader it is niche and reliant on specific subgraphs its slow and clunky
345802,first thing you sign off on you will lose 100 of the money you put in here do you confirm this money is in its entirety disposable
345803,what else is there except parsiq
345804,depends what sort of data you are after
345805,bitquery google bigdata nansen dune etherscan api etc etc
345806,hmm i meant like how the graph infrastructure is designed ofcourse it is way smaller compared to all the centralized options
345807,problem is the underlying indexer is poorly architected or was at least which is why when bsc did their usual copypasta of everything on eth the second tx volumes grew it imploded under its own weight and inefficiency and fell hundreds of thousands of blocks behind
345809,maybe we should show her we already have a degenscore in place to gatekeep access to innovative and risky defi products sure whell love that
345810,hmm makes sense wonder if covalent is better with their indexer
345811,
345812,nan
345814,well encouragingidk how they will do it thosad in any case sad for everyone
345815,fiatcoin does fiatcoin things they also want to be a bank dont know what either of those have to do with what i said though
345817,
345818,
345819,
345820,this basically says
345821,no remedy is coming
345822,so lawmaster10s tweet was likely true about the deal not happening
345823,
345824,so what is this one
345825,live to see another day maybe we recover in some time vibes
345826,which is fair but thats kinda grim
345827,he is doing the strat on we absorb at lowest prices and try to recover when the dust settles ok understood
345828,imho
345830,in short ust is not returning to peg because its burning too slow there a limit on how much can be burned they want to be able to increase the amount of mintingburning to allow for a faster mechanism
345831,i would love to hear more on this deciding whether to exit at a big loss or hodl
345832,
345833,and it will burn converting to luna
345834,nan
345835,more like ust is going to eat luna
345836,there wont be any luna to burn
345837,all to please stablecoin gods
345838,if its pacman luna is the ghost but it cant fight back
345839,
345840,what does faster mechanism do here apart from crashing it to 0 in one day
345841,i think its incorrect info at the moment tho
345842,lemme check
345843,their dashboard is not working properlt
345844,yeah basically hes saying people want to sell ust and the problem is that the arbitrage mechanism is too slow making people want to sell even more we can increase the speed of the mechanism reducing fear caused by the depeg but basically if people want to sell luna holders will have to take the pain
345845,really nothing its too late for it it doesnt magically create more demand for ust or make the system better but i am dumb so please correct if it does
345846,is there even going to be anyone on the buyside of the books
345847,if it worked luna would have just dropped and ust would have kept its peg better with ust dropping to as low as sub 25cents a death spiral has been started
345848,i believe that is what they want i dont believe they spent all of their treasury yet so basically they are saying lets have a flash crash and maybe we will buy the bottom
345849,but now its probably too little too late
345850,this isnt accurate analytics is lagged
345851,they can try to sqeeze out a little bit more liquidity of their die hard followers so big players can exit but fundamentally its game over for ust the reputation is burned and thats what stablecoins feed off even if you still personally believe in the thing the regulatory risk is too high for any sane person to use it its gg
345853,
345855,whilst doing branding has anyone here extended their logo check beyone just
345856,
345857,aaaaaand done
345858,so they will make dai v2
345859,1 we let it dump hard2 we try to buy at lowest possible3 we hope reserves will be enough4 yes luna ust holders r rekt more5 if we manage to buy out majority and stop bleeding we return peg and turn it collateralized6 likely at the expense of luna at 10 cents sold to vcs or other stuff like that
345860,first well increase the speed of the luna drop second i got nothing anyone else
345861,
345866,hi sers in a lunaust driven frenzied state of mind still completely my mistake though i sent usdc to my usdt address on kucoin ethereum address since its a compatible blockchain do you think i can recover my funds back sorry if this is inappropriate for this group just looking for some info
345867,anyone got their minting address to watch the flows
345868,wym minting address
345869,those swaps are native to the chain
345870,you can check if your usdc eth address is the same if it is it should have showed up otherwise youre going to need to contact kucoin for recovery
345871,their foundation address to check how much theyre actually minting
345872,its not thats why the trouble
345873,only chance is ask their support
345874,try emailing crying thats all u can do
345875,why they dont radically increase rates to motivate holdingstaking ust
345876,lol
345877,lol
345878,ponzi needs less ponzi not more
345879,this is what got them into trouble in the first place lmfao
345880,contact their support im sure its somewhere on there
345881,pretty sure you pay a fee to get it back assuming they agree to give it back to you
345882,they have made the right decision now but oof luna holders are mega rekt forever now
345883,yes
345884,luna is never going to recovr but ust might
345885,ofc but thats legit policy for gov banks in case of currency devaluation
345886,this is not a currency devaluation in any classic sense of the word
345887,over 200m luna minted in the last two days
345888,hard to say usdt hit 50cents at point and now its the largest stable coin i agree it doesnt look good but not impossible to get to a point where crypto people forget this honestly with peoples attention spans could be by next year
345889,yes wheres the address tho i want to see the new mints
345890,it sounds like youre dragging up some pretty historic experience can you give some examples of the services that had issues so we can verify the problem still exists my hunch is it does not
345891,you can not compare this to usdt it just depegged due to liquidity issues among some uncertainty but its in principle fully collateralized do not reply to this with muh usdt conspiracies thx
345892,err im pretty sure theres more than one address minting
345893,yes for sure do we have a dump of the addresses
345894,hell of a couple days
345895,if you want to see all mints your best bet is to just look at all the mint transactions
345896,the swap module is literally a cosmos module
345897,its built right into terracore
345898,there is no magic way to make less ponzi the project that was obviously prone do the downward death spiral from the first days
345899,then stop putting more resources into it it failed let it die dont start bailing out stuff that does not deserve it isnt that what people always criticize about the existing system
345900,there is though you let everyone who wants to leave ust leave luna will be close to 0 but it ensures the project survives then you reduce the retarded apy on anchor and put a cap which can be gradually increased on ust supply
345901,guys anyone redeemed ust to luna is there any manual how to do that
345902,imo it was fair high risk 20 fixed apy you want less risk then use overcollateralized or at least fraxlike stables
345903,i think you need to take a broader perspective on those things than their riskreward as a ponzi farm
345905,fully collateralized is the only way forward
345906,that reminds me
345907,so you are of the opinion that this whole lunaust thing was a net positive for the space and it should be done like that at any time againi am not asking for regulation but simply that bad ideas get called out as such especially after it becomes undeniably evident they were bad ideas
345908,isnt the problem with that logic that there is a markert that watches and sees this and just front runs them and shorts luna so by the time they have voted luna is already at 0
345909,what they really need is
345910,my opinion is that luna was way too risky for its tvl but regulation is not a solution
345911,did i say anywhere that regulation is the solution its not the solution but stuff like this will absolutely bring us closer to getting regulated
345914,then what means to stop putting more resources who should stop
345915,that was a response to your idea of saving ust by increasing apy ignoring the fact that it would not even work
345916,that can be accomplished in their native wallet terra station see the market swap section here
345917,from two wys 1 ban luna is some way or another2 let people and stablecoin builders learn by trial and error i would choose the second
345918,i dont think of it as net positive more like a byproduct of the defi freedom that net positive
345919,agree w mt those who call for hard regulations are usually just dumb because regulations always mean that some dumb retarded boomers will restrict everything you like and fuck you
345920,also there is already a market for safety whats the point in turning crypto into its knockoff numba go up
345921,except no one talked about regulation regulation is bad but that doesnt mean you save ust by raising the apy at this point
345922,
345923,bad ideas were called out even publicly on twitter but nobody listens until they lose money
345924,
345925,another casual 2 billy to defend the next ponzu
345926,speedrunning this bear market innit
345929,
345930,thats my biggest concern if this gets tether seriously looked at and people get nervous on that itll be exponentially more damaging since usdt is so completely integrated into everything
345931,i think it has an ok collateral though
345932,
345933,so you think the nyag case against tether wasnt a serious investigation
345934,lets pray it does
345935,from my understanding the ny ag investigation never lead to a full and thorough disclosure of the assets on hand did it
345936,no beef w frax sam is always clear w comms and id say more careful as well
345937,whats the reserve set to on frax these days
345938,nan
345939,luna sell all btc or just borrow usd
345940,furthest thing from a net positive considering every other algo stablecoin will be damaged for it not to mention just like literal scams its money that couldve gone to legitimate projects so the oftrepeated dont invest if you dont like it is pretty naivecalling out is good but have you ever tried calling out something when the numba is going up walls make better conversation
345941,thanks
345943,lol
345944,thank yourayne signaturerayne steinberg
345945,are these lps locked or managed by normal users that can withdraw at anytime
345946,nan
345947,theres still an observable 12 block latency from realtime which i was told at the time is because entity operations are sequential and take around 30ms each so my point still stands the indexer is not fit for purpose if you need realtime data its fine for casual queries and those that do not use graph data to trigger strategies onchain for example where the most timely information is needed
345948,not sure what you mean by a full and thorough disclosure of assets but the investigation looked at their books and revealed at the time that each tether was backed by around 70cents plus debt not sure if theyve gotten worse or closed the gap but with all the rumors about tether being insolvent youd think they would have found something more damaging
345949,30 millisecond latency okay thats a lot different than your first statement
345950,to process each entity in the block of which there are hundreds if not thousands sometimes
345951,which when theres 200 transactions and multiple on chain operations required to unpack the tx explains the 12 block delay
345952,so the total delay is around 30 seconds sometimes 1 minute
345953,yeah i have no specific insights beyond the rumors so dont get me wrong my point is purely if the gov starts investigating finds it no good and then does something we are in pretty deep trouble my understanding was theres really no transparency at all how much and what kind of assets are currently being held so after ust nuking that seems like a big black swan
345956,who owns the liquidity though does it have hundreds of millions in liquidity or is it basically renting it hoping it stays around
345957,gm fam whats lfg latest plan print luna to buy ust luna usdt ust
345958,so many things are happening im missing the point
345959,to let it go to zero and pray
345960,what happens if luna goes below ust price the death spiral dynamics pretty much remains the same right or is there any incentive to burn luna for ust
345962,its 70 owned by the protocol even if all 30 withdrew and sold into the curve pool peg cannot break the wonders of collateralization
345963,
345965,are you sure the problem isnt bsc rpcs at least on the hosted servicestreamingfast has a grant from the graph to develop a solution called firehose that parallelises data input itll roll out in production and on the network later this year overview from solana breakpoint conference
345966,
345967,will there be enough liquidity and market confidence for that
345968,most likely not ust is still massively off peg and luna is approaching 0 there is no way the remaining liquidity in luna will be enough to fix that there is also no incentive for people to buy luna it would be like a donation to ust holders
345969,yeah thats what i was thinking if the mechaism worked the peg should have been restored by now when luna fell 90
345970,the problem is theres more than one way to get out
345971,not everyone with ust is tripping over themselves to repeg it
345972,the mechanism works but in every version of works luna gets rekt
345973,then it doesnt work
345974,depends on what you prioritize the peg or luna lol
345975,ah i get what you are saying yeah luna is rekt but ust wont go back to peg either i think
345976,logically if your definition of works includes the price of luna going up as ust demand increases then the opposite should also hold
345977,luna die will ust die
345978,its not in principle entirely dissimilar to maker printing to cover the missing dai from black thursday
345979,but it was always clear that luna would potentially go to 0 if the peg does not restore quickly enough
345980,difference here is its automated vs being able to vote nope
345981,this is the graph hosted service for ethereum
345982,yeah i doubt it happens unless the oft mentioned billionaire friends show up and even then lots of rekt
345983,will if luna dies there is no reason for ust to live even if peg is restored
345984,yes
345985,no one is going to pay for anchor yields
345986,i have a feeling we have not seen the most creative solutions deployed yet
345987,its algorithmically impossible for luna to recover unless they get a large cash bailout to restore ust peg
345988,forks airdrops etc
345989,fdv of luna is less than 2b there is 7b ust at 045 it cannot come back
345990,its the perfect time for lfg to buy some more ust to add onto those yield reserves
345991,forks airdrops none of them actually solves their liquidity problem
345992,they need cash
345993,no there is never a right time for a stablecoin backed by thin aireven if the thin air token is partially printedused to buy btc as collateralalso muh apy of over 5 is not sustainablein the long run anyway
345994,atleast luna is soon 1
345996,luna to 1 before ust
345997,who did this themselves
346005,on size you can not make 20 a year reliably anywhere
346007,discussions are becoming a bit plebbish atm please limit shitposting for that u need to get nft and go to alfalol chat
346008,alpha lobs chatyou need at least 1 lobs nft to get into
346010,lol okay ill stop
346011,sorry sorry i dont mind the memes just too much shitposting at this point
346012,and all mechanisms etc were already debated explained above
346014,the psyops playluna will turn into the stablecoin at 1 and was planned all along
346023,is mainnet shadowfork 4 already ongoing cannot find anything about it but devops dashboard shows activity
346025,that weird feeling when u feel horrible and down bad but still gotta laugh about the memes lol
346027,if anyone feeling suicidal please check yourself into a mental hospital for your own safety this is your life you only got one
346028,nan
346030,whats going on with tether any clues
346031,probably nothing just market explosions
346032,tether still has an orderbook on a given market so this is likely a large market order
346033,0997 usd to usdt nothing s going on
346034,that does not explains the constant 3pool imbalance
346035,thats not down to tether
346036,they dont maintain 3pool
346037,a pool imbalance is likely a short term fluctuation as larger orders are filled equally the reported prices are probably using third party apis which will be smoothing underlying assets prices in their calculations
346038,aka its probably a nothingburger caused by volatility
346039,dont forget 3pool 1bsp going live in like 2 days thats going to help arbitrageurs
346040,
346041,the imbalance graph is taking live onchain data and has been going on for 3 days
346042,stop spreading panic on purpose
346043,is not fud genuily im asking if anyone know why 3pool got this imbalanced it has never been like this before
346044,bc people are selling usdt
346045,never been like this before yeah surenever happened before
346046,you must be new
346047,gm
346048,legit link pls dont rug my little shrimp
346049,take this with a grain of salt sources are unclear but would explain the instant downfall we have had and i would totally expect such reckless behaviour from celsius
346050,nan
346051,im worried about cex exposure to usdt were seeing a 2 depegging so far its starting
346052,stop fud
346053,usdt isnt 2 off peg anywhere
346054,paid shills
346055,it is on kucoin
346056,oh wow kucoin
346057,
346058,
346059,
346060,stop usdt fud sirs its the narrative in every bear market
346061,gets old
346062,
346064,
346065,def not a gm lol
346066,always a reliable source kucoin
346073,too much blabla
346074,um so what happens to terra the blockchain is that the blockchain if luna is rekt too badly
346075,my question exactly
346076,cheap fees thats for sure
346077,
346079,nan
346080,can admin stop spamming this we can look this up ourselves
346081,even lower than last nft mint
346083,nan
346084,3pool may be unbalanced but it also is not the largest source of tether liquidity so not entirely worth being worried about
346085,yeah this combined supply of usdt usdc and dai is about 150bn 3pool is not relevant in size nor is it in its utility ust and the likes need curve to keep their peg but 3pool assets dont
346086,funny enough uni3 pool is rekt already
346087,even the usdt on tron alone dwarfs it lmao
346088,does usdt peg manually or how does it work its not an algorithm right
346089,wen usdc depeg
346090,usdc gud stable
346091,backed with cash
346092,and cash equivalents
346093,arbitrage with a bank account from tether corp
346094,its a fiatcoin the peg is you trade it for fiat
346095,citadel bad guys depegging usdc
346096,who makes sure it gets pegged on exchanges like binance
346097,ok thanks
346098,big market makers like alameda
346099,ye lamo with us10y at 3 theyll make a sweet carry keke
346100,its backed because you can redeem it in theory
346101,so arbitrageurs make sure its pegged ig
346102,what do the arbitragers gain from trading their usd to usdt
346103,you buy usdt 1 and redeem it for 1 risk free profit
346104,not sure u can fully trust articles like thisbut u will have a view on how things are structured in cryptocexes
346105,but what if usdt doesnt go back to 1 value
346106,you literally go to tether inc and ask for your 1 in exchange for your 1 usdt
346107,where can i do that
346108,binance wont give me 11
346109,tether only does otc trades in size iirc
346110,yep
346111,
346112,admin do you have that picture thats going around by chance
346113,cant find it in chat
346114,
346115,what are you talking about please refrain from vagueposting
346116,
346117,outside of some entity bailing out terraluna is there any way they recover
346118,if so how would that lookhappen and what are the odds this bear market cant help at all
346120,anyone planning to visit this month
346121,we can no longer afford flights
346124,please keep events within bike travel distance
346125,what is next for luna is it going to recover at all or close the doors and out of business
346126,is this pure imaginary bs or something to it
346127,collapse the ust supply and restore the peg imo
346128,yes i can attend only if its in dubai mall will have to ask ivangbi to cover from intern budget if its in jumeirah
346129,and do it again now offer 30 yield
346130,why not
346131,charles is an idiot none of this is factual
346132,yeah lets call it lana so no one will suspect a thing
346133,i will be there
346134,agree on the first point so that was my assumption
346135,idiotic imaginary theories probably
346136,as real as smart contracts on cardano
346137,875 and rising
346138,awesome see you there
346139,0998 is a beating now
346140,people really clout farming by pointing out negligible stablecoin swings amid an unprecedented event lol
346141,exactly
346142,that account is smol tho so no disrespect but just sayin its a nothingburger
346143,i think he is talking about of frax and of crv in the pool not the price yet its still a small difference
346144,oh okay yeah but seeing people talk about tether the same way
346145,
346146,nan
346148,until you read it backwards
346149,ruh roh lol
346150,tssss you need to wait until it depegs
346151,we are watching it we own a huge chunk of pol on that trying to maximize convex amo earnings by keeping as much lp in there that we can without risking the peg already did a 100m frax retraction earlier this morning and will prob do another one later today
346152,
346156,ok just a month ago he s the hero luna is known not only by the ust demands increase but also the whole ecosystem and built on cosmo it does have value like another layer 1 so now if ust repegs again even if luna is 01 it still has value just as any other layer 1 am i right it shouldnt be dead right
346157,so eventually it will pick up the price if ust eventually repegs
346160,i am trying to understand why a month ago people praise on luna so much and now even if ust could repeg pp still believe it could be dead can anyone explain to me it has an internal value the whole thing is not just out of speculation only there should be few people including devs and hardcore lunatics right just like when it was launched in early days can anyone pls let me know what are the things i couldnt oversee here
346161,for what its worth the chain is actually pretty good the block explorer is diabolically bad but theres really great documentation its fast its relatively cheap its super centralised w 131 validators that are selected but there are competing chains with fewer its rust which makes things slightly complicated but theyve been doing a lot of work to integrate python into it
346162,better than a lot of other eth clones out there the tech is ok the strategies deployed leave more to be desired
346163,best feature is no flashloans
346164,isnt it tendermint based chain
346165,yeah its ibc tendermint
346166,there was enough justified fud 13 months ago i mean someone literally bet 10 mio against luna price
346167,but good lord above the block explorer is the worst i have ever seen
346169,yea so i mean terra plan to mint luna to save ust first and then lunas price will pick up price eventually due to its internal value as a layer 1 with relative ok ecosystem
346170,so technically an innovation was only terraust here as a part of protocolanyone is able to run their own tendermint chain for 12 days any middlesenior level dev ops guy no huge requirements for validators and validators are pbft consensus participants
346171,nan
346172,i prefer anul
346173,huh makes sense this was my first delve into tendermint based chain ill look for similarities between that and osmosis
346174,afaik they both built on top of cosmos sdk
346175,they are yes
346176,yes anyone can do that but not many could build so many fans with ecosystem around it like terra it s like a good product need good marketing but relatively average product with good marketing could work too
346177,how is the lunatics army now will they be strong enough to hold luna to 001
346178,shitcoin like doge or shiba still can hold proving how a strong community could hold a token without much utility at all
346179,so my argument is if shiba has no internal value at all and still hasnt been dead why now the market panic with luna
346180,because of bad stablecoin design with hardcoded death spiral attack
346181,that is in the case ust couldnt repeg yes
346182,will their plan minting more luna be able to save ust
346183,they need billions of usdtusdc asap to save itanything related to mintsburns lunaust just doesnt work anymoremoney gone already
346184,
346185,i am trying to understand why a month ago people praise on luna so much and now even if ust could repeg pp still believe it could be dead can anyone explainvery simplenumba go up revolutionary great tech great team x by eoy numba go down scam rug wen regulations im sending hitmen to your location
346186,this is true for both literal scams and legitimate projects
346187,me and my team are probably going
346188,yes i understand large part is the sentiment but there are a smaller portion of investors who do understand the value under each token and in my innocent thoughts those should be the few who still holds and believe in the project looking at wonderland after everything i am still its holder
346189,why do you hold time
346190,dathalohorn effects basically
346193,i still believe in daniele in the project how they survive through that storm i am just curious how things will play out
346194,aiiiight its a wrap too much sharing some stuff things get lost dumb convos
346195,wait they mean not the deso guy thingy but jeff de la cream scammer farm
346196,sorry was just asking
346197,when do we start worrying sers
346198,90
346199,never
346200,this amount in there is tiny piece of real usdt
346201,100 milly swap is 0001 slippage
346203,this is usdc and dai though not usdt
346204,i am dumb it misclicked sorry
346205,as i was taking schreeenshot
346206,yeah np i was just worried what will happen if usdt goes to 90 of the reserves and above
346207,250milly nets 59k usd 0025
346208,saw it at 70 a few hours ago now 76
346209,got it ser thank you hope it stays pegged
346210,echo chambers they didnt listen to anyone with dissenting views no token can remain pegged when its peg relies on the value of another token the ust was only ever meant to stay pegged under teh assumption that luna would always remain in demand when the house of cards tumble it will all come crashing downnow thats not saying ust cant regain peg just remember the majority of bag holders took a good swift kick to the gut on this one it can regain peg users can begin holding again but eventually the house of cards will again tumble and all bag holders will get a swift kick to the gut eventually no new users will be willing to get kicked in the gut by the rollercoaster ponzi and it will come crashing down
346211,3pool is like 1 of usdc usdt dai supply nothing ot worry about here curve is not a critical peg factor as it is for other stables like ust or mim
346221,deleting all blabla fuckers will ban you
346222,looks like the charles rumour is confirmed false
346223,all those conspiracy stories seem retarded they always are
346224,a dude fucking a whales wife and all that stuff always dumb
346225,hi sers is there a way to check how much of supply of eth is in nfts defi 20 staking etc
346226,at least that one was funny this one is just standard boring conspiracies
346227,heres a simulation for usdt spot price add 00003 to get sellbuy price compared brand new a5000 vs old a2000 pool used to have coins 3 fee 3 bp usdt 2000 5000 800 09933 09973 825 09902 09960 850 09846 09938 875 09741 09894 900 09513 09798 925 08939 09541 950 07219 08630
346228,fuck still looks like shit on mobile
346229,thank you
346230,nan
346231,what is a in these simulations
346232,amplification coefficient
346233,thank you sir
346234,i hope this article helps too it explains the other parameters
346235,balancers docs do have an awesome gif explaining the effect of a on the swap curve
346236,article explains it really well thank you
346241,btw its related to
346242,will luna be susceptible to the 51 attack since the validator can just buy enough luna now and stake them which allow them to have the majority
346243,theres nothing really to gain in doing this at this point is there
346244,the assets on terra is worth a lot they can just change the recipient address to their own wallet
346245,correct me if im wrong
346246,lol luna price measured in ust too
346247,since it only take about 200m to get this done
346248,you probably cant submit invalid txns as a validator to terra
346249,which is clearly quite possible with the loans
346250,but what if you have 51 vote
346251,i dont know about terra specifically but generally you cannot submit or confirm outright invalid txns even with 51 of the network but it depends on how finality works on that chain
346252,what about proposals
346253,if onchain governance is run by validators then of course you can pass whatever you want with enough stake
346254,we got addresses holding nfts for eth locked staking see pic
346255,nan
346256,since its definitely more valuable right now to actually rug the entire assets on terra
346257,theres the steth on anchor
346258,afaik the issue with trying a 51 attack is that you need to lock your luna for some time
346259,so if attack fails you are stuck with locked luna
346260,21 day unbonding period afaik
346261,yea but he can probbably hedge his funds
346262,and i believe many are unstaking their funds now so by the end of 21 days the total amount staked will be much lesser on luna
346263,making this more easier
346268,nan
346270,kill my yields
346271,when i started my farming it cost 5500
346273,its 230 collat rnso eth has to be like below 1k for it to lose 11 redeemability
346274,plus theyve stables
346278,fei collateralized by lusdmb most interesting ponzi stable
346285,thing is the lusd is again backed by eth so it really depends on the strength of their stability pool if eth crash a lot bad debt for lusd further pressure on fei
346286,eu commission favors ban on largescale stablecoins document shows link
346290,how much of defi is freezable fiatcoins
346292,its the same deleveraging we experienced last year the only difference is this time the leverage is onchain
346294,question 8
346296,stability pool ensures that there will be fast liquidations but if its drained redeems will nonetheless work and support lusd at least at 1 minus redeem fees 055 depends on the frequency of redeemsso as i understand it stability pool helps but is not necessary
346297,nan
346298,banned deleted account that person really spammed the f out of the chat
346299,this doesnt seem like an educated reply imho then you might as well say this for maker its basically sai v1
346300,see dune
346301,coindesk title is dumb af but then again they are known for sensationalized titles to farm views the comission wants to cap issuance of stablecoins tougher approach and the parliament wants to put stablecoins under european banking authority oversight softer approach neither of them is talking about banning shit
346302,both liquity and maker are onchain leverage for eth the stability pool comment is backed by the market dymanics of the lusd why would it depeg from below during a down market
346303,dont tell me what to do
346304,ill vaguepost all day
346305,or will i
346306,hmmmmm
346307,my issue here is with defisavers automation theres less incentive to stay in the sp it becomes weak what happens if the sp runs out of funds bad debt might be wrong just my thoughts
346308,yo guys
346309,gas wise its usually cheaper to do multiple require statements instead of a big require with multiple s right
346310,big require should be cheaper
346311,thanks ill double check on tests anyway
346312,require is essentially some logic statement evaluation cheap and revert logic expensive
346314,so its better to have just one big statement
346315,what happens if the stability pool is empty when liquidations occur if the stability pool is empty the system uses a secondary liquidation mechanism called redistribution in such a case the system redistributes the debt and collateral from liquidated troves to all other existing troves the redistribution of debt and collateral is done in proportion to the recipient troves collateral amount
346316,got it makes sense thank you
346317,
346318,hi guys i just made an anlysis of the past ribbon finance liquidity mining on univ3 i think its kinda interesting like 1 guy made 20 of all rewards by cleverly managing liquidity on univ3
346319,revert had some great analysis postlp mining for ribbon as wellalso some other discussions on ct etc
346320,can you share the link
346321,theres a discussion with zef and dan rob abt pool2 with uni v3 mining being a bad idea
346322,ye let me try to find
346323,
346324,5 months ago
346325,yeah i saw some protocols are just doing the unleveraged liquidity for univ3 these days
346326,
346327,old fud is new fud
346330,this is sweet what viz library did you use for the gifs
346331,thanks this one
346332,yeah thats a good one i also thought that the protocol actually gives away tokens for small amount of liquidity but in reality it turned our that its just gained some eth while the rewards was dumped to the other side of the pool
346333,if your corner of the internet was praising terra i suggest you reconsider who you listen to ser a lot of reasonable people have been expressing concerns about terra for monthsi think i became too scared to touch it after reading crvs risk assessment team report
346334,
346335,3 man team raise 2m from this list holy
346336,nan
346337,yo de fuk is happening w curve
346339,bahahahaha
346340,these 2 are fine
346341,nan
346342,theres a bunch of eth on anchor polynya has some good tweets on the topic
346343,its a boomer stable de fuk is going on michwill sseereeer
346344,thats what happen when people dont understand what they use they buy into ust then panic sell boomer stables lol
346345,wheres the defi education fund when we need them the most
346346,ye seems like that panic flee from 3crv it seems as a whole
346347,have you looked at the bytecode generated my guess is that the statement compiles into the evm equivalent of a bne and then revert multiple s would just result in more bne instructions and less unexecuted revert instructionsit could potentially reduce the code size slightly if the compiler is naive because you wont have the bytecode for the reverts and revert reasons but the gas cost should be essentially the same
346348,this is what happens when noone is around to bribe for the gauge
346349,their gauge getting depleted
346350,5 apr for it on convex why would ppl put in stables there
346351,idk when the last time you checked apys on anything fam
346352,
346353,no bribes no peg unless some chad like mich himself or tetra vote with their vecrvcvx
346354,btw has anyone used the fixed forex ib stable to mim swapper from is it all fine works as expected no funny business
346355,i think you are wrong ser take ust3crv pool as an example having bribes 15 weight but finally lose the peg
346356,i wanna check but cannot open the page
346357,doesnt load ser
346358,my internet is ass so idk if its the website or me
346359,well keep chipping away at it until something works reminds me of the digital cash naysayers before bitcoin bitcoin was indeed possible for many years before it was invented a novel combination of several alreadyexisting inventions
346360,yes but the situation is very different with stablecoins we are in the unknown unknown territory bitcoin had a lot of knowns
346362,true but those knowns were found via experiments with them when they were unknown
346363,looks like the same
346365,it makes some sense yet at the same time its a very odd thing to attempt youre trying to hedge away risk in both systems from the dollar side inflation in cefi systems is an issue as is government instability on the crypto side instability in crypto systems continues to be an issue from one perspective crypto is extremely volatile relative to usd from another perspective usd is extremely volatile relative to crypto eventually that line will be crossed where people see usd volatile relative to crypto likely with onchain assets as their primary reference point and at that point youve suddenly gone from optimizing for cryptobased risk to needing to optimize for fiatbased risk its a really difficult balancing act to strike properly
346366,honestly i didnt but we need an exact code to figure this out further the thing is besides the actual revert instruction its also returning the error string logic which is far more expensive than booleans evaluations
346367,right but all of that happens on the other side of the branch instruction
346368,its just syntactic sugar for if condition revertreason
346369,if condition evaluates to false we dont execute any of the expensive revert logic including the string return etc
346370,so its just code were jumping over which has a nonzero cost in terms of size and cache locality but afaik jump instructions do not cost differing amounts of gas based on the absolute value of the program counter incrementdecrement
346371,from another perspective usd is extremely volatile relative to cryptowell all be dead before that is true beyond shillfluencer narratives and even if that doesnt happen there will be bigger things to worry about should it happen
346372,and any reasonable branch prediction will have started speculatively executing based on the assumption that a require is just a sanity check and will not revert so we shouldnt even really lose cachepipeline except in the exceptional case at which point we were already going to spend a bunch of extra resources processing the revert
346373,well yes and no change can come very quickly and very unexpectedly just because the current paradigm has help for 80 years doesnt mean it cannot change extremely rapidly you are right it would cause a lot of instability though
346374,yeah people are gonna look at ust and say algosbad but as bad as they may be you could hardly design a better trojan horse than the fiatcoins and their various glorified wrappers that are somehow now top 10 and 3 of them
346375,i think even in case of nonreverts big require should still be cheaper because jumpi costs 10 gas and costs 3 gas but like i said a specific example is needed
346376,you cant and them all together in one instruction though
346377,simple example of 3 operands a b c
346378,if a b false then we dont need to do c so thats a jumpi
346379,if b c false we still need to jumpi out
346380,in fact youre wasting more instructions now that i lay it out like this
346381,because the compiler should generate code that goes if a false exit else if a b false exit else if b c false exit else revert
346382,so youve saved nothing
346383,the only case in which you save anything is if all of the operands are already loaded and it really is just a sequence of ands and then a final check of the value
346384,if you would benefit at all from short circuiting then it should end up about the same
346385,i suppose i have written all these words and then realized we are talking about revert so the more likely case is that we are checking if a bunch of things are true and if one of them isnt we revert in that case i think youre right because the short circuiting leads us to revert at which point who cares whether we wasted any gas on ands
346386,as you said we have to see the actual code to know whether any particular way is better or worse
346387,hey guys anyone knows an api for yields i know about vfat working on a version but might take time its publicthe only other solution i see is to scratch data manually but wanted to know if there is something easier to work with
346388,hmm defilamma has yields in the website but not sure if its exposed in an api
346389,hmm no their api does not have the yields yet
346390,oh interesting uhm maybe they didnt update their docs yet might be worth to ask thanks ser
346391,anyone know any good articletwitter thread about lunaust how it works and why it collapsed
346392,yearn gives apy estimations in their api thats what defillama reads at least for yearn
346393,its not an estimation its a historical average
346394,apy is a very tender subject because so many protocols calculate it differently
346395,its very easy for staking contracts like masterchef but when it comes to vaults with discrete harvests you can only use historical averages even those will be inaccurate depending on harvest frequency volatility and use case
346396,lots of protocols ignore all these details and just generate bullshit numbers that mean nothing
346398,nan
346399,this is useful to understand the mechanisms
346400,usdcusdt wicked to 4 on binance frax is at 098
346401,the general idea of the death spiral is that depeg put sells pressure on luna which can result in the mcap of ust exceeding luna
346402,what is that platform for buyingselling governance votes
346403,or delegating it
346404,hidden hand
346405,
346406,we do this at paladin
346407,awesome thanks everyone lemme know if there are others
346408,there is quite a lot tbh competition has been ramping up
346409,coindixcom
346410,i think they have an api
346411,btc mempool coming alive we havent been at these levels since may 2021
346412,
346413,we dont have a public api we just launched and atm apis are pretty unstable so waiting for some stability to open them but if you are okay with using an api that might just break some day you can use
346414,just be aware that its very likely to get rugged with nonbackwardscompatible changes
346415,
346416,laaaaaarp
346418,did he knew smth we didnt
346419,nah he dumped coin every day
346420,rekt and fucked the books all year
346421,also with eth 2k and ust 7 does that count as ust recovering
346422,its not like luna being unsustainable was a secret
346423,just think basically everyone was caught off guard by the sheer speed
346424,i dont like what coinbase did last year but i actually think coin is a really good investment right now
346425,please make all curve pool parameters a 1000infinite0000 so we can be happy
346426,he tweeted that at 063 cent ust so no
346427,i posted sarcastic
346428,omg nic
346429,harold
346430,anchor front ends incorrectly claiming that ust is overcollateralized
346431,to be fair they are overcollateralised in the sense of their collateral beth bluna is overcollateralised against the ust
346432,isnt that true for anchor
346433,i think thats very misleading though
346434,not that ust itself is collateralised
346435,this faq is about backingsecurity of deposit
346436,i think its unfortunately reality maybe they can add a note there that ust is an algo stablecoin
346437,talking about loan overcollateralization is answering the wrong question
346438,reminder to myself when a l1 blockchain dies all the projects built on it die as well
346439,something to consider for devs choosing which chain to build on
346440,hopefully many projects received grants and teams can now have a beach retirement without finishing the work
346441,very sad if devs used their own funds
346442,that would be you
346443,lmao no but im hoping the same thing as you love to see hard working devs win
346444,preach habibi
346445,lmfao
346446,
346447,
346448,the rest remains unchanged pretty much it seems
346449,
346450,ig context is
346451,tragic
346452,only thing you can do at a time like this is build
346453,that and shitpost in the nftonly group
346455,may i know where u find that report beside that report is there any useful credible documents i could educate myself i need to stop listening to all kol om twitter and youtube yep they all praise on luna and for a while i thought it has substance
346456,what happens to unclaimed transactions on the xdai omnibridge
346457,generally speaking is there some way to avoid requiring manual user action on the amb the guides on tokenbridgenet imply that bridge fees will be taken out of the value being bridged
346458,cryptocurrency trader sentenced to 42 months
346459,was the sorbet finance bug fixed can i remove liquidity without the risk of being drained
346460,do kwon is holding a very uncertain fate right now he advocated a stablecoin pegged to usd
346461,he created an algo stable coin little different than theft
346462,the sec already sued do kwon he sued them back if i remember correctly people need to take some responsibility for their choices
346463,exactly
346464,wdym
346465,solved i was talking about this
346467,thats like 5 years ago in crypto time
346469,almost gave me a heart attack mate
346470,me too coz arrakis
346471,he promised a stablecoin with a 11 dollar parity he will be surely held accountable for the stablecoin part and a collective lawsuit is likely to unfold just like mt gox imo
346472,but muh promises but muh accountability
346473,seriously do kwon might be arrogant but ive seen nothing that says hes a scammer he built an algo stablecoin which failed under a bank run it sucks for everyone that lost money and its bear market so we all have our pitchforks but its not a crime
346474,lfgs market operations arent particularly transparent its not a 100 algocoin
346475,usdt is safe
346476,its not even about whether he is a scammer or not its whether some circles want to kill this project whether the project itself is resilient against attacks it is notthere are plenty of bullshit reasons which may claim that do broke the law and it probably is very difficult to defend there
346477,probably as unsafe as the actual usd us economy is same is about usdc perhaps
346478,why people are swapping usdt to usdc busd
346479,and on 3pool crv usdt taken 80 pool
346480,can make a case there was a lot of false advertising involved
346481,good question but i dont think there are unnatural reasons theremaybe usdc and busd are easier to redeem and people do that
346482,there are many things really but i wont write here to not give sec clues they do have all the clues though i am sure and they are annoyed by arrogance
346483,the scam is not recognizing the risks and berating those who called them out
346484,well theres really little area of use for usdt in ethereum defi for instance you cant use it as collateral in aave v2 havent tried v3 not sure about it
346485,there is an old drama about tether not being 100 backed
346486,but in short imo problem is the ust design where redeeming to luna makes luna drop in price really fast which can make ust underbacked and incentivize to redeem faster
346487,so if people want to open short positions on chain they would prefer something they can use as collateral
346488,many were sounding the alarm on ust for a while now im fairly confident that all the lunatics including do believed ust was resilient
346489,oh yeah and theres this d
346490,not so little actually so idk
346491,how is drinking your own koolaid a scam
346492,yeah they did
346493,most pools with deep liquidity are either with usdc or dai on ethereum at least
346494,usdtwbtceth is pretty deep on curve
346495,well dont know then maybe people are scared and remembered the old fud around tether
346496,and stablecoin liquidity for usdt is also big
346497,old fud yes
346498,which will be the next short coin
346499,i would bet on the 100 meme coins like doge or shiba
346500,wagmi doesnt protect a protocol if a protocol builder doesnt understand that they shouldnt be building
346501,shorttrend begin
346502,by that same measure shouldnt the people that bought in not understanding that not be buying or is it rules for thee but not for me
346503,using fomo and berating those who call out risks is scammy behavior
346504,its hubris not scammy
346505,if thats the standard for scam then 9999 of this space is filled with scammers
346506,no shit
346507,once upon a time you had compound and uniswap grandstand about how they were pristine because they had no dirty tokens
346508,during the thick of the ico frenzy defi was berated too
346509,many have fallen whose still around
346510,senpai its not a scam because you didnt like his choice of words
346511,its not words its behavior
346512,this is the worst part of the bear market for me when personal accountability gets thrown out the window fomo is a choice you make
346513,whos fomoing into ust it was marketed as a safe place to get yield lol
346514,i wasnt in it but just sayin probably room for some accountability here
346515,stablecoin with a guaranteed 20 yield when others were giving sub 5
346516,adult thinking person puts life savings in crypto thing based on the marketing rather than well the manual hmm deposit your money into atlantiseth to receive a ticket to the lost island only deposits above 1 eth or more accepted
346517,people do stupid shit which is why regulators have jobs
346518,theres a market for people like that
346523,bot
346524,uhhhhh
346525,should we be worried
346526,cause thats either a pricing anomaly or tether is losing the peg too
346527,saw another tweet about that too
346528,
346529,usdn seems to have depegged
346530,larping too much
346531,yeah seemed a bit cray
346532,oh wow thats a pretty scary thought
346533,lmao the peep is going after any stablecoin after its project went downhill
346534,lunatics are the new karens
346535,yeah everyone is exchanging for usdc
346536,this guy isnt a trader he was a ico pool operator
346537,stop posting this trash
346538,i imagine usdt is under pressure probably due to the persistent lack of trust but off by 0005 happens basically every day
346539,these are worse than doomsday cultists
346540,abandon all hope
346541,ivangbi bot
346542,god damn too many ivans in here thats for sure a bad sign
346543,this is an actual depeg happening
346544,sorry ser i am redact
346545,its ok bo
346546,last few days seem to have melted my brain
346547,let it soak in
346548,your witnessing history
346549,i cant do anything
346550,when your hologram grandkids ask you about this you will recount most likely an inaccurate portrayal of events
346551,they will be too busy doing whatever the fuck they do on euphoria to care
346552,evolution supports pessimists not optimists this means that we react to fud more strongly compared to hope fud doesnt build anything it only destroys everything in society is build on trust and fud erodes trust br eternal optimist
346553,today it has become critical to allow fluid connectivity between different chains and the solution to this is blockchain interoperability one of the prominent blockchains that are leading blockchain interoperability is cosmos how lets dive in
346554,this maybe silly question but doesn anyone have an explanation how come over 50 of circulating tether is in tron blockchain 42 btronscan shows that tvl is 85b
346555,its cheap as fuck to move large amounts of tether there
346556,its cheap to move large amounts of tether on any chain its cheap to move small amounts on tron though but it still doesnt make sense to me also been wondering this
346557,is there a way to earn yield there or its just all sitting around in wallets
346558,
346559,oldie but a goodie
346560,tron had an incentive program to move tether to their blockchain something crazy like 10 but without a smart contract people took the bait and it was postponed and delayed and it was said to be about tether fud i think they did pay at the end
346561,hi everyone
346562,ok thanks for the explanation
346569,usdc strategy people want to cash out redeem fees
346570,haha all u need is a george sorus type run on the british pound to remind the alleged stability of any currency is a mind game of faith in future
346571,its all connected
346572,maybe gold
346573,hard goods commodities as an anchor as advocated by zoltan poszar of credit swiss in his note
346574,i use tron to move usdt across exchanges fast and cheap
346575,
346576,usdt is moved through tron to arb between exchanges afaik
346577,but having 50 of supply there to just wait for arb opps sus
346578,id rather make an assumption that maybe its money that would be deemed dirty in the bank world
346579,so maybe they dont care that much about apys
346580,its not waiting there ser its on exchanges ser
346581,exchange addresses
346582,also for some time tron was the favorite network for moving tether around cheaper and faster at the exchanged i worked at the volume was crazy high compared to other networks
346583,thx stupid me
346584,anybody got any theories on why f2pool is mining empty blocks rn do they hate money
346585,is tether depegging or what
346586,already depegged
346587,nan
346588,lol
346589,you still can redeem it in tether i dont think thats called depeg
346590,can it be called arbitrage opportunity
346591,usdc and dai are now 102 while usdtdai is 097 on binance
346592,i think it is arb opportunity i remember someone from alameda said they love doing this kind of arb
346593,they still get the mining reward
346594,
346595,how can be there is empty blocks why there is no tx
346596,
346597,this is irrelevant in btc the block contains a tx from coinbase to miner and is required by the protocol eth is different
346598,sure f2pool still gets the eth mining reward but i guess they dont care about tx fees they seem to only be mining mev txs maybe mev is drying up right now cause gas prices too high that doesnt make sense to me tho
346599,good day sers if tether hypothetically dpeggs 5 095 usd and i have an open leverage position x20 how does is affect it for example if i long x and x only falls by 3 am i in 2 profite still
346600,i would not hold any dervs with usdt
346601,yeah but binance futures are mainly in usdt
346602,they have usd and busd
346603,busd is paxos
346604,so theoreticaly better
346605,1busd 104usdt already just doesnt make sense
346606,not the same pairs more pairs are on usdt but how the liquidation is affected by a change in the value of the base pair
346607,people are currently fleeing usdt so busd dai and usdc are going up
346608,i guess is kind of ok for any leverage under 20x
346609,wait how will a tether depeg work theoretically unless and until its proven that tether isnt 100 backed by usd and equivalent in value shouldnt 1 usdt be always redeemable for 1 usd
346610,everyone know this already
346611,no one knows the extent
346612,a good reading material would be first tether depeg that was in 2018 if i recall correctly
346613,this is the official and audited info
346614,funds not safuisland banks closedsmth like that is the most likely scenario
346615,think and believe of it what you want
346616,huge arbitrages opportunities errywhere
346617,yep now imagine being in the office
346618,
346619,tether has lots of commerical paper essentially unsecured loans that they have given to companies such as bitfinex if these companies default then you dont get your usd back
346620,36 of holdings are commercial paper ceritficates of deposit
346621,yesterday i posted about usdt depeggin and some1 deleted my message
346622,it goes worse
346623,atleast you have a job mcdonalds fired me today coz i threw fries on some guy who was doing ta on ust
346624,yep but wfh so much better
346625,even if theyre fully collateralised im not sure how liquid that tether collateral is if there is a bank runa lot of redemptions at the same time
346626,but yes its no ust where majority of collateral is your own governance token worth near 0
346627,this is outdated
346628,usdc is backed by cash and gov bonds only now
346629,is it true that usdt is only backed by btc and they just pay fines
346630,do we have an updated breakdown
346631,yep but my point is as long as tether lets you redeem 1 usdt for 1 usd and doesnt stop their larp its just pool imbalance that should be fixed via arbs not really depeg
346632,usdt depegged liquidation short vcs and mms could sell crypto assets with higher price in usdt redeem usdt 1 at tether
346633,this is a total dirty game
346634,omfg is this a joke
346635,i knew the pump would come
346636,nan
346637,tiktok investors were right usdc 5
346638,10
346639,lmao
346640,when will ivan cash out and to which stable
346641,even stables ivan is rekt
346642,i have all my money in lusd
346643,you mean lsd right
346644,more or less hilarious though ust truly shocked the normies
346645,i die
346646,i cant believe this
346647,
346648,isnt tether fully collateralised unnecessary panic well be back at 1 in no time im buying the dip
346649,
346650,tbh if do kwon is able to kill all stablecoins with one move i will accept him as master of stables
346651,unstable kwon
346652,lmao im dead
346653,8 arbitrage on avalanche chain and binance on usdcusdt pair crazy times
346654,if u are afraid of the usdt depeg buy some eth
346655,tether goes to 033 so bitcoin is at 100k
346656,all part of a plan guys
346657,
346658,
346659,bear market has the best memes to be honest people get more creative than up only
346660,yeah only good side of bear market
346661,anyone else notice a discrepancy between oracle pricing on aave vs cex pricing
346662,i ve seen a tiktok video where the guy was mentioning a 23x potential for usdt
346664,i was saying this earlier
346666,kraken futures just went unwindcounterparty on my position did they run out of money
346668,can the depeg gate affect tethers plans in lugano
346669,
346670,tether depeg is just volatility every tether is redeemable prices off peg are a market maker problem insufficient depth for the demand for tether until tether say otherwise
346671,usdt collateral mix is all going to hell maybe that has something to do with what is going on sunac chinese re company missing bond payments
346672,can the devs do something
346673,can everyone just stop selling
346674,blez
346676,should check deltec bank tether issuance rerserve last 31 dec 20217bn liquid cash money market funds345bn treasury bills24bn cert of deposit
346677,given the level of understanding of most crypto users i wouldnt be suprised if some of them confused usdt with ust
346678,absolutely
346679,so yesterday was newbie fud and now is real huh
346680,rest assured there are few of these already
346685,can we please not do conspiracy pleb theories
346686,ye also china gdp debt is very relevant of course sorry stop
346687,this is why us wants to regulate stables if usdt faces bank run and it holds treasury notes that means that market is flooded with them bad for uncle sam
346690,thank u for refueling i can sleep now
346691,now that ust is basically gone mim is super shady and has danimaybe people actually look back at working systemsfrax dola and obviously dai seems to work pretty good
346692,fxs took a massive hit despite frax being stable
346693,should be a good buy once the dust settles it
346694,everything tookinv from dola toothink mkr is the only coin up on that market event while it probably is the last benefiting governancestable combo in terms of stable value mkr
346695,they also got clout from that freight deal in apac yeah but how did anyone pay attention to that amidst the general chaos no idea
346696,link pls
346697,mim also works it was better than most if not all during the stress testing periods
346698,theyre coming for you ivangbi
346699,how do the mechanisms for dai frax usdc tether compare if they face a run are there significantly different liquidationredemption triggers for example
346700,muh research fuck u
346701,absolutely all different the ones that you mentioned
346702,ye but dani projects would be the least i safely trust
346703,backed irl cash reserves or promises blabla notes or some other chinese bills was case w tether wasnt itonchain algo ha or not multicollateral or no etc
346704,
346706,sorry i know its a newbie question i know that dai is overcollateralised so as the eth price falls there will be increased collateral liquidation is there anyone that might have modeled this scenario for various stables im imagining a graph showing resiliencyelasticity against sell force maybe revealing some shelves
346707,there are 100s of such graphs most likely some are proprietary firms have probably lets see if anyone shar
346708,maker handles liquidations well they have the psm module too check the documentation
346709,
346710,
346711,
346712,influenza is about the nicest name ive heard ivan called for a while
346713,k o l
346714,what do you guys think of the probably of coinbase andor robinhood going bankrupt
346715,why go bankrupt if u can downsize the team by a lot
346716,we dont know their exposures
346717,theyll get bailed out faster than the airlines too much at stake
346718,im not sure about that
346719,mev bots killing it rn
346720,
346721,justin adding to the liquidity pool
346722,its a huge worry tbh
346723,wait wheres this coinbase bankruptcy rumour coming from been seeing it a lot the past 24h but no actual sources
346724,justin still have 216b in this wallet the one from which he pulled out 4b from aave few months back
346725,a bit offtopic but may interest youeventhorizontelescopeorgblogeventhorizontelescopecollaborationannouncegroundbreakingmilkywayresultsmay12th
346726,1 people sharing their ts about having users as creditors if there is a bankruptcy 2 uncertainty around their exposure to crypto derivatives 3 their share prices tanking for months way below ipo price
346727,for robinhood im not sure i dont know how exposed they are to crypto
346728,nan
346729,right aliens now we get visitors right after we became poor great
346730,so effectively its all just a big rumourspeculation of what ifs and maybe thisthat
346731,already
346732,their balance sheet looks quite healthy for fy21 at least
346733,referring to this discussion maybe
346734,completely
346736,gmx is building an amm which have customisable lp pools based on conditions
346737,can usdc in scs be frozen or clawedback
346738,yes
346739,yes they can blacklist contracts
346740,can be frozen and destroyed
346741,but why it cant be destroyed if its in an lp
346742,who said it cant
346744,it can but itll freeze and fuck up the whole pool
346745,originates from coinbase making a statement that has the world bankruptcy in it
346746,during earnings they just laid out guidance for all risks thats all
346747,oh so they dont do it because else everyone holding the lp would get destroyed too right
346748,thry basically said if they go bankrupt the crypto held will not be given back
346749,yeah imagine usdc blacklisting the 3pool contract would be a total mess
346750,since their stocl took a dive
346751,just a statement they have to make from compliance pov
346752,pr department probably dying rn
346753,got a link
346754,ok now i get it so this is why no one came up with a wusdc i guess
346755,if gmx goes down to single digit i will sell my house and buy more quite literally
346756,why does it matter why they did it you know if coin goes bankrupt and you have money held there you wont get it back
346757,the definition of not your wallet not your crypto is coinbases crypto also while we are at it fuck coinbasei feel sorry for us citizens who are forced to use that crap due to politicians getting bribed left and right
346758,
346759,thx
346760,theres a guy who believes it could who knows what will happen haha
346761,gmx has some of the best tokenomics for retail and team literally saw vcs reject it coz the vesting meant they wouldnt make money early enough
346762,
346763,anyways anybody have any clue why tether depegged so violently also why did ust unpeg did we ever get an answer to that other than the joke 4chan post
346764,well anything could happen during these crazy times
346765,any tool out there to create delta neutral positions using uniswap v3
346767,i know another protocol making 2million monthly profits and at 20m fdv rn market is so much tempting right now damn sam blz lend me your stables
346768,tether peg is maintained by market maker and liquidity on a given market
346770,price on exchange has no bearing on price at redemption
346771,why arent people arbing then
346772,sure ser but let me buy first
346773,with what exactly
346774,if tether is on the orderbook for btcusdt for example its not on the same orderbook as usdcusdt
346775,theyre independent markets
346776,and btc is risky right now
346777,i made 45k in arbs since morning binance and other l1s using 15k capital i wish i would have learned mev on time
346778,with usd
346779,because usd is slow the arb opportunity might not exist after youve managed to deposit etc
346780,id include a comparison to onchain svgs early since saying nfts arent even links to pictures isnt really accurate either i usually explain it as nfts are not pictures but some include pictures or links to pictures separating futureproofing from whatisannft explaining bleeps also helps people start asking the right questions
346781,buy 100 usd worth of usdt 100xredeem 100x usdt for 100x usdx profit
346782,fair
346783,you cant redeem 100 usdt anyway
346784,wait no
346785,the 11 redemption with tether has a minimum transaction size
346786,alright so why dont whales do it with a milly
346787,because whales dont want their out of the game
346788,waiting for funds to arrive in their bank only to deploy again
346789,what
346790,that doesnt make sense
346791,thats right i thought about this particular case too but then decided to have something more accessible to the public
346792,sure it does to redeem tether its not instant requires kyc and payments could be like 35 working days
346793,whereas youd argue in peak volatility the opportunity to make exists the most
346794,do you think then it is reasonable to say it will repeg in 35 days
346795,depends how long btc gets crushed for
346796,you would still get more usdt than usd worth
346797,btcusdt is one of the highest volume pairs
346798,doesnt matter how long it takes to get in the bank
346799,rook holder eventually going to be wealthy after years of rekt lol
346800,all you need to understand is tether dont control their pegthe market makers do
346801,if theres insufficient depth on markets for the demand to exit to tether the tether price will vary
346802,but this does not change the fact tether is backed by and you can redeem tether for directly with them
346803,what do you mean by depth
346804,not that its that hard to grasp but i thought that the scope of the thread should focus on a general explanation rather than including exceptions thanks for the comment btw i appreciate it
346805,depth of the orderbook on the exchange
346806,if someone market sells 1m of usdt into usdc for example and theres only 900k of usdc in bids on the order book at 09999 usd it will start to fill orders lower down which reports the lower price of execution
346807,you need to understand an orderbook is not unlimited demand or unlimited liquidity
346808,if theres no counterparty bids for your order at the price you want it doesnt get filled or it gets filled lower in the case of a market order
346809,what r u even guys arguing about
346810,i think thats enough
346811,tether off peg ser
346812,jpeg season to dpeg season sirs
346813,they totally should be building everybody should be building always but the community failed in giving a ponzi credence vcs speaker opportunities journalists ust as collateral everyone just treated it like who am i to judgecompare hex few take it seriously and ironically has been more stable and for longer
346814,anyone
346815,jib0xd ugolinod
346816,if i may propose a brief distraction could anyone pls eli5 the difference between the omni layer and rootstock as far as i can tell rsk use cases are a superset of the omni layer the latter just enables custom asset creation but without a vm for smart contract execution is this correct
346817,the most scary thing in this bear market is that hex still has 80bn market cap
346818,we have time to continue cleaning the market
346819,cant sell if its locked
346820,at this point is ust becoming impossible to repeg
346821,the luna behind each ust is worth 125 cents herere the apis for the live circulating supply of luna ust
346822,it is never impossible technically the question is if you can get billions of buy volume into luna but yeah it has been highly unlikely to repeg for a while now
346823,please stop trading everyone
346824,they proposing to burn all the ust in treasury
346825,thats just 1b ust
346826,
346827,that are bought with the btc everyone was hoping to replace the luna as collateral
346828,remove 1b from the ust circulation and you end up with 11b
346829,
346830,not great
346831,luna should jump over 17
346832,which is 6000 from here
346833,6000 from the point where the vote actually passes
346834,no i am referring to the circ supply of lunaprice market cap of ust
346835,my calc might be wrong but it is becoming ever more uncollaterized by the hour meaning price falls faster than the dilution which is generally a bad thing
346836,cant buy luna in bulk on binance anymore
346839,you can buy on kraken they have just two prices left
346840,need more decimals
346843,
346844,nonono too late justin f uuuuuu
346845,no one is gonna stop justin sun from replicating the bullshit do kwon just did
346846,oh do kwon did that i can do it too
346847,ust is dead long live usdd which is exactly like ust but for next bear market
346849,if it is initially collateralized by 10b as he said at the beginning no disclosure yet except for the half a bil put by alameda is not the same risk at least at the beginning
346850,they gonna offer 30 apy
346851,or so the rumours were i wonder if they gonna change any of that
346852,
346853,pretty good
346854,well to dilute a bit stablecoins fudthe idea lending lobster nft to gain yield for those who hodl 1 nftsaccess yo the offtopic chat for some interest rate on borrowed nft for those who doesnt own
346855,innit disrupting
346856,could the yield be in an algostable pegged to the dollar please
346857,preferably with a warchest of btc to defend it
346859,where can i buy lobster
346860,looksrare opensea
346861,ok
346862,
346864,this is dumb
346868,
346870,anyone done research on what the best mic webcam setup is
346871,blue yeti a dslr
346872,monkeyontheloose
346873,
346874,updated
346875,current ust supply is 12bn what do you think kwons target is to be able to cover it with collateral 23bn
346876,did binance delist luna
346877,just suspended withdrawals atm
346878,some things never change
346880,ctrlf some messages and questions are google worthy
346881,what is the best way to short ust
346882,perps are gone
346883,any wellknown dapp open source frontend thats not in react or angular
346884,nan
346885,flight to quality security on one chart
346888,compound finance iirc
346889,unlock happen at some point no otherwise why would you invest
346890,there are some in vue i believe
346891,heres one we did in svelte
346892,compound uses elm
346893,or used
346894,algo stablecoins are truly the killer apps of crypto in that they kill crypto
346895,
346896,for those that want to follow the stetheth oracle price
346897,nan
346898,looks all right
346899,a is fairly low there so 0995 is fine
346900,but i wonder how big are those leveraged staking positions
346901,hope someone tries to break the peg so i can get some free eth
346902,free steth
346903,same same but different
346904,wen pegbreaking daos
346905,oh wait ust was one
346906,1b now isnt it
346907,liquidations can start at 0973
346908,the actual price is 09789 chainlink gets updated every 2
346909,03 until the update
346910,tether has maintained its stability through multiple black swan events and highly volatile market conditions and even in its darkest days tether has never once failed to honour a redemption request from any of its verified customers tether will continue to do so which has always been its practice
346911,usdt fudders read this
346912,ahh i think not the worst
346913,pool is large right
346914,lets say its not the safest position to be in right now
346915,309keth705keth
346916,but it is large 2b on curve then also balancer etc
346917,2 billy in total
346918,
346919,yeah uhm i think if all of that 1b unwinds can be quite a discount
346920,14m my gosh
346921,yeah
346922,enough discounts for this week blz
346923,28b in aave
346924,can do discounts
346925,so anyone who wants fresh and shiny eth 20 can observe
346926,not all of them with the folding strat
346927,yeah right
346928,maybe it will hodl
346929,i think its okish
346930,like
346931,it will survive
346932,speaking of this pool why i see this when i have balance there
346933,sending this to my lps
346934,sounds familiar but i dont remember what was it
346935,forwarding
346936,are they in leverage position
346937,i think around 400k steth liquidatable between 097 and 086 if anyone want to verify
346938,im dumb but wouldnt steth go back to peg fairly quickly even with all these potential liquidations
346939,depends on whether you want to buy a cheap steth 20
346940,does 0x have positive slippage
346941,there is no way to get a leverage over x33 on steth this means that leveraged steth positions can unravel for a long time before being at risk of liquidation no systemic risks from there 097 is not a target
346942,lmao
346943,since farm42 was interested this is the announcement
346944,is this the 0 that were going towards
346947,
346948,vague relevance has anyone elon thought about how interplanetary blockchains would operate since there would be time delay
346949,would be pretty ridiculous if blockchains are still relevant in such a future
346950,thats like still using smoke signals for intraplanetary communication
346951,has anyone thought about how intraplanetary blockchains are still relevant given how they currently operate
346952,like this
346953,much more interesting is the classic paper on interstellar trade what to do with interest rate check the author
346954,thanks
346955,hope yellen doesnt nuke us more
346956,
346957,remember them marketing positive slippage as a feature while bashing 1inch for not having so
346959,this is happening right now market still continuing for now though
346960,just ha e quantum entangled validators
346961,changed to 0005
346962,ah yeah they edited the announcement page i see
346963,at this rate 0005 will be reached in minutes 00083 rn
346964,inevitable since ust looks like it will never be pegged anytime soon
346965,used to able to via mirror not sure of current status difficult to advise you use this intermediary
346966,
346967,they are talking about getting stable coin regulations asap
346968,2billion for 30min
346969,do we have any insight into the exogenous collateral lfg sent to jump theres 0 transparency on that one so id assume they blew it since they would probably let us know they still hold multiple billions of collateral to move over to a collateralized model as promised in the thread
346971,lobsters hello can someone answer me luna prints a lot of tokens every minute where do they sell it in such quantity
346972,anywhere they can
346973,otc
346974,to market
346975,they need to sell it to recapitalise ust
346976,its the arbitrage mechanismust luna and i guess most sell on terra dexes or cexes
346977,i am curioushow much money would it take to pump ust to 1usd again
346978,personally have a feeling that jump had all the infra in place to arb the living shit out of it and theyll come out of it unscathed
346979,just speculating though
346980,but why they keep ust destroy it let build again with luna
346981,not money but rather stupidity and to answer your question a lot
346982,lfg airdrop luna for ust hodlers
346983,ye i know but idk how they can sell it in such quantity 23b for 30minutes omg
346984,ust has a circulating supply of 1212b it has a market cap of 74b to restore peg 1212b 74b 472b of ust needs to be burned terra validators have overwhelmingly agreed that this is what must be done ust must be burned and peg must be restored to burn ust and restore peg you need to mint new luna to burn 1 ust you need to mint 100 worth of luna lets do some simple math say we can burn all the excess ust all at once right now and restore peg to burn this 47b of ust we would need to mint 47b worth of luna at the current price of luna 003 this means we would have to mint 156b luna in this scenario the circulating supply of luna would increase from 35b to 160b increase 45x the price of luna will decrease to 00006 now you could in theory begin to slowly burn down that 160b circulating supply of luna does this sound impossible and like a terrible investment it should sound impossible and like a terrible investment the scenario described above is a made up fantasy and is not possible whats really going to happen is actually infinitely worse first problem you cant burn all 47b ust at once because you cant mint 156b luna at once there is a limit on how much luna can be minted in one day right now they are voting to increase the limit this leads us to problem 2 second problem as you mint luna the price of luna goes down luna is diluted which means to burn more ust you need to mint even more luna until you descend into a vicious feedback loop of all out luna minting madness this is referred to by validators and people who understand the protocol as the death spiral right now you can burn 1b ust by minting 33b luna the circulating supply of luna goes from 35b to 385b the price of luna is now 00027 you then burn your next 1b ust by minting 100000000000027 370b luna you burned your first 1b ust by minting 33b luna the next 1b ust by minting 370b luna the next 1b ust would take trillions and trillions of luna i used 1b chunks just as an example obviously the size of the burns would be much smaller as it depends on ust holders bags the point is luna cant recover unless they just decide to fundamentally change how the protocol works which would result in do kwan and everybody else on the project being instantly indicted for fraud they arent gonna go to prison to save your bags luna is going to 0 you were warned
346985,chainalysis announces 170m funding round platform now valued at 86 billionthis is the tenth and largest funding for the blockchain aggregation and reporting service since its inception in october 2014
346986,thats a lot of words to state what we already know
346987,gotta prepare for all the new compliancing
346988,you have generously optimistic assumptions about the target market
346989,they cant
346990,plus by the time this calculation finally reached us the luna supply increased to 331b luna already which is what it is now
346991,who will allow you to enter luna on the cexs if so much of it is printedalso input luna to cexs doesnt work
346992,i think lunas price is now below a psychological threshold for buyers pack it in
346993,sounds very logical thanks u where were you before
346994,binance futures will delist luna usdtmargined contract
346995,gemini currently has no otc borrow left to short usdt
346996,any euler finance team members i can contact i have a completed process quality review of the protocol id like to run by the team before we publish it

347005,
347006,lobster daily 408 daily recap 11 may1 your private channels are probably not as private if you use discordlink link to discussion 2 coinbase posts net loss of 430 million for q1 2022 link link to discussion 3 will frax lose peg or notlink link to discussion 4 tether has peg issueslink link to discussion 5 hows the 3pool by curve doinglink link to discussiondiscussions about luna ust1 soros style black wednesday attack of terralink link to discussion 2 are people keeping ust up by shorting it right now and buying it to do solink to discussion 3 should have been there regulationlink to discussion 4 is there any chance ust will be savedlink to discussion 5 is there a way to bring the peg back link link to discussion 6 what is next for lunalink to discussion
347007,lunalana will be delisted from binance futures
347008,
347009,they already made a mug to sell commemorating the crash that they themselves caused
347010,like this is the officiial store
347012,they need every dollar they can get now to restore that peg kek
347013,can some big brain eli5 why all markets is coupled to ust collapse in the beginning they still have btc reserve to defend peg so btc is coupled and the rest will dump based on coupling with btc but now that they are out of btc i guess only luna is coupled and will go to 0 why the rest is still correlated i can see there are arbs here and there and perhaps people are panicking so introducing irrational correlationis ust deeply used as collateral in other markets and defi protocols sorry did not really play and follow this ponzi if so only those pairing can be correlated and not the whole fking markets right so the dump is really due to irrational selling
347014,btc maxis where yall at realised losses 2nd largest in history
347015,ok mirror has a contract issue that isnt letting users withdraw rn stay out for now
347017,why all markets coupled to ust they arent ust well luna is the one that got rekt because of the market
347018,they also quietly launched a busd future contract lol
347019,
347021,well 40b value lost for funds and individuals some may be insolvent so they need to sell their other bags market knows this is going to happen so dump as well trying to front run it
347022,abit simplistic but yeah
347023,
347024,
347025,this reads very stupid and useless sorry
347026,they are emotionally coupled
347027,
347028,yes minting a tons of luna and get rekt
347029,i mean the idea of hard reset is not the worst one in terms of death spiral we are having right now parameters of reset is another story and if trust can be regained somehow
347030,because this is entirely a speculative market and no amount of fundamental can compensate for the fear so no bidders down only
347031,luna is 50 of what keeps ust alive theres a problem if lunas marketcap is less than usts especially in testy markets the regulated and investorprotected market dumped btc is highly correlated to said market crypto tokens are highly correlated to btc luna is crypto token luna dumped
347033,i want some non investment advise if i am in the camp that we will be in crypto winter soon and will get to buy sub 1k eth at some point but i cant get myself to sell because of the merge as the catalyst is merge a bad reason to keep holding
347034,its one of the most significant events in the history of ethereum
347035,but could equally be a nothingburger in terms of market reaction
347036,and the winter could be cold and deep
347037,this makes sense i hope they dont sell their other bags to double down on luna
347038,merge is a big event with eth
347039,validators says no
347040,but stop hearing about the shilling that eth will be up only when merge happens
347041,the big brains must find a way to counter sybil attacks
347042,as eth ever had anything similar to merge before probably nothing as significant but some major event people were waiting for
347043,londoneip1559 was a narrative catalyst
347044,whats the other 50
347045,got it ty
347046,hopium
347047,works great when the market is good
347050,
347051,just wanna say thank you for the early support the lobsters gave for icy in the early days means a lot and the team is thankful
347052,yellen says the stablecoin market is still too small to pose systemic risk link
347053,love her
347054,dont touch my stables

347058,43 of tether backing is in treasury bills which is about 31 b from usd nominated usdt us treasury issues about 1000 billion treasury bills each month so id agree with yellen
347059,even if the total stable coin market 167 billion would be 15x collaterised with treasury bills it wouldnt pose a risk let alone systemic risk yet
347060,ahem they can also just turn off the fiatcoins if theyre so inclined
347061,your size is not size
347062,
347063,make it possible to delete faulty txs from the queue blzzzz
347064,sad that they didnt implement this on every single tx build within gnosis safe
347065,its impossible but they should add the edit button
347066,this only works for the tx builder which is good but not good enough
347067,if someone from gnosis is hearing blz implement tyty
347068,but it also doesnt really make sense its not like you can just magically unsign a message that youve signed
347069,so if you didnt actually want to submit the tx and you delete it someone else can probably still use it if theyve saved your signature for the tx
347070,ser blz i cant watch them it looks meh
347071,fully agree yes of course
347072,nan
347073,will next update unleash the rekt or are parties prepared
347074,lmao chainlink is so scuff that they dont display their own data on datachainlink
347075,coinbase bondsooof
347077,anyone know whether terra btc bag has been sold yet
347078,as far as i know its in binance im assuming some of it has been sold but i dont know of an official source if someone has been tracking it
347079,
347080,chainlink messes up
347081,
347082,
347083,can someone get me up to speed on wtf tron is doing are they literally just doing the exact same thing do did 3 weeks ago
347084,
347085,hes making moves
347086,yes
347087,casual 200m transactions
347088,they cloned anchor but the btc backing is new to me
347089,huh it took less long than even my most pessimistic estimates for us to forgot everything and have learned nothing
347090,well to be fair it was announced a few weeks ago with 30 apyi havent been paying attention but im assuming there isnt deep liq for usdd if thats the right ticker
347091,hey everyone we just posted a massive update any support would be much appreciated feel free to check it out and play around with it
347092,is the algo stables model like at least a tiny bit different
347093,im not sure but i think its almost exactly the same id have to find the docs
347094,anchor szn
347095,its stupid will end the same and theres nothing algo to it just ponzu truth be told the best pegged algo stable is ampl whod have thought
347096,its an algorithmic stablecoin aka ponzi thats what all algos are
347097,how is frax a ponzi
347098,
347099,algorithmic doesnt mean ponzi but it is sketch
347100,if there was a stable bank run the stable wouldnt hold value
347101,its literally the exact same wtf
347102,mostly agreed i like fei better for that reason but frax is like 90 collateralized so at worst youre down 10 and its not some insane recursive scheme with an l1 token
347103,frax already lost its peg
347104,did the 2 addresses involved in the lunaust death spiral get doxxed yet
347105,where
347106,whats fei eth price of depeg
347107,blz dont turn pervert info into fud
347108,
347109,if u use cmc as a source for an oracle price arguments are gone
347110,fair enough
347111,its back now but it was off yesterday
347112,even usdt was off
347113,and other nonalgo
347114,again liquidity in a block solvency
347115,the peg is back now but it was off for a bit
347116,yeah even usdc or dai had cex depeges remember compoud oracle exploit
347117,still backing a stable with a mintable token of no other utility is simply ponzu
347118,frax never went below 0990 thats not a depeg in this environment
347119,ser that is yet again not a proof at least use the majority liquidity avenue for a given asset for stables that are not redemption based is usually curve
347121,luna has the same utility as eth
347122,
347123,nope
347124,so its not used to pay gas on terra
347125,seriously though can we get back to justin sun literally just doing ust again im torn up between buying trx for the first time ever because you know every degen out there has learned nothing or trying to find some long term short on it
347126,or not whats used for sybil in their dpos contraption
347127,i think this episode is going to make projects more conservative about what blockchain theyre on all the projects build on terra had nothing to do with this fiasco but are still struggling because of it and some other chains like fantom are still struggling to stay functional
347128,or perhaps some combination of my pet coin is older than yours has more bagholders than yours has nicer figureheads than yours has more issa store of valuedigitaloilists than yours makes the functionality different
347129,luna hasnt had anything built on it thats new or innovative ethereum has ethereum doesnt have a stablecoin with value attached to it that makes it go to 0 ethereum wont be forgotten about in five years
347130,irrelevant to the question of utility
347131,its not like the functionality of ethereum has fundamentally changed between now and the ico frenzy when it was churning out icos every other week
347132,
347133,there has been a variety of stable coins on eth which have gone to zero though
347134,legendary early defi days video tale by the degenscore chads
347135,such as
347136,esd mith etcim being a smart ass
347137,theyre not new or innovative therefore the functionality is different
347138,does eths utility get negatively rebased for every new pasta launched on it
347139,basis cash kwons experiment
347140,was discussing is today so true
347141,in the terra case burning the stable actually mints lunai think eth gets less flack bc its inflation isnt tied to any stable running on the network
347142,also a funnily ironic stance to take considering you came in here the other day talking about cloning curve
347143,so wait lunas only utility is that it is used to maintain the peg for ust
347144,perhaps but we cant exactly expect every new chain to just copypasta what ethereum is doing and call it a day
347145,this might help you
347146,
347147,no i get how the seigniorage mechanism works just always assumed luna had other inherent usage within terra but i guess its also the token that you stake so that makes more sense
347148,
347151,
347152,your input would help pls por favor mi familia
347153,sers could you explain how this stetheth unpeg will potentially affect on eth price fluctuations and more important why it can affect
347154,should reduce sell pressure as selling staked eth should be more painful and less attractive
347155,for now the new lido pool rekts weth depositors with a 5 haircut 16 bonus on withdrawal attempts
347156,why is that
347157,because the pool ratio is 131 in favour of steth withdrawing just weth creates a bigger imbalance and curve pools work like that
347158,oh okay i get it
347159,technically depositing weth in the background applies the ratio and splits your weth also into steth so on withdrawal into weth it does the opposite and this creates a spread im not a curve expert so this is my understanding in layman terms
347160,can someone tell me wtf happened here lol
347161,how did a luna 3x short lose 99 of its value
347162,after combination users total asset will not be affected at all if you put the order in the opposite direction there is a risk that the price will approach zero in extreme conditions this product subjects to the derivative with high risk please watch out the risk in investment
347163,leveraged tokens are usually affected by volatility and only track something like daily return
347164,you can replicate 3x short without liquidation risk and do it 11
347165,it explains it in the readme btw
347166,ankreth also at 093 rn
347168,so if i understand correctly this new lido pool will give 1m ldo which is nearly 13m so beyond 50m the yield would be arround 26 with depegging risk on lps
347169,so i think that this one is the most ignorant leader in crypto history
347170,
347171,its so outraging
347172,he wanted to impress the pretty girl thats all literally dckhead
347173,omfg this is just i dont have the words how scammy is he
347174,not sure if scammy but utterly blind by his wealth and power at that point
347175,if scammy he would know the apocalypse was coming
347176,he knew
347177,he launched other same shitcoin before and it spiralled
347178,lmao youre everywhere
347179,from the replies galois is spot on
347180,
347181,this twitter went to unknown to the most epic and well written thing in crypto right now the post of rome and carthage is something really flawless and with a classic flavour
347182,wait what they are paying employees 5bn
347183,5k employees
347184,damn they really do be giving each employee 1b a yr if they shared that globally it could be 100m each
347185,so it would mean 4m per employee per year
347186,how do i apply
347187,these wages are average im afraid
347188,
347189,the plan was here all along
347190,lol so yeah 199
347191,btw i forgot to ask
347192,how did this play out
347193,
347194,solid catch thank u
347195,he closed it a while back
347196,not sure if loss or win
347197,cant wrap my head around their icp position
347198,cost basis 0 maybe
347199,price for future vc rounds this summer
347200,how do web3 teams manage employee access to their shared wallets right now have terrible opsec where private keys for our low denomination hotwallet sit in password protected vault but then someone who has access but leaves team will always be able to retain access to that wallet via that system any elegant workarounds or services we would love to have various employees be able to sign on our behalf so a gnosis wouldnt work
347201,fireblocks
347203,
347204,yeah was hoping to not have to do a complex custodian arrangement like fireblocks or bitgo but maybe thats the only option
347205,qredo plus metamask institutional its the only viable option to have good multisig custody and access to web3
347206,what is doa
347209,interesting had not yet heard of it thank you
347210,would have to disagree on this onenear price is shite but the network is great usn is a nice alternative to a bank account and backed with usdt up to first 1b theres a fun ecosystem and the limited infra they have is good and well supported
347211,deed of agreement i supposemight be wrong idk
347216,wouldnt it be dead on arrival
347217,everyone knows that 95 of the companies in this space will die or at least anyone that has been in this space for more than a couple years it happens every bear market so hes not wrong there what he didnt know was that his would be one of them
347218,well minedude himself is giga rich so is probably everyone of the luna foundationthey wouldnt have baited with emergency plans etc for more exit liquidity if they wouldnt have made a full life money on this exit
347219,i am sure they are still rich but disagree they were baiting with exit liquidity they were trying to raise 15b to plug ust but the deal fell apart i doubt it would have stopped the bleeding though even if they managed to raise the funds
347220,i mean idk what else this would be he coulda worked on the deal silently without making people buy more luna
347221,thsi is straight baiting retail into more liquidity
347222,do kwon is an arrogant ass d
347223,close to announcing and disappears for 8 hours whats the fcking point
347224,terra has been stopped and restarded
347225,idk what these guys have been doingpatching but once thing i know is that trust has been broken
347226,it looks like hes buying time
347227,yeah exactly
347228,buying time to do what exactly
347229,also there is this rumor about terra korea branch
347230,i mean i used to do that to my tv back in the day ye olde kick it till it works technique
347231,hard to say but its a common pattern on ponzi operators
347232,i can find the block link but they were negotiating the fund raise at the time and in the crypto space silence makes people panic cant win either way say something and its baiting retail say nothing and people freak out and dump
347233,they were turning off staking to validators when they closed it to avoid governance attacks to due hyperinflation
347234,last example coming into my mind was sifu and daniele they delayed a lot answers and addressing the community concerns
347235,then did their airdrop announcement and pissed everyone when delivering it
347236,smells like the old good days of the weimar republik
347237,i mean wasnt foundation basically burning ust and dumping luna at that time
347238,says nothing y u no say anything to comluniteesays something y u bait retail
347239,haha fair comment tbh
347240,otherwise known as trying to repeg ust
347241,they officially have next to nothing left since monday
347242,my favorite message was from iron finance guys
347243,true
347244,sam will buy his bags later this year lmao
347245,no way retail will hold them all s
347246,they still have 2m avax
347247,i meant btc bags hehe
347248,omg this guy buying luna now is the same as flushing your money down the drain
347249,if i remember they are locked but dont quote me on that and a few milli wont help when you have a billi mcap to fix
347250,some shillers deserve jail
347251,why
347252,i meant it would be healthy for avax to abosrb a 2m avax market dump
347253,shillers doesnt deserve anything everyone is cool when your bags pumps due to shills but when dumps somehow its very bad
347254,kek
347255,unless they turn off ust burning
347256,also what do you think about that
347257,nobody is accountable for their decisions but peopleblame big funds backing them because many retails build their analysis based on reputable funds invested shit
347258,do kwon plan is exactly the opposite
347259,do shorted his coins to the ground
347260,do kwon has no plan his only plan is to go away with the money
347261,what an absolute idiot
347262,this tbh
347263,gcr probably started a private dao to short with size outside of his position
347264,i dont see it man if they turn off ust burning how do you restore peg ust circulating supply exceeds market cap by billions no one will fund that difference
347265,not gonna recover 100
347266,well big funds clearly telling people to borrow and go into anchor to then delete afterwards surely doesnt have a good taste either though
347267,gcr didint expect anything like what happened he closed at 26 bucks
347268,exactly why nobody talking about 3ac
347269,meh you know these guys
347270,they have an army of lawyers
347271,so what let them feel the fucking pain too
347272,that will find some smooth way to say that it was unintentional
347273,they deleted tweets
347274,the big fishes never get caught
347275,i mean there is a small chance they ll stop trying to restore the peg introduce new products new and more stable stable but with luna as a volatile token in the ecosystemin this case luna will appreciatetbh the only way to manage the whole mess from my view
347276,but why people blame influencers do they know if they got paid or also held a bag thats quite stupid to wish shillers die and shit like that vcs should die first because they knew exactly what design this shit had
347278,
347279,guys do kwon dissolved the korean entity a few days before crash that is what this paper says
347280,it means the dude doesnt want to be accountable for anything
347281,and probably knew what was going to happen
347282,you have to close a short before it goes too low if it goes to zero you get nothing
347283,shillers shill shit knowing its scammy pay them some money and they will shill anything thats why people hate them some vcs are the same though
347284,two steps ahead
347285,he learned from cz
347286,so the reports on lunaust being attacked were fake then what is real what is fake
347287,i wouldnt trust rumors emerging from 4chan
347288,how do you tell what is a rumor and what is real those documents could be forged too
347289,
347290,that is a good question but look dissolving a branch of a successful company does not make any sense except if by dissolving this branch you can avoid being charged and sentenced to jail for what is going to happen later now question what will you do
347291,its all fog of war at the moment the truth will come out eventually i guess needs some timeinvestigation
347292,this document can be forged indeed and obviously data forensics will be able to get things clear in the next few weeks i imagine so now it is all speculation indeed
347293,but that would explain things
347294,i think anything can happen in crypto lunatics still believe in do and the terra ecosystem so who knows they might be able to start over
347295,also i hate this guy he is arrogant and treated a lot of projects and people like shiti just believe he had his supporters in the finance that just cut him off at some point because it was not sustainable anymore i might be wrong but yeah that is my take
347296,just a glimpse of the ass he has been
347297,at least he wasnt a hypocrite i think that is even worse
347298,hahaha yeah
347299,anyone know if ondo token sale on coinlist sold out i saw they raised the max to 20k last minute but wasnt sure how the sale went
347300,
347301,this is insane
347302,ouch chainlink stop the feeds
347303,carpetpull by cl
347304,so many people rekt by catching knives or waiting in anchor due to this statement
347305,yea
347306,holy shit pretty irresponsible considering how many protocols use chainlink price feed
347307,we are just starting to learn the spillout and effects on wider market and different dapps many are probably quiet about it rn as they are trying to assess situation and also not cause more panic
347308,chainlink feed doesnt give a price for that specific chain so it could be an issue specific to bnb
347309,wdym
347310,they delisted it
347311,5 hours ago
347312,
347313,ah wait no they reinstated it 5 hours ago
347314,i saw that chainlink had a min price for luna at 001 probably they had to change it
347315,saw that too cant find the tweet now though
347316,
347317,lmao
347318,strong advice today from dragonfly capital to their portfolio companies1 if youre raising close the round asap2 cut the fat both in product and in personnel3 focus focus focus4 reset your evaluation dont rely on old assumptionsthere is one imperative in a market like this one survive
347319,my coin cant go below 01 we gucci
347321,lol love from chainlink
347322,this is a longer take on a similar idea but with a lot more depth to it great read imo so many different ways in which you can apply the mindset
347323,why would he bet with giganticrebirth and algo guy for 11 mils on the luna price though
347324,im pretty sure i saw the same email in my feed a few days ago sent by sequoia to their portfolio ceos at the start of the dotcom crash dragonfly got inspired it seems
347325,lmao do you really think he will keep his word dont be stupid bruh
347326,perp protocol has also suspended trading of luna they didnt really explain but i assume it was because it was impossible for lps to hedge their positions wether due to price feed or unavailability of alternative shorting venues idk
347327,i am ok to be stupid but he sent funds to escrow cobie bet was very public and widely discussed
347328,i bet he made much more then that on this operation
347329,but their stake is delegated to them right so if theyre slashed punishment for colluding lido operators lose less of their own money than nonlido validators with the same stake
347330,chainlink really dropped the ball there
347331,i wonder how theyre gonna explain that
347332,im with you the guy was willing to bet 250m that ust would not depeg
347333,chainlink protection
347334,135m
347335,nah it was planned to move to singapore
347336,heard it in early apr when i was there
347337,they were already there for months
347338,have yall seen the drama going down with instadapp lite vault the stetheth depeg caused some code in the contract to malfunction and now vault depositors are screwed and the team is kinda silent about it so far
347339,it is not a question of if it was planned to move to singapore or not
347340,this all reminds me of perlin extreme hubris rekt everyone and crashed the market
347341,he didnt match gcr bet he knew it algo bet was matched and imo used as marketing at that time gcr bet was much bigger and it was probably his own money so he didnt match it
347342,makes sense thnx for opinion
347343,only drama i noticed was that a continued depeg would liquidate their steth vault indeed the one behind lite however they have since added 22m in usdc to their collateral and their healthratio is quite safe for the type of leverage they have what do you mean with something in the contract went wrong where did you read about it
347344,he did
347345,gcr bet 10 million not sure why hes saying 20 million now
347346,
347347,weird
347348,he shorted with another 10 mil on cex after luna under 90
347349,3days ago
347350,absolute chad
347351,luna couple of ticks from 0
347352,they need to add decimals
347353,or trade 1k luna per block
347354,1b luna blocks
347355,its fine just go negative
347356,didnt ftx have like a 1m doge or something like that pair
347357,where is the most swap liquidity on harmony
347358,people still dep to dump
347359,funny to see a billion luna sell wall when just two days ago total supply was 330m
347360,they printing like 100 bill an hr atm
347361,
347362,anyone else remember gmo veggie yam that shortcircuited when the supply got too large
347363,still dont understand why he sacrifice maintoken of an ecosystem for a stable coin
347364,notice of removal of trading pairs and updates on tick size for spot trading pair 20220513
347365,luna spot getting delisted
347366,yeh that is the final move
347367,8ish minutes till the gates close
347368,at this rate luna gonna get more decimals than btcs sats
347369,confused luna is still avail through lunabusd and lunaust
347370,yeah
347371,and added like 3 zeros to the ticks
347372,wow binance really just want to squeeze every penny out of their customers
347374,correction slightly less large gate keep the fees coming
347375,gates have been closed for like 2 days already
347376,the only thing you can do with your luna on binance is trade it withdrawals deposits are suspended
347377,what happens to a chainlink oracle if the price is too lowhas too many decimals
347378,should get them through the day
347379,not delisted just changed pair
347380,to busd
347381,it will trade until no more buy orders i think
347382,and this is death
347383,nan
347384,removal of margin will lead to spot volume death prob
347385,first time seeing 100 displayed amazing
347386,has to be only bots buying at this point
347387,nah i see hundreds of people on twitter boasting about how low of a price they have bought in lol
347388,hello darkness my old friend
347389,imagine your daughter named after your project
347390,talk about hubris
347391,fun fact after 100 can still another 100
347392,so when does binance stop adding zeros
347393,well its getting close to 000000
347394,nan
347395,you can watch it its really like something dying
347396,i really liked harry potter thats why
347397,some kind of gradative death
347398,00000200 atm
347399,so binance probably added like 3 more hours of trading to it
347400,_ and i wanted to sleep
347401,gg thanks for playing
347402,when the fees stop coming but the fees are technically worthless
347403,for the first time i witness the shrink in trading pair like this
347404,the price keep tanking into oblivion
347405,me neither but they were bound in so many ways i guess
347406,tradingview doesnt have more decimals
347407,they must be getting fee and dump immediately back to busd
347408,404
347409,works for me
347410,this is one of the worst things to happen to any business in recorded history outside of physical harm i dont think the world has ever witnessed such a significant loss of funds evaporating in such a small time frame
347411,both in the total value lost and number of people affected
347412,yikes
347413,carpetpull
347414,1 trillion supply is coming
347415,on avalanche
347416,chainlink one of those central points of failure
347417,40b in a couple days
347418,thats peanuts
347419,like facebook stock alone lost over 100b in feb
347420,not like it was ever real money to begin with just leverage created vapor
347421,
347422,
347423,defi protocols have accounted for an evergrowing share of all funds stolen from cryptocurrency platforms since the beginning of 2020 and lost the vast majority of stolen funds in 2021 as of may 1 defi protocols account for 97 of the 168 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2022 link
347424,ops
347425,yeah i got cleaned out for like 25 avax on there i retaliated by borrowing all the luna they had and selling it for 02 avax on trader joe
347426,new use case by defi
347427,the de is missing
347428,tried to short luna got autodeleveraged and limited by position size so i bought luna3s token on mexc luna is down another 99 since then but the price of the 3s token is about the same can anyone explain this strange phenomenon
347429,maybe its a synthetic token meant to be held very very short term volatility decay and not a leveraged short see
347430,totaled already
347431,
347432,even very very short term on the order of an hour luna went from like 00001 to 000001 and the 3s token is the same price
347433,its as if the token doesnt actually track anything at all and just trades sideways very strange
347434,
347435,its now at a 2 trillion circulating supply
347436,bullish
347437,lure the retail would be nice if we stopped putting retail on a pedestal like its comprised of children who cant think for themselves
347438,the same retail barely a week ago would tell you with the strongest of convictions that you were wrong if you said anything bad about luna and friends
347439,4t2631 is the limit
347440,source mfer
347441,
347442,interesting
347443,any other defi platforms that are dependent on chainlink oracle
347444,that where using luna as collat
347445,
347448,omg i have been creating my own stablecoins by going longshort 5050 on an asset arthurs idea is similarso instead of backing a stablecoin with pure bitcoin volatile with undercollateralization risk when price drops you back the stablecoin with synthetic dollars created by going longshort 5050 on bitcoin so each stablecoin can be redeemed for 1 of bitcoin which is now stable because each btc is paired with an equal value of short derivative contracts that go in the opposite direction pricewise
347449,someone build this asap
347450,who pays funding rate
347451,nevermind you get what you pay not sure this is that simple lol
347452,i think he covered how it would be sustainable and how fees would be collected
347453,please build this
347454,you right let me finish the article i had it opened earlier and only got 30 through it
347455,lol stablecoin tied to a volatile asset what can go wrong
347456,or at least lets discussbrainstorm this in here
347457,you have to account slippage as well
347458,thats effectively a fiatcoin with more steps if its to grow to any relevant size
347459,now we must introduce some centralisation which brings in a whole other set of issues to this design the only places where these inverse contracts trade in sufficient size to accommodate a bitcoinbacked stablecoin that can service the current ecosystem occur on centralised exchanges cexs
347460,meh
347461,he suggested that the stablecoin should be an erc20 so we need to use wrapped bitcoins like how do you redeem the bitcoins from erc20 stablecoins
347462,check out uxd protocol on solana
347463,you go to these guys and ask for your money back and hopefully dont get nope
347464,this is an interesting take for a crypto stable coin that is not based on fiat
347465,oh sheit this is the first time i check their website
347466,well given the huge demand for stablecoins why wouldnt it be feasible to decentralize the short derivative contracts business for supporting stablecoins doesnt dydx offer thisor just start small and grow from there
347467,its not like the demand isnt huge enough
347468,lol this gota be a joke right
347470,not at all
347471,dydx is centralized
347472,they claim they will be decentralized by eoy but whether that actually happens is up for debate
347473,oh maybe i was thinking of another platform
347474,as for starting small sure but like hayes says small is what itll remain unless it has access to cexs
347475,yes there is slippage but its not like 100 of people will redeem at the same time and the last 10 cant get theirs coz of slippage the collateral will be stable when coupled with derivatives so you wont have terra part ii you can also overcollateralize it
347476,luna pretty good bet here
347477,end supply is 6t mcap 100m lfg have over a billion still and luna holders likely get some of that
347478,i think it is such an interesting asymmetric bet with huge upside
347479,yeah i put in like 100
347480,thats how fortunes are made still a gamble of course
347481,you can use the covid dump as an example for a scenario
347482,you are a smart fella
347483,price was jumping between 3 and 4k on an empty orderbook would you be able to ensure the stablecoin will be actually stable
347484,i was thinking the same might throw in some lunch money on luna too
347485,chain is halted
347486,speculation isnt
347488,delisting everywhere soon i guess
347489,i think most major ones have already delisted most pairs
347490,but there is still wormhole degens gotta degen
347491,for any protocol that has the same exposure share
347493,reminds me of bitconnect people speculated on it until it was delisted from every last exchange
347494,lol
347495,legally can these people who abused the bug be prosecuted
347496,
347497,good project but they had such a horrible gov token sale i think they had one of the worst tokenomics ever alameda backed
347498,interesting spin by the chainlinkers though
347499,i believe project using luna collateral should have been proactive on this if they cant even take obvious decision like this or maybe they didnt get the information that chainlink paused the oracle
347500,no maybes there was no mention of a pause
347501,theyre all linking to some random tweet in chinese that doesnt even tag anyone
347502,if thats the case thats a terrible signal sent from chainlink
347503,seems mostly a chainlink oversight than anyone elses fault
347504,whole defi is built on oracle and many use chainlink and they can decide to pause it like that
347505,yeah its pretty strange borrowers probably didnt even know what was going on lol
347506,vaguely similar to the raiblocks exchange exploit from 2017
347508,chainlink fucked these guys for sure should have communicated better
347509,i forgot about raiblocks damn meteoric rise and meteoric fall too
347510,2 rebrands lol
347513,still missing a word try again
347515,where do you guys think the market is going
347516,haha
347517,bear mkt till q2 2023
347518,how are you doing the mathits 570m total expense on tech and developmentfor 5000 people thats about 100k per person per quartercaveats1 not all expense goes into salary 2 tech teams might be less than 5000
347519,the based ghouls avatar are clearly the most based avatar
347520,why q2 not q4 any reason
347521,q6
347522,what app or website do you use to follow portfolio value something on desktop since i am a boomer i used to use delta but now they completely removed the desktop support and data are not synching
347523,haha
347525,rotki does this
347526,
347527,still folks coming to this space luckily
347528,thanks will give it a try
347529,anyone have any insights on stethcollateral ribbon covered call specifically regarding the steth depeg
347531,do you think all the chainlink nodes are fetching there steth price from the same source curve pool
347532,can they even do anything regarding ust now that everything is delisted
347535,zapper zerion debank
347536,hey guys is there any good token allocation research i can learn about tokenomics design
347537,bankless has recently published one any more
347538,redeem through ren
347539,
347540,every single ones uses chainlink
347541,
347542,uxd and lemma finance
347543,chainlink prob still largest single point of failure
347544,not the ones on solana but this has placed a major red flag on chainlink for mehow could they delist randomly zz
347545,the problem with this strategy is that were assuming the funding rates to be always positive which is not the case
347546,tread carefully as chainlink community dont deal well with constructive criticism cant understand why this would trip a circuit breaker when multiple independent sources would be reporting the same and what benefit said circuit breaker introduces when its pushing stale or inaccurate data id understand if there were relatively few sources and therefore a circuit breaker trips because of outliers but this doesnt make too much sense
347547,for me ser there is no other choice if you want to launch a protocol yes this one with minimum price is a weird thing idk reasoning for it but all their other stuff works very well amantay_a did some price deviations comparison maybe he can share his cool research
347548,im seeing a lot of discussion around past present and furure of stablecoins in particular decentralized onesis there any tg or discord group out there discussing this precise topic i would be very interested to get involved not looking for a protocol more the theorethical discussion around stablecoins
347552,
347553,chainlink price feeds are just price oracles sourcing data from multiple venues i reckon every defi protocol on ethevms uses link oracles
347554,uxd has kind of a fund that accumulates during negative funding rate and uses that to pay when funding rates are positive
347555,its because the circuit breaker was literally just a price below 010 which is by design on chainlink anyone implementing chainlink code should know this but yeah its a detail thats easy to gloss over i guessthe alternative is having no breaker and letting people get bad or incorrect data when something goes down 999 in a short time period i can see the motivation behind having the breaker protocols implementing chainlink should check if the price is at the breaker price and halt trading or freeze because the assumption is that something has gone horribly wrong and simply not having the breaker would lead to equally bad outcomes probably
347556,there is sooo much to ctrlf here on this back from the yam days even if you go look for it and make an actual report we can even have the dao sponsor that research and gib a grant potentially
347557,the problem is that in a lengthy bear market where funding rates are negative and remain negative the lemma in my understanding assumes that funding rates are favourably skewed in the long term
347558,wow ok this is quite motivetional might do it but still if there was an already existing research group protocol and chainindependent id simply join it
347559,why is yield in the yearn stethreth almost 0 now woulda thought theres a lot of action there now
347560,they switched to a new pool
347561,double checking here after a dm is lebed2045 legit
347562,the convos were chain independent and they covered yam esd dsd basis cash etc whatever new chat you find you wont you would have to ctrlf anyway cause nobody wanna go explain the same design for the 10th time
347563,fireblocks is best as it allows you access to web3 but also you can enforce policy rules so prevents the exact situation described after someone leaves
347564,legit you asked about stablecoins discussion i send you group address like lol wft i dmd you specificalyl to avoid flooding in the main lobster group tldr thats all you need to know about stablecoins right now
347565,with respect everyone is conditioned to be wary of anyone dming firstunexpectedly so i dont think thats necessarily a unexpected reaction and i dont think any disrespect was meant ofc i didnt see the actual message you sent
347566,no group is better than lobster all big brains are here buying low to see what would happen with usdn that works by the same model as ust did but had no real adoption hence all redemption oversupply could be capped
347567,btw does anyone has stats on who are winners from the luna game 11279958651 ust supply with close to no backing is no joke so during the printing period people who entered the game payed something for it 20 apr wasnt for the whole sum for long time so even excluding purely outofair printed part there should be billions of dollars assets that were sold to get this ust where they are
347568,do you mind sending me that group address
347569,much of that was borrowed as well mine were i deposited 2000 luna in may at a price of around 5 i borrowed 3500 ust at a rate of 280 annually thats almost 10k subsidy on a loan for me
347570,good point my assumption that the larger part of luna was aquired by far lower than ath prices and these people maxed our their loans by swaping it for collaterisedfiat stablecoins they are winners so theres no publicallt avaliable dashboard for such data
347571,luna ust trading suspended
347572,aaaaaand
347573,
347574,the end
347575,hmm
347576,whyd they drag it out adding loads of extra decimals to trading pair only to delist when it recovers
347577,so 65 trillion newly printed luna wasnt the end already observing it realtime the last few days was a onefor a lifetime event
347578,170b
347579,
347580,trading fees ofc
347581,yeah true idk what point i was trying make still they will have caused sooo many people to get rekt
347582,pretty crappy
347583,yeah but what is true actually
347584,if they had stopped sooner surely people would be more rekt as they wouldnt be able to cut any losses
347585,well no one could really cut losses much anyway
347586,all they did is get waaay more people to buy in
347587,the end 2 lol
347588,i think if they delisted it too soon people would have started to blame binance for interfering with the peg restoration which is nonsense but you know how it goes
347589,200m traded on busd pair after the network was finally shut down
347591,shutdown or just being restarted
347592,oh officially shutdown
347597,uxd
347599,gm sers could anyone showsent me links to recent pitch deck showcases especially recent protocols on different l1sappreciate it
347600,whatre good dextools competitors now for seeing lists of all tokens prices etc
347601,chartex dexguru
347602,dunno if ivan will block me for dragging this on but personally i find it disgusting how vcs that have been shilling a known scam are now not even able to say the simple english word sorry for having shilled a scam to young desperate and uninformed peoplesorry for spamming but imo we as a community must get better at speaking up and defi protocols must get better at not just incorporating every junk token and then finger pointing at chainlink
347604,well he kinda says sorry 3ac didnt build their money and reputation by giving guidance and being fair and supportive they shill you into aths while shorting and dumping on you the same moment always has been that way i think the difference people make isproject gets 3ac investing means good pump does the project actually profit from that besides marketingpump probably not but that doesnt matter mostlymost projects prefer big names and pamp value provided and it showsso imo the distinction and actually real results would come from projects changing their investors not from people hating on zhu3ac because that doesnt change anything
347605,100 agree terraanchor has been heavily promoted to new comers many of my newbie friends got burnt on this and wont come back to crypto any time soon if not ever by hurting them they hurt us and the whole ecosystem cant keep relaying these guys a little cancel culture can do good too
347606,i took all of my money out of ust just 6 days before it started to depeg the warning signs were there i give credit to algodtrading a few youtubers like coininsider made a video called undeniable proof that luna ust ponzi i remember watching that and slowly seeing anchor protocol asset going down thats when i took the decision to remove all my money out
347607,people need to do research now we will have politician coming in to protect us well done vcs and do kwon for pimping this scam into retail
347608,could have been much much more attacker nice
347609,
347611,yeh but what can you do
347612,ok i stand corrected zhus last tweet came 10min later but he does say im sorry smol thing but restores respect in zhu as a person not as an investor tho
347613,kek
347615,well there are 2 ways of seeing things 1 you are over 18 and you are the only responsible of your action if you lose money its your own fault 2the other way to see it is few people have knowledge and majority are too dumb to understand what they do so they follow people eg su and we need to protect them by whatsoeveri want to advocate for the 1 personally people should be responsible and free
347616,general population want to be lead
347617,they need a prophet whos role is to be sacrificed when things go wrong
347618,this wont change
347619,i think 2 is an open door to all regulations
347620,1 isnt scalable
347621,im all libertarian but i also dealt with people crying who lost their jobs and all clue what theyre supposed to do now and i was too rekt myself to offer them a jobim also against cancelling people but the investors influencers who shilled young desperate kids who got failed by boomer economy with their little savings into ust should be shamed out of this space not pretty but imo thats on us now
347622,oh its all about community ngl zu shu is smart
347623,dont you think its completely reckless to all in a a protocol such as anchor or in a token such as luna the problem is way ahead
347624,and then again if you think people are too young to take this kind of decision the natural outcome will be to deliver some license to be able to invest
347625,ah u arguing ethics everyone chooses for themselves personally i believe to better be open and explain downsides dont caveat but even if you know downsides you can still bet green and if you bet red cause there is downside you can still be wrong many parties in this bet knew downsides they accepted them it was not moronic per seanyway regulation is surely not a good idea is always scam just being responsible for your own stuff is the way and choose your friends wisely
347626,done convo this is circular sorry
347628,interesting pov have seen many critics point out that the real failure besides the ponziesque tokenomics was the lack of leadership of the team
347629,we ordered them to fix everything and they could not fix the peg and the coin and the mint like bro u read the design
347630,as it was working as intended just meant luna going to 000000000000000000000000001
347631,my luna at binance is gone 12 bucks lost
347632,not bs job to know all designs though i am mostly shitposting just funny he does not know biggest ponzi design or maybe just misphrased
347633,dk about that tbh depends on when exactly that request by binance was made bc sure the design is flawed but point is that they have waited way too long anyway they could have salvaged some of the network by halting it early in the downwind and reworking the system design i remember some interesting proposition that had been made early tuesday
347634,yup i noted was mostly surprised
347635,this is probably a badly phrased summary there were a few courses of action that the terra team could have taken regardless of the design flaws in hindsight it probably would have been the right move to completely freeze the luna mint mechanism when it became apparent that the peg could not be saved then they should have announced that they will determine bad debt and work on raising funds put the whole thing into runoffjust letting the protocol run its course might be the most defi thing but it certainly was not the most sensible move in terms of mitigating damageedit somewhat like this
347636,yup yup you guys are right
347637,agreed plus note that maybe the most important part of the tweet is that they did not even bother to give a response at all sure they were in warroom modus but ghosting binance is probably not the best course of action
347638,probably its hard to asnwer questions when you dont have a detailed plan on how to save the project
347639,lets be fair when luna is below 1 cent from 140 and then you delist after firstly still listing busd perpsthis aint protection either
347640,celsius pulled half a billion dollars out of anchor protocol amid terra chaos link
347641,it is not binances job to protect people from making dumb decisions the reason they ultimately acted was because the playingfield eg deposits being not possible while minting continued was not level anymore apart from a few details i can follow their reasoning and timing with regards to ustluna perps and spot pairs
347642,while the block research was unable to determine whether the remaining funds were withdrawn a person with direct knowledge of the situation said that there are no celsius funds left outstanding with anchor protocol implying that the remaining 36000 eth or 74 million was also withdrawn or the remaining is worth 0 idk
347643,has anyone figured out in cointracker how to make eth and weth the same thing
347644,says they borrowed the ust with beth as collateral theyre okay provided they bridged all their beth collateral before the network shutdown
347645,ye i dont think its their job either also i think it ultimately was a good decisionjust the reasoning is unneeded
347646,nan
347647,what does premine address mean in this context
347648,deleted
347649,premined btc oo
347651,sooo thats the reason for the steth depeg then theyre unwinding
347652,deleted new tweet without premined
347653,thats probably why they deleted the tweet premined btc makes no sense lol
347654,hi all im having issues withdrawingswapping on the terra network since yesterday im using the web extension with a ledger nano x and get the following error anyone encountered this and knowing of a fix
347655,chain is halted
347656,im sorry for you
347657,didnt they restart it yesterday
347658,halted again
347659,ah was not aware of this thanks for the fast reply guys much appreciated
347660,he was asking for a fix though
347661,theres no fix if the chain aint working
347662,terra will restart soon
347663,yep thats clear
347664,so people can withdraw their assets
347665,the swap module however will not work
347666,but the people who has beth for example on terra should be able to withdraw
347667,we are waiting for a majority should be up soon
347668,im hearing that yes but with limited functionality perhaps just a way to remove collateral from anchor
347669,exactly
347670,good
347671,there is no clear path yet except this
347672,theres a the swap module on terra just one
347673,meaning you won t be able to swap any assets
347674,only withdraw
347675,this is mainly for wormholelido assets
347676,dont swaps happen on some dex how can they turn those off
347677,its a virtual amm designed to handle minting and burning of luna terra stables not a dex per se
347678,what are you guys doing ur taxs on these days im using cointracker and it kinda sucks
347679,koinly
347680,koinly
347681,ah just those swaps so cw20 swaps should work on terraswpastroport
347682,clawmvp is probably much more up to speed with the effort at this point
347683,yeah
347684,can u import the work that u did from cointracker thocan u set eth and weth to be the same thing
347685,i don t know actually about those but you will be able to check it pretty soon
347686,lobsters hello again everyone can someone show or sent links to the recent pitchdesk showcases especially interested in the latest protocols on l1 including defi
347687,can u set eth and weth to be the same thing why they are not the same thing for tax purposes wrapping is a disposal
347688,you sure wasnt the whole purpose of wbtc for you to wrap your btc and take a loan against it without it being a tax event
347689,terra up
347690,are you trying to hire a researcher because there are jobs boards for that if you are interested
347691,samkazemian almost got 100s of millions of of his community lps rekt via the 4pool he was simply lucky his good rep amongst ogs is one more bad sign of the state of this space
347692,would have also been frax deepest liquidity pool then up to the people to decide if that pool going to zero would really not have been a threat to the protocol
347693,pretty sure
347694,usdt depegged i think that is the reason
347695,nope just curious how different projects explain their fundraising goals and tokenomics in early pitch decks
347696,im talking about their upcoming now not happening obviously 4pool
347697,cointelegraphcomnewshowtoprotectyourselffromtherecentspateofcryptomuggings
347698,i actually already explained this in our own telegram that the 4pool was never intended to be used dramatically as collateral for frax so in terms of the peg it would be like worrying about usdcs peg because its in the 4pool namely it would be irrelevant it seems like youre more concerned about the lps of the pool than the actual protocols pegsolvency which is a totally separate matter people should see if the yield is worth the risk to them and make an informed decision we launch integrations with projects all the time as long as that doesnt directly jeapordize the peg of frax i dont see a reason to complain with that said obviously i didnt expect this situation and its beyond disheartening to see how much people have lost in the terra ecosystem its a terrible situation all around over there frax though as a protocol and stablecoin is doing just fine
347699,theres a lot of locked concentrated liquidity on uni v3 and also a vast majority of that curve pool is owned by the protocol through the amo itself it should rebalance shortly anyway to make the weights closer to 5050 but even at that weight the peg is basically exactly at parity like i said before we dont do anything reckless and the protocol firmly owns a vast majority of stableswap lp collateral and other liquidity to keep the peg
347700,i believe in frax as long as sam does not say other ppls size is not size
347701,haha never i know theres always bigger fish in the sea somewhere we just want to build cool features and amos for frax not really interested in causing twitter drama
347702,anyone building uxd on eth
347703,or an l2
347704,you really didnt expect this situation as in you didnt realize that ustluna would one day go to zero or as in you wouldnt expect it to happen so short term
347705,no i mean i was hopeful that they would be able to adopt the frax model quickly enough to get to a high collateral backing the same way our peg has been so robust but unfortunately they werent able to in time i think the fact is everyone knows stablecoins need collateral by now no one is under the impression that you can have vanilla algo stable design and make it
347706,how much of this 155b frax in the curve pool is owned by the protocol
347707,just over 23rds you can see the real time stats on the amo page appfraxfinanceamos
347708,please share dummy guide about how frax worksand why its more stable than usti mean after reading wp or official materials i understand only frax backed by some of usdc collateral ratio rest is in frax shareswhat if frax shares going to 0 as luna is there any liquidations hedge
347709,23 of the pool or 23 of the frax in the pool
347710,i guess 23 of the pool
347711,23rds of the total supply of the lp tokens so it can pull out and burn frax up to more than the supply of frax that can be sold into the entire pool itself right now
347712,anyway would be nice that if you talk simulations in a post that you would include the worst case scenario which in this case would be to dump 15b frax into a 2b pool instead of the 1b frax into a 3b pool that you described
347713,it has a lot of collateral and a lot of locked liquidity the locked liquiditypol means that even if fxs were to go down in price a lot there is more liquidity owned by the protocol and also locked than there is supply out in the market thats what we try to explicitely aim for always when designing the algo supply its mostly backed though tbh the algo supply is v small hope thats simple enough
347714,can you explain what you mean not sure i follow right now theres only 17b frax in existence 900m of it is in the curve pool itself theres tons of locked liquidity on uni v3 and other places as well the protocol owns 66 of the entire curve pool so most of that 900m frax isnt even circulating
347715,dont have any issues with how the frax protocol works by the way so that was off topic and not importantrelevant nitpicking since were used too far less transparent comms in cryptojust feel that the level of endorsement from you of the lunaust was highly opportunistic and crossed the red line away from integrityresponsibility particularly as someone who is regarded an expert in that matter
347716,and thus has to be aware that many people will follow him blindly
347717,
347718,is there a full history thread
347719,im sorry for that like i said i was optimistic about them adopting the fractional collateralized model that frax runs on which has worked historically like i said before we work with a lot of projects that want to integrate with us we make sure those integrations do not existentially endanger the peg in any case i hear you and overall im also saddened by whats happened
347720,aussie tax be scary
347721,well your post says 25b frax in existence 155 in the curve pool 1b sell order possible into 3b pool 155 frax 155 3crvthe protocol owns 23 of the 15b frax in the curve pool so in a worst case scenario fudpanic 5b frax and 5b 3crv can be withdrawn from the pool you now have a 2b pool and a 1b5b15b sell order
347722,
347723,if thats your worst case for fraxs design you guys need to be more imaginative
347724,yes but another thing you arent counting is in the event that the nonpol liquidity is withdrawn and sold like that the amo would consistently burn the frax to keep the balance of the pool within stableswap peg range for an a factor of 1500 any remaining amount of frax left to be sold after that is a minority left compared to the other collateral the protocol has left hundreds of millions of locked liquidity on uni v3 etc
347725,enlighten us
347726,btw im going to head out for a bit but if you want to discuss the simulationsgame theory feel free to dm me and ill respond shortly
347729,sure but you were using a super simplified example and it wouldnt have hurt to take the worst case of this super simplified scenario anyway this is just nitpicking nothing wrong with your post
347730,what did he do to owe so much money
347731,probably made big profits and forgot to put some aside for tax
347732,he seems to be broke now
347733,yep big tax obligation one year then probably lost it all and cant pay
347734,live in australia
347735,theres constant storytelling about how itll eventually get rid of its fiatcoin and friends collateral but is that ever actually gonna happen or is it kicking the can down the road to pacify bagholders and anyone that may say anything about it
347736,i thought it was a nice country
347737,is such a model even viable in the first place makerdao was all gungho about being decentralized and all it took was black thursday to toss aside the veneer of decentralization and all in into all sorts of weirdness that now comprise over 40 of its backing
347738,you mean there is an issue with the properties of the collateral used might be but thats not a specific property of the protocol design as its interchangeable in principle however i agree that in practical terms theres nothing to replace it with
347739,interchangeable to what
347742,well thats the problem i think we all agree that there needs to be collateral but what would be good collateral if you bar the fiat backed stablecoins
347743,but tax is constant reminder that i need to move
347744,if it was interchangeable in principle they wouldve started out that way theres a difference between being 11 collateralized by a fiatcoin and 11 collateralized by eth theres also the funny fine print of them coming to own progressively less of the liquidity if it goes too far
347745,he gambled away like 150mln as per his own posts but might be just tax evasion tactics dunno
347746,as for needing collateral i disagree but for something that markets itself so aggressively like some sort of algorithmic design breakthrough its little more than a handglove for your favorite selection of fiatcoins and their freezable brethren
347747,tbh almost every country where you profited 150 mill and then lost it a year later you will be rekt
347750,deleted what did it say
347751,was claiming celsius might be insolvent too
347753,how do the bridges work i mean how does the smart contract on ethereum holding the eth bridged to terra know whether the submitted bridge transactions terra eth were valid transactions on terra
347754,would it detect if terra was 51 attacked and those malicious validators submitted invalid steal wrapped eth to bridge back to eth transactions in terra
347755,arjunbhuptanipardon for the ping
347756,the terraeth bridge is built by wormhole i believe
347757,curious could they actually do the first 2 even if they wanted to wouldnt it go through a similar process as compound with their minting bug same for 3 also are the terra and anchor team the same
347758,and they dont currently check chain conditions when bridging optimistic bridges check for this and have safety measures to protect against it but others currently do not
347759,so yes theoretically an invalid update produced on terra could be used to unlock funds on ethereum that shouldnt be unlocked
347760,
347761,im not 100 certain on the conditions it would take to produce that invalid update though
347762,cool thats what im looking for
347763,technically you can do this but it would hardfork the chain the main issue then becomes how wormhole would handle the hardfork in theory wormhole and other nonoptimistic bridges tend to treat onchain data as the source of truth so they would just trust whatever came from the chain and it would just come down to what version of the truth the specific nodes they are connected to would report
347764,and if not pretty sure putting up a governance vote about locking people in would cause a recordtime race to the exit
347765,thanks a lot ser
347766,luna ust trading resumed
347767,wait what
347768,where is the logic
347769,this is such a clusterfuck
347770,more trading fees for cz
347771,they wanted to make an example others would follow after that they have probably seen that others dgf about binance delisting and binance is coming back for those trading fees and liquidationslook at ftx instant 40 growth on ust money is there to be made even if its dirty money
347772,remove pair make it dump to 0 buy some open pair make profits
347773,blood for the blood god
347774,now its safe
347775,in the money for cz
347776,wake me up in 100 years binance will be the same
347777,any business will be same tho
347778,is the terra chain even back online or are we trading ghost internet money now
347779,
347780,lmao the quote as well
347781,savage dead rekt
347782,what a beast
347783,protecting users by letting them sell
347784,its online still rugged tho
347785,kwon is literally in hiding
347786,what did kwon expect i honestly dont understand his thought process here
347787,make a lot of cash enjoy his moment in the sun go into hiding for rest of his life do a nikola
347788,to turn maker style soon enough
347789,soft rug via depeg
347790,basis cash style exit shoulda tell you that he is used to just getting away
347791,didnt feel very soft
347792,hi does anyone know where i can find info about fpifpis fpi treasury address fpi treasury strategies fpi treasury performance info about fpi mintingredemption etc dont see it in official docs dune no answer in frax tg group
347793,indirectbetter
347794,
347795,for 1 hr period trades reversed affected users get 10 in cro lol
347796,almost as good as their cashback update lol
347797,anyone know what the deal is now with lunaust redemptions
347798,i see luna is still being redeemed but nowhere near as much now
347799,looks like luna printing is still paused
347800,you cant deposit them anyway
347801,i thought they disabled swaps
347802,does anyone know why euro is losing so hard against the dollar
347803,ukraine war and some other macro issues ecb still needs to follow fed rate hikes also i think
347804,can ust still be exchanged for 1 luna
347805,us making a lot of benefit from war
347806,actually just interest rates can do the trick since everyone is moving to dollar in order to generate yield and it becomes more and more expensive in terms of euro
347807,
347808,re euralso keep in mind the majority of the debt in the world is usd denominatedas the rates increasing and will keep doing so for some timethose in debt need to accumulate usddemand is there and will only increasewhich is reflected in usd exchange rate now
347809,guess that answers the question
347810,anybody thinks binance pair resume is fishy
347811,cz needs fees
347812,i mean cz just posted a link to protect users
347813,probably lfg rebuying luna at 0
347814,is this a proposal to now become a ohm fork
347815,well its not
347816,supply still going up just much slower
347817,whats the rate now
347818,could you please share where can i track it live
347819,
347820,ust supply
347821,it is lol
347822,what happens if the variable overflows
347823,hey guys how to swap bep20 bsc to cro any crosschain dapps
347824,multichain
347825,
347826,need to swap luna bep20 lol
347827,total supply unlimited
347828,how do i see when the next fed rate announcement is is there a calendar or dates somewhere
347829,
347830,people dumping steth eth cash out
347831,thank you so does this mean next fed rate announcement is in june 1415
347832,its people who are leverage with steth
347833,yes it does the actual announcement is 15th
347834,do we expect another rate hike in june how do we estimate whether theyre going to raise or not
347835,also probably people who doesnt want take additional risk on derivatives so much fear in the market rn ser
347836,
347837,aeth is much cheaper compared to steth
347838,i think this might be wrong channel for the macro speculation but my 2 cents fed clearly indicated that they want to kill demand and fight the inflation last inflation print was 83 which is still way too high feds powell said yesterday that market needs to feel more pain and equities are still over priced it means that rate hikes are coming there are many estimates on future hikes i suspect that they do 50bps next time when sp500 has tanked 3040 and unemployment is on rise theyll stop
347839,is there a lobster macro speculation channel i agree with you btw but it will be interesting to see what the ecb will do italy and spain cant stomach high rates like the us can i suspect we might see usd eur at parity soon
347840,
347841,also ankreth at 8 discount
347842,nan
347843,nan
347844,stuart claims usdx will return to the peg because it is not an algorithmic token like ustusdx is not ust once ust is out of the system usdx is anticipated to go back to its pegstuart addedback to peg how theyll cover the value lost in ust
347845,if u buy an nft their is
347846,
347847,dont see any way around that
347848,because all countries are derisking their shitcoin local currencies to pay off debts
347849,all debts are paid in usd stable coin hence all other assets eat shit
347850,fxs from frax has a constant supply right
347851,lol
347852,
347853,what does 50bps mean
347854,05
347855,no basis points not 05 but 05 percentage points a rise of a 3 rate by 50bps means the new rate is 35
347856,i fail to see the difference
347857,1bps001
347858,is 50bps a big raise or average
347860,a rise of a 3 rate by 05 means the new rate is 3015 the difference is in math terms percent vs percentage points former are relative to the base value latter are absolute i dont know how to explain it sensibly
347861,
347862,50bps in current economy is the expected rise 25bps is bullish 75bps is bearish
347863,i understood abzv11 correctly then all good
347864,yea its 05 not 1005
347865,starting your tweets with this is is based
347866,imo the impact on interest rates wont be as bad as the media would have you believe because most of the worlds currencies have depreciated signficantly against usd so foreign companies who have dollar denominated debt will likely buy treasuries thus putting downward pressure on rates
347867,they delayed payment for the yield on anchor right
347868,if a vc leads a round they will take all funds from others and send it one time
347869,no everyone pays on their own sometimes also different methodscurrencies if you will
347870,eg you can have one investor do a bank wire and the other in usdc
347871,oh i think this
347872,so they took a big money and deposit on anchor for getting yield and rekt
347873,seems like gro protocol vault also blew up during this since they had 60 exposure to ust
347874,lots of unhappy folk who were participating in the strategies through argent and deposited usdcusdtdai and had no idea they have exposure to ust
347875,gro blew up the second time already on top of drowning every protocol participant anyways another 3ac 99 token tbh just gotta look away
347876,
347877,do posted
347878,ruin everyone that stepped in on his posts and plans or listennedmake a new tokencant make this upedit that said most are ruined anywaysbut the pnd and relistings etc are now even more scammier
347879,wait wtf dude that is 180 to the original planhe basically fucked his way out
347880,400m 40 to ust holders prorata at the time of the new network upgrade ust holders need to be made whole as much as possible
347881,lol
347882,when was the new network upgrade
347883,its what is discussed in the proposal has not happened yet
347884,good move of absolving himselflfgtfl of all responsibilities
347885,yeah lots of language implying its up to the community
347886,i was just asking when was this new network upgrade
347887,aka when would this snapshot be
347888,there is no date set yet the proposal fist would have to pass and then some work would need to be done
347889,im not the only one who finds this underwhelming af right
347890,dont forget they probably held tons of ustluna too so also have most of the new community coin too
347891,hes washing hands
347892,now its up to you
347893,to pick up the pieces
347894,called it lmao
347895,on to much better news
347897,also no word on the btc reserves
347898,1
347899,hes keeping them as a good behaviour bonus
347900,
347901,pretty sure he just gave them to vcs
347902,to cover their losses
347903,not a loan
347904,unpopular opinion but if they signed saft where options were usdt or ust why they are wondering today i bet 1 peg wasnt mentioned anywhere in saft
347905,it was vault right then imo it worked out as intended
347906,so cz relists luna on the news that they wanna snapshot and the current token is worthless current token pumps on the news idk anymore
347907,my luna is still gone from my savings acc at binance
347908,its quite interesting i wonder how enforceable the saft is i suspect itll get refunded and they get chucked out of the round
347909,given how teams change vesting and lockups on a whim id say the safts are worthless
347910,teams usually change vesting and lockups cause 90 of private investors dump their tokens the first chance they get
347911,dont you think other stablecoin projects cropping up would drop governance tokens to poor luna holders
347912,
347913,im a poor luna holder
347914,ok who is goin to jail next
347915,
347916,vshvsh the second incentive reward pool did not help what now did leverage parties inject more collateral
347917,it did
347918,it allowed a lot of folks to delever
347919,oh perfect good
347920,solo un poco de volumen new use case for synthetix offer decentralized trading of large scale short derivatives to support crypto backed stablecoins and their pegs
347921,yesterday the situation was a lot worse
347922,i will vouch for you as poor luna holder later
347923,maybe luna will have collectible value like nfts
347926,whats the scary price right now
347927,also he quotes ust price peg from offchain binance books instead of previously referring to the onchain prices and saying binance is wrong
347928,087 i believe
347929,safu
347930,good job on quick moves chads as always
347931,yeah yesterday had some big positions on 096 or so
347932,yeah i think for most cases litigation simply doesnt worth it
347933,tbh i think next time well start shouting way earlier
347934,nan
347935,beforeafter deploying an extra pool allowed folks to delever
347936,400m 40to luna holders before the depegging eventgoody gumdropsthat would be me
347937,which stable iz dis
347938,
347939,steth but as vasiliy said is safu now
347940,i zee
347941,thanks lob
347942,i mean safer theres still 200k of longs out there
347943,just increase a to 10k problem solved
347944,then everythings fine and then suddenly liquidations to zero
347945,aint it
347946,uma could do short derivatives for bitcoin to back stables too maybe all these low volume platforms will finally gain traction
347948,whats op
347950,optimistic rollup chain
347951,just to get an opinion from people more prepared than me is there any chance that ust could go back to the peg using the luna burn
347952,ah i thought u were referring to snx launching another of their own tokens lol
347955,no problem for me im just doing grid trading on ustbusd and wanted to figure out whether to stop thanks for your opinion
347956,such a cool graphic
347958,no rate limits on arbiscan
347959,wen alternative tornadocash ui that coalesces known alt addresses when talking about anonymity set
347961,
347962,i prefered this part

347964,cheers boyz
347965,islandboiz 30
347966,
347967,chances are they pump a shitcoin next week
347968,
347969,
347970,ethalik speaking now
347971,any minute now
347972,nan
347973,any other yield farm protocol with loses i know yearn wasnt in the ust business and probably the other relevant is stakedao
347974,yearn had ust in the pools of curve but no specific strategies in ust afaik altho usdc and dai have exposure to quite a lot milkyklim no
347975,i mean yearn has single side strategies that lp in certain pools none of them was in any ust pool of curve
347977,they indeed had curve lp shares with ust mim and 3crv
347979,yep correct
347980,
347981,safety scores have nothing to do with collateral or liquidity its based on defisafety rating alone on the security of the contracts
347982,if the ust exposure was known and was clearly communicated i see no fault here because many many protocols strategies wanting to get yield higher went into this many consumer apps i would say at no huge fault of their own they went into it because so many actors in the space validated and pushed it forward
347983,and as they were building a product they had to differentiate how else could they so they took the leap of faith
347984,very sad tho
347985,
347986,this i can see though indeed joyceyyc
347987,its not just the exposure to ust i put my stables in back at the new year and forgot about it dao voted in march to add ust exposure they also decided to give it 30 of the portfolio which means 2x leverage in the vault my beef is the inaction after peg broke and the pools were being drained
347988,there should be stops in place 10 depeg even usdt had it is fine but at 10 maybe you should pull out
347989,actually not even sure i agree with myself anymore
347990,because usdt was 10 off peg if you would exit the strategy there youd be a huge l
347991,its not just the exposure to ust i put my stables in back at the new year and forgot about it dao voted in march to add ust exposure they also decided to give it 30 of the portfolio which means 2x leverage in the vault this sounds normal any new collateral onboarding in any new protocol unless done isolated as risk will have similarsame consequences
347992,would have been great but this situation turned into a binary result of eithe repeg and lose 0 or fail to repeg and lose 60
347993,idk what i would have personally done if i were on their multisig no clue what would have been the right solution
347994,probably pull out when 98 was there already and drying up idk
347995,at some point there has to be a quantitative circuit breaker to limit risk
347996,its worth reading their announcements in discord over the last few days
347997,what about this
347998,would u pull out in this hypothetical case
347999,usdt has collateral backing
348000,seniorage shares 10 risk is too much
348001,welp you think it does from risk perspective you dont know it does
348002,and 3crv in a moment was 85 usdt which was a bit scary
348003,sorry for hypothesizing too much
348004,the biggest take away from ust will be that do kwon suckered in millions to beleive he solved the seniorage shares problem
348005,that i wont argue with ser
348006,i think gro is a great idea they just were complacent about risk and tried to boost yield to attract users by exposing everyone to ust
348007,confused though why are you blaming the team for what le dao voted in
348008,they also had cream exposure in their first round of pools
348009,because their messaging with defisafety rating was that it was high and didnt see it for being and algo ponzu
348010,everybody had cream exposure
348011,the cream hack is different than choosing a metastable with no collateral backing
348012,i am not trying to protec i am just saying they are one of 100s who got lured into this yes everyone for themselves but idk
348013,leaving aside what the strategy was better risk management could have turned this into a nonbinary outcome of maximum loss or no loss
348014,quantitative stability analysis is one of the biggest missing components in this industry right now
348015,ive looked into it a little and there are people who are working on this through post modern portfolio theory i dont know the details of what theyre doing but it sounds fascinating
348016,sure but shouldnt the people voting it in look at what theyre voting in regardless of what the marketing label says
348017,pull out
348018,heres the reality it was fun and games up until about a week ago will the story be different if all the usdc andor usdt in curve is effectively deleted in the next 30 minutes
348019,our dao pulled out ust after down kwon started to get cocky
348020,around 10mln saved
348021,yeah so this is really unfortunate we only ever deal with technical risk and as i said earlier terras products are fairly well constructed in terms of audits bug bounties testing docs etc hence the highish scores we give to anchor aperturewe never deal with financial risk thats for you guys to figure out were primarily looking at how products are made and if there are indicators of poor contract building quality rug potential its up to you to figure out whether or not you want to buy the thing being built thats far too complicated contentious to deal with us we have our swim lane and we stick to it
348022,maker gonna do maple if so so they ask for senior tranche type of scenario or collateral of mpl
348023,i read the reports and they are really good from a tech perspective
348024,to say anchor good ust good
348025,but ngl i never expected such collapse i lost myself in ust some shekels due to being stupid trying to arb
348026,anchor is decent product tbh
348027,earn or borrow
348028,beautiful ux good audits great repo the number of people who tried to sneak into their contracts must have been inconceivable and the fact it took a full ust breakdown is a testament to the devs behind it economists not so muchmy normie friends even used it because it was so easy that was a big part of the problem
348029,well anchor earn was a big part of the card house they built though
348030,yeah we definitely set back adoption for few years back with this shit
348031,i really enjoyed using mirror a lot of the terra ecosystem dapps were very smooth
348032,the worst thing about terra was do kwon attitude
348033,great time to be a dev and build rn you can build in a low pressure environment no moon bois complaining why your token hasnt mooned yet you have time to do things right without rushing and if you fail you can blame it on the bear market it wont put a dent on your resume coz you have a good excuse and you can still get a job later
348034,i cant build shit i can compain tho
348035,yes no one is complaining about token prices at all best of times
348037,every project raised money last year every ecosystem has grant programs many made money and angel invest we have more usecases actual businesses really good products
348038,seems like independent financial risk scoring system is a very big gap missing if all other factors are good but coin is a huge scam ponzi we need a more holistic approach else this feels very much like enron and madoff and we were supposed to be better rant
348040,just got my wust anyone here reckon its worth now to hold it for the new potencial luna airdrop xd or it wont cover eth chain
348041,
348042,faced this currenlty can confirm
348043,even the amounts hacked are now in bear season
348044,lol
348045,they will count only native ust on terra chain for sure
348046,
348047,not just etherscan tons of websites compromised
348048,is it real
348049,etherscan dextools curve spiritswap etc
348050,aws
348051,it seems to be some sort of ad service that is injecting the request
348052,when you cancel signature request it persistss you cancel close browser reopen its still there
348053,any solution yet assuming do not accept
348054,anyone can say how to reproduce this
348055,curious
348056,yes it seems to be popping up only when ad block plugin is disabled
348057,i guess use a chrome browser with only mm extension and no other one
348058,where do you disable ad popup within mm
348059,lol
348060,go download ublock origin
348061,use brave browser on mobile dont know about i devices turn the shields up to the strictest
348062,
348063,have an ad blocker on chrome the pop up is not showing up
348065,how they exploit aws
348066,spirit swap and the others seem unrelated
348067,ublock origin is great ads are distracting
348068,fwiw ublock origin and ublock are not the same thingthis is what you want
348069,it literally says ublock origin there
348070,im replying to myself
348071,is it possible to destroy ens like sending it to 0x000
348072,
348073,on it as well twittercomofficer_ciastatus1525230633412337666
348074,
348075,do you mind sharing that dashboard
348076,its parsec
348077,appparsecfinancelayoutqbl_pyie
348078,doesnt fei have a liquidation mechanism if eth price falls too low
348079,bitcoin fear and greed index is 10 extreme fearcurrent price 29287
348080,this mightve been caught by users if transaction details were displayed eg for common functions but the unfortunate reality that a lot of the hardware wallets and wallet appsextensions really just suck and dont do that
348081,take the ledger for example tiny ass screen and it doesnt even display the transaction data by default it just tells you to enable blind signing though you can also choose to display tx data
348082,lmfao keep in mind that they have an agenda too just happens to have a narrative that is currently playing out
348083,iirc it doesnt even display eip712 params you get a hash from whatever youve connected to your ledger and you sign it thats alldoes the nano x do this too or is it only limited to the nano s and the trezor one
348084,yup
348085,they cant load the abi of the contract
348086,cant or unable to
348087,i vaguely remember metamask trying to parse and display txdata too but it also not really working on other networksidk tho cuz i no longer really use metamask
348088,yeah i guess itll take up a ton of storage and theres only so much you have on those embedded devices
348089,no
348090,they dont care
348091,ledger is using this fact to build their own walled garden and trezor well that has to be the worst hardware wallet to use for ethereum
348092,gotta catch this earlier
348093,really re trezor i guess they at least display what youre signing for eip712 messages for example
348094,ironically metamask could mitigate this as they have a phishing database
348095,if they did a dns query to see if the site was recently updated they could add a banner unlikely
348096,they require you to use a webfrontend
348097,and force update firmware
348098,yeah for sure but what im saying would apply everywhere as well you dont have to rely on every project monitoring their sites etc which i really wouldnt bet on happening
348100,ah yeah trezor connect right
348101,you can always use trezorlib eg with frame
348104,yes i had to compile a specific version of walleteth to get access once
348105,
348106,you should probably be able to talk to the trezor directly from the browser over webusb or similar but then you might need to have the protobuf definitions for communication
348107,and those can sometimes change
348108,aka not wanting to implicitly expose themselves legally
348109,
348110,gro was always a shit show starting w their token launch
348111,not the first time with gro previously lost when cream got hack too iirc
348112,if there is anyone from uniswap please guys deploy your add liquitiy v2 to l2s
348113,how much work can it be q_q
348114,
348115,has been sent like 10 times alread
348116,there is probably more market volatility to come how do people feel about crypto lending platforms celsius nexo ledn blockfi etc in the current market condition these platforms are doing okay so far but they work until they dont and they didnt exist before 2017 is there a low risk way to continue to earn some yield or perhaps the focus should be capital preservation over yield at the moment
348118,i think all they need is planning and volatility
348119,plus celsius has a killer bitcoin farming gig
348120,ive been in celsius since the beginning and pulled my assets off this week after years sadly as american ill never be able to use earn side anymore only custody but with market volatility im just going to sit on my funds and see what happens with all yield generation products each to their own
348121,
348122,the good thing is that they have a lot of vcs that can plug holes if ever
348123,to chart every token on every major dex any code tools recommendationsedit yes we can chart ui with tradingview thats the easy part we can get token lists from coingecko or other api but wanted to find new and unlisted tokens tooto find every token pair first of all on dexs perhaps use graphql subgraph or some better methods toolsedit as mentioned below deploy uni v2 subgraph on all evms of interest for pricediscovery sounds like a good start
348126,dex tools coin gecko
348127,i mean on a chain analysis code level to include eg discovery of pairs
348128,unlikely to find someone willing to share code it takes a lot of time and effort to build and refine and everything you mention are commercial products
348129,i will give you a hint you could try tradingview if you want to build one
348133,coingecko coinmarketcap and some others have api than returns all listed coins
348134,and they have exchange data as well
348135,im familiar with tradingview
348136,so whats the issue are you having trouble with creating a website ui
348137,theres a lot more to it than that
348138,nan
348139,is there a usable bridge for dai from arbitrum the ones listed on arbitrums web are kinda dead nvm theirs works
348140,graphql is open for anyone to use there are tons of open source projects youre talking about complete commercial products but wed not want those if doing something new and custom anyhow coingecko tradingview others have apis charting tools but ty
348141,deploy uniswap v2 subgraph on every evm network and use it as a pricediscovery oracle
348142,that will be 10 eth in consulting fees pls
348143,who knows more on thiswhats the plan of frax on it
348144,also if you go that route do know the uniswap v2 subgraph has a bunch of bugs they might not impact your use case but if you want to do more complex stuff like calculating cost basis of user trades its gonna cause problems
348145,any workaroundslinks worth mentioning
348146,whats the purpose of your tool
348147,will show soon
348148,1 chart everything2 3 profit
348149,i mean is this commercial or for personal use
348150,after recent events i am curios is there something like lulzsec for the crypto space a white or blackhat group of hackers or whales that fight for what they think its right not just for gaining from market manipulating
348151,id invest in that could use some lulz
348152,
348153,anyone got an easy to deploy working gnosis safe package for custom evms their docs and repos uhhh could use work
348154,go through the graph protocol migration guides most of the bugs i observed were due to how graph protocol had evolved and created incompatibilities if you really wanna go hard i recommend adding some tests as well
348155,maybe anyone knows what the team at iron bank is after cronje left is it someone in the public eye any red flags
348156,depending on how much work you really wanna do on the mvp it might be a better idea to simply use the univ2 deployment thats on the hosted service
348157,ibcream not cronje its confusing
348158,why two different protocols for the same service
348159,because cream got hacked like 4 times
348160,they rebranded
348161,also ig ib is a collab between yearn and cream
348162,yeah but they split up recently
348163,no afaik they cut all ties almost
348164,all these teams r actually different
348165,oh til unaware of this
348166,idk its all badly communicated
348167,that is because milkyklim didnt hire me
348168,honestly there wasnt a whole lot of cross integration in the first place
348169,but i dont know all the details only 1 perspective
348170,i only know banteg works on yearn im a banteg maxi
348171,bretty much
348172,need open source documentation on projects ngl
348173,fixed forex and cream also not the same anymore altho they use more or less the same contracts i think
348174,nan
348175,
348176,phew
348177,wut people actually wrote a huge post that ib is not yearn
348178,is it on the medium
348179,please send those lets help educate others so they dont confuse again shoot it over boss
348180,
348181,perfect thx
348182,there is no merger for anything but we know each others telegrams
348183,but same teams behind both projects
348184,no
348185,not at all
348186,they are literally all different
348187,
348188,
348189,so ohm is fully staying true to the currency as a product
348190,they decided not to do any pivots
348191,idk in mid bear liquidity and anything price related is super hard re impossible to get growth from
348192,would rather see them become a semiib of a sort but better do smth w their money to create
348193,unless i am reading this plan wrong
348195,afaik thats fully dead question is what happened with the 8 fig crv or was it cvx balance
348196,azeem was involved in mochi righthe is no longer here in group
348197,cvx
348198,is it in the room with us right now
348199,he market brought cvx in 1000eth tranches
348200,yes and then locked up but got rekt by curve emergency multisig so whats the afterstory was it a 4yr lock that now has 0 voting power
348201,not sure on what happened afterwards
348202,where is the money zach
348203,i mean it was all onchain
348204,anybody had the address
348205,whats going on guys whats wrong with cvx
348206,nothing read the comments
348207,he got his voting powers back i think relocked it basically
348209,wait what more info addresses
348210,its relocked for sure
348211,team is still busy with repeg
348212,jk
348213,
348214,lmao u baited me fuck
348215,for all we know they might still improving that jpeg of the prm
348216,bull or bear quietly buidling
348217,i do believe they have a grant program for that purpose
348218,its actually better at being a currency now that it has gohm is trading at a discount to treasury insane
348219,anyway unrelatedly
348220,is there a way to redeem dai for underlying collateral
348221,if not what levers does dai use to maintain its peg
348222,so anyone who bought luna at the total bottom would be a millionaire right now how ironic this can get
348223,where can they sell though
348224,its on binance
348226,individual cdp users can buy dai on the market to withdraw their collateral and liquidators need to buy dai to liquidate underwater cdps
348228,both create buy pressure for dai on the downside
348229,dai could depeg wout any cdp being underwater though
348230,im just thinking if i were to create something akin to maker for a particular token how could i maximize the guarantee of the peg it seems that makers size widespread use does play a role here ie there are enough cdp users that would jump on the chance to repay their debt for a discountif youre bootstrapping a new protocol its a much trickier proposition
348231,so rai had the problem youre talking about when it launched but once there was enough rai supply created from cdps market forcesdebt issuers and liquidators naturally take over especially when eth goes down wish i had a chart to demonstrate this but the mechanism works quite well
348232,of course to bootstrap that initial supply rai gave out rewards to encourage minting i think for maker it was more altruistic from eth whales since it was such a new idea at the time
348233,interesting thanks for the info
348235,huh why is that ser
348236,azeem has a history of letting projects die and taking a stack from it
348237,because you need to buy back to close a short so if something is truly at 0 with no buyers you cant realize the shorts profit
348243,because a short is actually a complex lending transaction if the asset you are shorting goes to 0 there is nothing left to redeem so you win nothing
348244,did you guys see this never a big fan of ryanair but trolling people due to the crypto crash from their official account is a bit much
348245,lol its so funny when node operators have no clue about how blockchains in this case what happens on top of a blockchain smart contracts actually workits cool though that they also dont have to powerful design
348246,looking at their entire online presense it seems to be like this though so they are on character weird had never seen that
348247,so what is this
348249,yeah noticed this i guess we should troll them back id be offended if it was singapore airlines or emirates
348250,a bit much and also somewhat tired from bear whining if you build for value you try to stay deltaneutral
348251,not with your bags but with attitudes
348252,24h volumebusd391287102961
348253,luna at binance
348254,
348255,he is raging what happened with lfg btc
348256,no one knows
348257,or do kwon didnt buy any btc
348258,they said we havent sold any ust or luna
348259,and it is 3ac jump btc
348260,no its based
348261,but they didnt say they havent sold btc
348262,in fact they did sell ust for btc a few days before this all happened
348263,
348264,poor cz being dragged into this
348265,24h volumebusd391287102961
348266,lol at the end exchange always win
348267,dragged into it but he doesnt hold any ust or luna
348268,makes sense
348269,he means he was dragged because people are challenging why he listing again etc
348270,hes listing because he doesnt want to give the fees to someone else
348271,ah right
348272,3b in volume
348277,binance has staking service for ust via anchor
348278,he is trying to help his users
348280,why would u need to use graphql to do that
348281,iirc our devs have used it for subgraph queries
348282,irrc isnt binance one of the few investors
348283,they are investors yeah but they had loooads of investors
348284,so other than an attempt at creating exit liquidity for those affected what does luna v2 fork actually bring no way ust will ever gain trustinterest and remain at peg after what has happened no juicy 20 anchor apy to drive interest could someone enlighten me
348285,just general eth competitor and ust is being abandoned
348286,
348287,this only works with google bigquery but any chain they support should work just change address to factory on that network
348288,dexguru
348289,calculating cost basis is handled by the frontend for uniswap or at least use to the subgraph doesnt have the necessary gas pricing information here are some of then
348290,also use the method called the id technique described in the last example from
348291,its more performant to base queries on an attribute and filter by that attribute
348292,if you dont want to use graphql here is an example using mongodb and rpc
348293,or you can just use blocknative
348294,
348295,ultimately all these ways are trash
348296,if your gonna do it just use geth or erigon and use the graphql api the schema for their rpc not subgraph against rhe db directly much more performant and can handle higher load
348297,and when you invariably want to do queries that are not indexed you wont have to change ur setup
348298,facepalm twittercomryanairstatus1525229490171006981 and cringe never post anything to job twitter account if you are drunk mates
348299,does someone know how many signatures a message needs to be transmitted by the wormhole bridge there are 19 guardians multisig member and there is a threshold for message acceptance but they never seem to mention what the threshold is in their docs
348300,found something says 23 here
348301,i don t think any of the operators after 48 hours of madness made any diff on those prs
348302,23 indeed
348303,is there any lightclientbased bridge in use particularly interesting in such bridges between evm chains
348304,is there a service where i input a token name and find which borrow platform support it
348305,just pure marketing and timely
348306,they have been tweeting some wild stuff lately and most of it related to crypto gurss some young lad that got rekt by crypto running their account haha
348307,
348309,well i heard ryanair is pretty shitty airlines in general not a surprise those cheap fucks cooperated with officials very wild behaviour tbh but also who in their right mind uses ultra low cost airlines if you are dissident haha
348311,what they had no choice its a standard protocol dont shit on the pilot ffs
348312,no politics
348314,bad take indeed the pilots were suspicious but were threatened with fighter planes to escort them down if they dont obey
348315,when ohm falls to 1 actually it might be pretty stable wrt to ust anyhow p
348316,not sure if you know already but look at the date on that
348317,there was only enough liquidity at bottom price for maybe 2k to 50x to 100k if that
348318,it was pinned on their twitter hence i took it as latest
348319,u right tho where is new stuff
348320,how much did rai team need to bootstrap that if any
348321,or were those rewards enough
348322,not much new tbh mostly just spinning their wheels with a bunch of ideas old but less old than the article is
348323,its working as designed problem is working as designed is mutually exclusive with staying at insert high price for too long which isnt great if you bought at high price
348325,theyre tantalizing close to touching on some really good ideas revest has been playing with but they havent quite made the crucial leap in logic thats needed to really have a useful system this just sounds like olympus with fnfts
348326,
348327,lol
348328,whats spread exactly ie how much of the ld is within this 001
348329,spread is usually the difference between bidask
348330,o ya duh k ty
348331,omfg i had independently spent like 2 weeks retooling the uniswap subgraph to calculate cost basis
348332,never knew they had calcs in the front end
348333,or cost basis calcs at all
348334,i want to know more opinions on this while i use in my browsing browser many extensions like ublock origin https everywhere and others when required privacy badger ghostery decentraleyes and many unrelated to privacysafety ones ofc i dont have any other extension apart of metamask in my one for defi out of concern that somehow if one of them are compromised by devs i may get a surprise am i in the wrong there
348335,are you using a hardware wallet
348336,i have hot and cold ones but its irrelevant to say extension x redirects me in the background from curvefi to totallylegitcurvefi
348337,avoiding software wallets will do more than any other protection measure
348338,to avoid supply chain attacks read this
348339,loading a site is a different phase than signing a transaction
348340,my concerns are in loading the site phase
348341,im aware
348342,thanks for the link im also aware than i should check the contracts that im signing but im asking more about if im being overparanoid about that possibility of mainstream extensions doing funny things
348343,theyre not allowed to screw with each other but that doesnt rule out phishing attacks
348344,imagine a malicious extension pops up a box that looks just like metamask and sends a tx to your hw walletr
348345,
348346,if you wanna be really safe have a chrome profile that has metamask and ublock origin installed and thats it
348347,yeah i do imagine but i dont know if im being realistic imagining them
348348,if using a software wallet any app on your computer can technically steal your keys
348349,i dont even have ublock origin installed but when i see curve guys insisting on having adblockers then i reevaluate
348350,always have adblock
348351,malicious extensions are usually resold
348352,so you might have an extension that shows you coupons for eshopping sites it gets really popular so the author sells it to evil north koreans
348353,thats how most malicious extensions happen
348354,this is why i presented the topic about mainstream extensions getting somehow exploited by the devs
348355,your best bet is to use a browser that doesnt autoupdate extensions
348356,not about installing dancing monkey extensions
348357,good point
348360,meh neutral good seems bs shillers
348361,interesting lawful neutral box
348364,1 makes me think we are in a circus as cobie says along with guerrilla warfare between richsmart vs retaili guess there should be a list of ethical vs ponzi vcs in the ecosystem if there is already one plz share
348365,does anybody know if their vault strat includes the labs section too
348366,guys i wrote some bullshit
348367,privacy badger and ghostery are redundant if you already have ublock origin more doesnt mean better
348368,given all the privacy chat its worth checking out been using it for a year and is quite good
348369,
348370,with a few last tweets vitalik is really trying to recreate communism
348371,
348372,idk if i like this a lot idk
348373,this is how you get whales creating 1000 wallets with 1999999 ust in each also this is how you encourage antiprivacyonchain because with privacyonchain such socialized losses are impossible
348374,you can design it a in a way that requires people having ust before the depeg event the only problem would be figuring out how to not overcompensate people who sold some at a loss during the depeg
348375,in this case it would probably work but in the future people will game this especially if it becomes a policy or even just a trend
348376,also something to be said about that tweet explicitly trying to remove personal accountability from small holders removing personal accountability is probably the best way to ensure they stay small holders for life
348377,i doubt it also this is not socialised losses because it wont be paid by other people who also lost its more of a prioritization for certain parties within resolving the bad debt ust created
348378,tankie rhetorics are getting more popular on ctnot a good sign
348379,the argument that they knew what they are getting into applies the same way to small holders it does to whales and you can argue that whales were more likely to know what they were getting into
348380,two words ladies gentlementwo words to fix such situationsinvestor accreditation
348381,nan
348382,if you actually look at it this has very little to do with communism or anything like that its just different strategies for distributing the remaining funds
348384,i would need to see your accreditation papers before allowing you to discuss finance further young man
348385,its just semantics at that point not trying to make a political argument or anything like that treating classes of users differently based on how much money they have is wrong in either direction easily gamed and leads to inefficient incentive structures imo if we can distribute exactly evenly in the future then we should otherwise people will game the system demand doxxing onchain become accustomed to being bailed out or any of the things most people are building in crypto to explicitly avoid
348386,no point in discussing this you guys are making huge leaps with no sense keep the libertarian meme circle jerk up its about as likely to become reality as communism is
348389,quite a lot of sense the message right above yours summarizes everything
348390,do u not like quadratic voting probably not since as soon as you announce it people make more wallets and it becomes pointless again
348391,not really it just makes a bunch of assumptions about a potential implementation of the distribution which we are not even debating
348392,you had 15m and not 800k so you get less back ayoo nah fuck off
348393,either way the fastest way to get all the things you dont want into the space is cheering on retail getting rekt vitalik understands this
348394,vitalik also suggested to lido to fuck their depositors if lido grows too much so they leave maybe i misunderstood what he meant which is also communism well lido wants eth to be decentralized cause it makes eth more valuable then too safe so maybe its a bit better in that context but still
348395,i like the way we do things currently with 1 token 1 vote with some staking bonus applied sometimes the comp emissions vote super close iirc is a good example of how well this can work with entities on either side of the issue weighing in with their expertise as well as their stake
348396,
348397,can you link the tweet
348398,
348399,ah that yeah dont mind him being concerned with silly things as keeping the network sufficiently decentralized not saying this is a good solution but he also acknowledges it has controversial
348400,i did note it here
348401,yeye exactly we all on same page then
348402,andre but less resistance
348403,i am also not in favor of the kind of refund mechanism proposed there in principle but sometimes you have to make concessions to the other party if you fucked up badly the other party being the public opinion and regulators the fuck up being blowing up billions of retail capital
348404,worldcoin fixes this
348405,yes let me scan your retina
348406,
348408,no spem fockers buy our nft
348409,it was a joke but okay
348410,im sure everyone would consent to an anus wrinkle scan
348411,why though would that retail capital have been willing to give up their profits
348412,
348413,it would help restore confidence in crypto regulatory agencies like the sec are designed to protect regular retail folks so the more we selfregulate the less interference from those agencies
348414,it might be a good idea for all the stablecoin founders to form a coalition or association to set standards and selfregulate they can also come up with a system of insurance and intervention to protect each others pegs
348415,stablecoins are definitely one of the top use cases that have emerged from crypto
348416,why would the more conservative protocols be interested in that ie why would maker want to cover mim
348417,mim is just maker but with much more lenient collateral requirements
348418,without a strong stablecoin system btc can go down much further btc price is greatly propped up by highly liquid stablecoins to trade against it
348419,even the most conservative protocols are vulnerable many things can go wrong
348420,thats not really the point here it is about acting in a way that ensures crypto and the ideals you would like to see more widely spread to survive if you just practice your ideology whatever it is in its most extreme form you will only encounter resistance and it will be crushed before the majority of people even get a chance to engage with itwe have been at this point before if you just want crypto and blockchain to exist in an isolated niche of the internet you can be as radical as you want if you actually want to gain ground in the ideological and political landscape you need to be more careful about how you play it the reality is that the majority of the people do not agree with those ideals for nowi get that your concern is that the whole thing might get compromised in the process but that risk you need to tak
348421,kek feel free to deradicalize and see how that works out for you
348422,feel free to check history and the present for any movement that did not do so they all failed either you make it work for the average joe and slowly win them over or you will get pushed back into irrelevance
348423,and there is where we disagree im not a massadoptionist the idea that crypto is only relevant if everyone is using it or something is a funny one
348424,why r ppl still talking about the fountain present day
348425,how far will you go to get to this nirvana of mass adoption which is really a euphemism to get them to pump the numbas up
348426,no thats not what i am talking about i am talking about the mass adoption of the ideals behind crypto not the tech itself as sole purpose you know the stuff you preach here all day dont you want more people to agree with you
348427,you have no ideals to get people to adopt if you keep shifting the line further and further back to appease the current fad
348428,i agree but i believe that this is not a binary thing there is a middleground
348429,not sure really kind of contradicts the whole idea of individualism
348430,in theory but that only works if the playing field is equal unstoppable force meets immovable objecttheres no middle ground between an unstoppable force meeting pudding pudding gets crushed or continues to concede and make excuses
348431,thats nonsense you need some baseline of ideals people agree on in order to have any kind of functioning society but we shouldnt have this discussion here had it a few times already its not going to get solved
348432,different layers ser there are some fundamental ideas derived from evolution these will always stay therebut ultimately yeah the whole discussion is meaningless
348433,i have shifted to agreeing w coiner more and more recently and i dont like that either they are becoming me or i am turning mental
348435,coine_r dont you own lobs why arent you in the spam group
348437,i dont trust the collabland bot
348438,ivan can invite you without it
348440,why ser
348441,ivangbi pls
348442,i own a lobster but never claimed them also because i dont trust any website or bothow to verify blz
348443,technology is bad it will be the end of us
348444,i read this
348446,theres every type of ppl in crypto and vast majority are get rich quick ones on both sides of the smart contract so the whole ideals thing doesnt play out
348447,it actually does even if the conversion rate is low some of those people get introduced to cryptos underlying ideals
348448,this is really funny ill be flying ryanair exclusively from now on
348449,they sent dm to udi about buying hfsp trademark for pair of ryanair socks xd
348450,the underlying idea is to generate profit quickly for most ppl go back 8 years and top coins were stuff like world coin moon coin mega coin where was the ideals decentralized and fair money for all is minority ideal in crypto
348452,what if the ideology itself is the ideology of the hustle culture
348453,you are missing the point it is about the absolute amount of people getting exposed to those ideals if you can choose between people being greedy in the tradtional context or crypto where they will come in contract with the ideological stuff the choice is easyjust think of the amount of people who have read the bitcoin whitepaper or even if its in the context of shilling a shitcoin got introduced to the notion of radically revamping the current financial system those notions do not even exist in the minds of most ordinary people
348454,oh got it now haha mega based
348455,my side hustle was that 20 apy smh famalam
348456,prob 001 of crypto holders have read it today
348458,what would you say is cryptos current ideals maybe im cynical but the current crypto has precious little ideals for anyone to adopt compared to other similar alternative markets the story literally keeps on changing to suit these adoptees just so they can pump the numbers
348459,it is hard to pin down but for me it is about decentralization trustlessness reduction of entry barriers minimizing of central authorities and all those interlocking concepts ultimately it has to do with freedom and returning agency to the individual to me crypto has the potential to introduce those concepts to a larger audience than is currently concerned with it even if they join for the profit they get some exposurei am fully aware that all of this is betrayed a thousand times a day for profit but it definitely shines through once in a while
348460,regulatory arbitrage
348461,is it possible to be big and unregulated honest question can they ever be a big protocol that wont bow to regulatory pressure crypto as fringe market is quickly evaporating
348462,
348464,u got to fit the narrative web3 almost killed the old idea of the pvp market
348466,those are all nice and fine butthe masses are the masses because of the guardrails that keep them on average indifferent if the goal is to get said masses to adopt crypto by any means necessary basically on their terms as opposed to ours that entails adopting the guardrails that make them the masses in the first placebarring a miracle there is no way that happens and crypto doesnt in the very best case end up indistinguishable from the stock and related markets which begs the question what is the point of crypto under such conditions its like terras initial proposal to pivot to daibutwithadifferentname just use dai
348467,increasing fees does not fuck users who are free to take their business somewhere else whole point of liquid staking or am i missing something that forever ties you to lido once you stake w them
348468,
348469,is there an open source example of what should be considered modern and notnaive
348470,yea
348471,
348472,heh
348473,
348475,this is crypto the least he could do is provide some data to back up these wild assertions instead we get lots of random screenshots
348476,rekt on luna nft set to help those that lost could it work
348477,seems like a joke with bad taste
348478,cest la vie
348480,doesnt gnosis safe allow to set capped non multisigned spend limit for specific addresses
348481,better to laugh than cry learn from our mistakes
348482,any good place to start for a deep dive into the whole stablecoin aspects just to be better informed about all the economic pitfalls and research before the next ponzi
348483,check cobies replies in there
348484,hi i was going through old luna threads whats the role of redacted cartel in 4 pool
348485,
348486,voting for the pool with their money to be paid by terra as bribes see convo here
348487,talking about it all with frax team here which seems to be a good place since its both collateralized algo
348488,check latest tho sam wants to radically change it
348489,i wouldnt say radically i think people really took this to mean frax is changing everything which is not true at all we are just making it even safer while still having an actually sustainable algorithmic supply of frax frax is right now close to 90 backed with hard assets with enough pol which isnt counted in the cr to cover all outstanding frax redemptions the only thing we wanted to add was proposing the algorithmic supply being backed by creditdebt in addition to fxs
348490,ah so the majority being amoa stays and credit is just for that cr ratio lets say the 10
348491,exactly i think this got intepretted as no seigniorage capture with fxs or that it is totally new stablecoin not really the case were trying to improve on the model and make it something other algostables can aspire to do too its important to know frax has had pretty much a perfect peg since launch but we dont want to get complacent and think this is the endgame design forever were trying to improve the design so that the algorithmic part of the supply is additionally backed by debt
348492,ah then i misread it my bad ser thx
348493,where can we see the pol total is it the same or diff than the total profits on the bottom right impressive over 12b
348494,the pol is on that page yes but for example the cr is calculated in a much more conservative manner the cr for the curve amo is calculated as the claims of 3crv collateral the protocol has if frax peg breaks to the cr which means that the curve pool gets emptied until frax 88 in reality the curve amo is close to a 1 to 1 redemption of frax for all sellers of frax as the amo rebalances so it can actually withstand 1 to 1 sell offs for its entire supply of 3crv
348495,every amo has an extremely conservative way of calculating the cr which you can see if you look at the source code onchain since it is all open source frax does 0 market operations off chain so it is all deterministic
348496,another example is the lending amos which are similar to dais direct deposit module we do not count the cr as overcollateralized while maker does
348497,thanks sam this helps me a lot
348498,we count the lending amo cr as 100 cr rather than 150 cr this is because the correct way to think about the frax minted into places like aave is that it is backed by 1 of debt owed by aave protocol not 150 of eth that the borrower used to borrow the frax
348499,cool and pol is that bottom right chart
348500,yes bottom right is profits that are still on the balance sheet you can see the breakdown of where the profits are in the top left investor amo
348501,i think the way the governance proposal was written confused people that we are going full 100 cr since it was done by a community member its important to know we arent changing the fractional algo model just making it safer while keeping things essentially the same but backed by more debtcredit
348502,you can also find further breakdowns on dune dashboard
348503,are there any farms for frax apr restake to apy or otherwise auto compounded rewards i ask because with ve tokens farms cant easily claim rewards for users because they cant usually hold the ve tokens afaik rebase like ohm is one option to auto compound curious how frax might do this
348504,i havent done an analysis of the protocol profits since last week but i assume frax is still one of the most cash flow generating protocols in the entire defi space even if it is lower than 200m revenue now that some yields are down i dont think theres many protocols that can match fraxs revenue generation which is weird to see fxs hit so hard in the market rn as you can see in the dashboard the average daily income of the protocol is 317kday thats over 115m annual revenue in these conditions we are in extremely good shape and excelling even in these markets
348505,in coingecko api what do these meancost_to_move_down_usdcost_to_move_up_usdmove by how much
348506,usually 2 but im not sure
348507,nice coincidentally i was just going thru frax and fei docs
348508,not sure but might be directional market depth
348509,sad for the guys whats next now they are cool team active dao not saying anything about token
348510,tokenomic design
348511,ya frax is still 37m positive in earnings this week which is amazingq when profits did fall by half to 12b what happened to frax supply and howig a multisig fully controls the profits fund
348512,and lunaust made curve wars ended
348513,btw profits werent 12b i think you mean frax supply is 12b profits were always 200m but now sitting at around 115m which is a lot but technically lower
348514,yes profits are held in investor amos like the vlcvx and other places and yes treasury msig all controlled by fxs governance votes
348515,we will be a money market product when increasing cr ratio right
348516,if you like tradfi lingo yes i think thats somewhat accurate but i think it is more accurate to say a traditional fractional reserve bank where the illiquid debt and fxs backing is the algorithmic supply of frax aka the liabilities of the bank
348517,oic grant total showed 12b accrued profits shows 40m now where do we see the numbers you refer to thanks
348518,samkazemian fpi will be partial algoritmic or new model with cr 100
348519,115 is annualized in that case 4o is accrued so far i am guessing
348520,the 12b is the total supply of frax it is a little confusing to show it there i agree the profits accumulated on the balance sheet are 40m as you correctly pointed out
348521,correct
348522,fpi is 100 cr because it is a new peg and totally different stablecoin with its own balance sheet it should be 100 cr just like frax started out and it should be even more conservative in my opinion because fpi peg is even harder to keep than the dollar peg since it is pegged to cpi and thus inflation resistant
348523,the current fpi cr is indeed 100 right now
348524,zeframl is big pp
348525,is this wrong 1484b frax circ supply
348526,ya youre right the front end does clearly show 1485b frax on the dashboard
348527,i think the main question that they arw trying to understand is what is backing this 1484b supply godefi right
348528,acquired profits are what frax as product is generating
348529,but if the cr ratio becomes 100 how fxs token accrual value from frax demand
348530,hard assets like usdc deployed to the curve pool technically it is 3crv lp tokens to be specific lending amos also known as overcollateralized loans and other pol on uniswap amos etc
348531,so 12b here isnt related to supply directly rightso q is when this whatever it is exactly fell from 24b to 12b what happened to the frax supplymy guess is amos could have raised the cr to try to reduce the supply but idk how fast that works
348532,and this is another product introduced to the ecosystem to generate more profits to the protocol
348533,this means frax was generating for few weeks billions
348534,before everything collapsed but hey still generating millions and if thats the bottom the sky is the limit with more products and solutions introduced
348535,maybe the highest day profit was 105m
348536,indeed
348537,yes amazing frax still made 35m this week
348538,so is frax also broken or not
348539,this actually should regulate the inflation of fxs to stake holdersnot sure where is it standing on
348540,or what will it take to break it
348541,read 100 msgs above or lets talk about it in spaces tonight
348542,curve falling down depegging hard so any of the underlying collateral then
348543,since like 80 is literally stables via curve lp correct me if wrong it cant fall below that
348544,but that gap of algorithmicity is exactly what recent proposals sam wanna fix and make more durable
348545,to be extra sure
348546,damn i like this stuff more now why did i not lp before fk me anyway will ask sam to print some stablez into gearbox pools soooooon blz ser
348547,im under the notion that no undercollaterlized algo stablecoin can realiable survive given the finance impossible trinity
348548,this is correct and theres enough pol to satisfy all outstanding frax so it is entirely safe circulating supply earning good yield right now obviously i dont want to say 100 safe due to all possible smart contract risks andor tether depegging which are unforeseen events but assuming all those are steady state things are rock solid
348549,samkazemian just imaginationwhat would happened if frax would replace 3pool colateral to 4pool colateral and after few weeks ust died cr would be going to 0 fraximalists just lucky because ust die before 4 pool launch
348550,this is also the same issue faced by central banks and generally fiat money the only difference is that they are backed by an army their model is also unsustainble just takes longer to break apart
348551,samkazemian blz get the printer ready ser
348552,1as i read recently on twitter nothing but i would love to hear a more simple explanation honestly
348553,nan
348554,can you give us numbers breakdown for the balance sheeton one hand we have 15b of frax value what are the numbers on the other side
348555,with fxs liquidity in place too i think below 09 approx it cant fall id be a buyer there tbh given usdt doesnt depeg for real then which likely it wont
348556,i saw that you will connect to rwa how about the regulation and if cr ratio 100 how fxs value accrual from frax minting
348557,i mentioned earlier in another chatfrax community is built on ogs in the space who made money and are not here to make more money rather solve real problems in defisecurity risks are always there and can be out of handswe have seen how the community and ogs are backing the hacks happened in tribe fuse poolsi havent seen a single vcs or influencer offering anything to ust and luna holders yet
348558,i think i asked answered this before that it doesnt seem like the cr 100 proposal will pass and well keep the current system in place as intended the algorithmic supply will be backed by fxs and rwlprotocol credit loans so there is still a seigniorage component but safer than other models
348559,wats the cr atm
348560,sorry if u answered earlier
348561,8875 cr at the moment
348562,you can see here
348563,rwlprotocol credit loans has this already been implemented
348564,keep in mind big portion of the liquidity is locked
348565,we can probably introduce risk metrics based on big unlocks that could impact the protocol stability
348566,no but it is around the corner with fraxlend which just got done being audited by trail of bits this past monday projects have already been reaching out to us to apply for credit
348567,as for the rwl truefi lending amo and goldfinch amo just passed governance too but have not been deployed so those will come in the next 2 weeks as well
348568,how blz gearbox apply for credit
348569,from lunaust event sam is doing nonstop ama
348570,ping our group we can get started on it as early as next week ser
348571,haha
348572,if we can have the answer for this one it will be great before the ama
348573,balance sheet is always live in real time and all onchain to read on the front end just check out the amo tab here
348574,as wed want to see frax supply fell by nearly as much in as the 12 fall in pol aka profits aka frax backinghow was that supply pulled in did amo raise the collateral ratio cr how much
348575,frax supply decreasing due to demand what we need to look is the peg
348576,right but it decreased fast by what mechanism can that happenfrax is returned for fxs because cr goes up some interest rate
348577,why do i need a server like aws hentzer to run snipper mev bot
348578,surely in the case of algo stables monetary policy is a fixed function of exchange rate and therefore the implication of monetary policy autonomy is taken out of the equation which means that algo stables are not in opposition to this theory
348580,do i understand it correctly that this creditbacked proposal for frax would be something like a more elaborate lending amo in essence
348581,latency
348582,what
348583,the problem with this diagram is fixed exchange rate is a red herring
348584,you want to be the unit of account for something
348585,usd has oil
348586,eth has gas
348587,also by definition of having a fixed exchange rate you cant have free capital flow otherwise how else can you enforce your peg
348588,so if i do it on my machine there will be delay of few blocks on my machine
348589,yes blocks do not come orderly this is more important for being able to find opportunities than sending
348590,did amo buy burn frax while profit was falling to reduce the frax supplyor how else could amo have affected such a quick 13 fall in frax supply from 25b to 15bamo can 1 raise the cr is that also on current borrowers can doing that instantly liquidate them if cr rise only affects future borrowers how can it have such a fast effect on supply even if on current borrowers how can it drop supply by 13 so fast especially as much frax is staked afaik2 buy burn yes 3 lower the cr opposite 4 raising fxs1559 the burn rate for profits above the cr
348591,its pretty simple for curve amos the protocol burns frax periodically to keep the pool balanced and deeply at peg if the amo has 1b tvl in curve for example and 200m frax is sold into the curve pool the amo will burn 200m frax and thus only have 800m lp under its control afterwards for lending amos like in aave it burns frax periodically to raise interest rates and get borrowers to repay frax loans this is one of the main mechanisms for how the cr has gone up this week exactly as designed
348592,liquidation fees are there an revshares
348593,all amo profits go to vefxs holders and the remaining like cvx tokens from the curve amo stay on the balance sheet governed by fxs holders so yes basically all the profits from these market operations go to vefxs yield and the treasury
348594,vefxs staking yield right now is 118 apr entirely generated from profits no token inflation
348595,in your curve example can you specify in what tokens the 1b tvl in curve might be i ask partly to better understand the next part where the amo or someone else sells 200m frax into the pool the amo simultaneously burns 200m frax you might mean that the amo burns a different set of frax tokens since it no longer holds the 200m sent to the curve pool right but then the original q is how does the amo have or get those frax tokens to burn in the first placesame for aave example how does the amo have to get the frax to burnty
348596,the curve amo operates in the frax3crv pool so it has exposure to usdc usdt and dai so its collateral is a mixture of those 3 stablecoins currently the tvl amos have is created predominantly in 2 ways minting algorithmic frax supply into the protocol it operates in or directing collateral that was used to mint frax into the protocol so in the curve amo example the 1b tvl it has control of is from frax3crv lp tokens it owns from a combination of minting algorithmic frax into the pool during expansions and moving usdc into the pool from users minting frax for the lending amos like aave it is purely minted algorithmic frax just like dais direct deposit module
348597,
348598,why is the dxy going up when usd is being printed at obscene amounts
348599,theyre not being printed at obsene amounts anymore
348600,well peg is enforced by the change in monetary policy not by capital control
348601,dxy is relative strength index other currencies printing more than the us makes dollar stronger
348602,or for a variety of other reasons not everything is as simple as more print more lower
348603,yeah and dxy composition is 60 eur followed by 13 jpy too doomed currencies its a complete scam
348604,did you watch this guys videos interesting stuff
348605,correct there are other reasons
348606,samkazemian can you describe a scenario in which the curve pool will be out of balance
348609,tldr deflation comes first now and hyperinflation later
348610,currently assuming no smart contract exploits or tetherusdcdai depeg there is no possible way at the cr of 8875 because the protocol controls more than enough pol if one of those 3 stablecoins permanently depegs though then ya it can be imbalanced additionally at a low enough cr then the curve pool could indeed be unbalanced if sell pressure of frax was large enough to overwhelm the protocol controlled liquidity but thats why frax has such a conservative algorithmic supply so that it cannot happen at these levels at all especially at a near 90 cr
348611,what is low enough cr as i see it that depends on the market conditions isnt it is there a limitation on the burning speed
348614,no the cr is the ratio of hard asset collateral the protocol has over the total supply of frax so it is independent of market conditions so at these levels it is fine but if the cr was in the 70s and the curve amo did not have proportionally higher tvl then ya there could be actual runs on the liquidity as everyone saw with ust with barely any pol in curve and not enough btc liquidity if you model terras btc collateral as basically a btcust curve pool controlled by an amo youd see that they would need 80 of pol in a mixture of stablecoinsbtc to reliably stay very safe i dont think they ever got above 20 cr unfortunately as far as im aware maybe someone else that is better knowledgeable of their balance sheet could calculate their highest cr
348615,bout3fiddy is it fair to compare the volumes in the last few days given the chunk of volume was probably people exiting entering on usdt panic arbitrage and a lot of ust pool shenanigans not sure
348616,basically yes probably whats happening now its worth a watch though rewatching it now
348617,thanks for clarifying1 how does 200m frax sent to the pool burn 200m tokens sent to pools normally means sold not burned right i gathered from your answer that amos controlled large frax reserves that they minted when they received collateral in the past and these frax are what amos are able to later burn right2 how do the amos get any minted frax if the minted borrowed frax needs to go to users that deposit collateralis there some other way users deposit collateral to be given only frax rewards so the amos can use the collateral to mint frax for themselves to control
348618,1 correct2 the frax minted by lending amos or even the curve amo is just algorithmic frax supply it is similar to how dai just mints dai out of thin air although thats kind of extreme way to put it into aave without any cdps required to generate it
348619,youre not wrong of course it definitely is unfair to compare volumes but now that theres some form of a level playing field i guess it is going to get a bit interesting to watch
348620,btw weird this has not balanced more yet
348621,maybe cause dai supply is shrinking in general
348623,well the a value is quite high which means rebalancing the pool will take some time as well a values slow down depegs but also slow down repegs
348624,the bonus slippage one gets reduces with increasing a but this doesnt mean there arent solutions to this problem
348625,how about a simple public good stable coin dont pay out fees as profit accumulate them into collaterala simple system with eth as backing fees can be reduced after some supersafe collateral ratio threshold like 1000 cheaper fees and higher collateral ratio than any competitor the public good stablecoin has a clear competitive edge also less risk factors no governance no centralized assets in collateral higher collateral ratio transparent simple data on the health of the system
348626,just need to introduce an incentive component to add liquidity in a direction that balances the pool so it acts like an amplification to the bonus slippage removing liquidity also helps but we dont want to incentivise removing liquidity there are some gameable aspects to this but there are also mitigated something for someone to consider buidling
348627,lusd
348628,sai has the issue of not scaling to any meaningful level its too small of a user base potential
348629,how much is their cr
348630,
348631,rune tweeted about it yesterday cant find tho
348632,the point is that market participants will prefer lower cr than immutable contract that can grow it to infinity
348633,it will have 100m market cap supply and thats it guaranteed
348634,pretty useless to even spend time on such a thing
348635,so it will organically grow as long as it has useand it should always be preferable when available due to the higher cr
348636,can someone refer to an example ethscan tx showing the minted by lending
348637,its a system that is bound to stay small you dont scale cause collateral base is too small it shrinks as a result of that not much potential no uses and it just doesnt go anywhere
348638,the way i see it it can scale but just slow at least it would not have the centralized risks that other options have since its a public good it would need community effort to succeed maybe some daos or projects would like to toss money at it for bragging rights or lock collateral for a year without yield for example that would boost the growthpersonally i would not mind slow if it is properly done
348639,stablecoin adoption has chickenegg issuelow supplycap cant be usedtoo much supply with extra incentives without use case seems like ponzi and its subject of failwhat are use cases of stablecoins1 savings no reason to pay for inout cash to deal with crypto2 international transactions including avoiding sanctions3 trading token for fixing profits4 payment currency for services and products5 trading token as a market for cexes and dexes pairsfutures
348640,check out reserve protocol youll be able to deploy and test different ideas like this for stable coins pretty easily
348641,after ust fiasco i dont think cexes are gonna even closely look to any stablecoins ftx has one of the best stables basket binance has busd and already switching to usd on many pairs
348642,people will get into lusd only after getting rekt by gov with custodial stables and ponzi algo stables
348643,a lot of the rtokens created probably wont be popular but the point is that you can create them easily
348644,why do u wanna dilute our pool ser lusd is so so guys there are better ones
348645,did they get any traction recently last time i checked they were hovering at same mcap for weeks
348646,yesyes bad stuff dont look into it more small market cap
348647,i already have it lel
348648,due to its pure decentralized nature and incentives to stay so
348649,u guys suck
348650,brainlets
348651,their vision is more like build once make contracts immutable the risks are protocol hack and severe and quick to 5001000 but thats my assumptions eth dump

348655,it can never scale by definition no collateralized stablecoin can it will always be gimped by its collateral whether it be singular or several the best you can do is a fiatcoin but none of that is or can be decentralized thats the entire premise of algo stables to break free from the inherent limitations of collateralization and why vitaliks earlier comment about how algos are actually trying to put themselves in the same box as things like dai is ridiculous but i digress
348656,assuming constant eth price and any usage the scale will go to infinity the first is a stupid assumption knowing that any collateral can lose its value what is better in the case of the public good is that the safety margin can be set arbitrarily high no collateral provider trying to find yield in market would accept such high cr
348657,you can pull a lot of shenanigans to squeeze out more leeway just look at dais collateral set nowadays compared to preblack thursday or frax for that matter as well as their proposals for tweaks but gimped the design will remain with the added feature of being relatively trivial to shutdown in more ways than onewhat lusd is good for is being the only decentralized stablecoin out there and practically impossible to shut down scalable is not it
348658,how would my idea be less decentralized than lusd and which one has potential for higher cr
348659,maybe you didnt understand it the whole point is to remove those shenanigans
348660,but the shenanigans are the only way any collateralized stable has any chance of not being limited by any one collateral which is arguably dubious seeing as theyre all highly correlatedliquitys decentralization comes from being immutable theres no gubernance cartel you need to bribe in order to get your token acceptedtweak for favorable parametersetc its not a managed coin which is what dai and friends are which is easy because it accepts being limited by eth with a pretty generous collateralization ratio of 110you would need to figure out how to do the same if you intend on adding more collateral
348661,well that is exactly what i proposed just with more collateral that collateral comes from keeping fees in the system instead of paying them to collateral providers
348662,anyone know how fees work on multichain does anything go to lps nothing in the docs about the fee distribution
348663,but youve done nothing to increase how much it can grow if all you do is not charge feesdivert fees elsewhere its still limited my the only token that can be collateralized eth in your case
348664,so the scale is limited by ethereum and this applies to lusd too wouldnt eth price climb if more of it becomes tied into collateralyes that is a limitation but the demand for the stablecoins is undeniable why not support the ones trying to maximize decentralization resiliency and stability

348672,i hadnt much considered the mark to market implications of luna for a lot of vcs
348673,everyone who spent few hours reading about luna exactly knew what they are signing up for they loved it as it provided a beautiful oneway wealth transfer mechanism from ust acquirers to luna holders
348674,i borrow x and sell it for 1000 then x goes to zero so i buy it for zero and give it back to the lender now the position is closed and my profit is 1000
348675,source
348677,most people are trying to support stablecoins for crypto users there are close to zero projects working on validating a business model with providing stablecoins to realworld users id name one but honestly i dont want to be called a shill
348678,i think what is necessary is to make a system where you can maximize for different variations of possibilities and try to see what the market prefers and uses
348679,of what
348680,basically lol
348681,just need to find a good enough virtual gun
348683,first part of your comment
348684,math
348685,you cannot scale more than your collateral if youre overcollateralized its basic logic
348686,at best its par collateralization like fiatcoins still limited by the amount of fiat backing the fiatcoin basic logic
348689,so with 1000 cr a stablecoin cant scale more than 110 of ethereum value if that 110 is serving a demand then whats the problem in that
348690,that 1x is what it cannot scale means theres no problem with that per se but meh
348691,i am not maximizing for adoption i am trying to enable a public good for people who care about max stability resilience and decentralization
348692,and the current liquity is that
348693,would you rather use liquity with 150 cr
348694,you have to account for liquidation buffer possible price drops etc read their model with troves where it can be liquidated even if cr is 100 if i am not mistaken
348695,lets please end the circular stuff with it tldr is such a system has no growth potential leads to low liquidity leads to a less stable system requires more mechanisms in place or arb to keep things sane leads to nothing has no growth potential the same holds true actually for normal companies the markets less and less want companies that make 2 a year if a company doesnt promise enough new stuff there is no speculative premium talent flees company stagnates there is nothing cool death or ma by the more active oneseverything is a cycle your life your poop regime your boners economics you never know the top and the bottom but at least with you know all assets are always gonna moon anyway i know the company argument might not be as correct given there are boomer shareholderpaying companies but lets see if they live long enough
348696,id say if you dont require redemption then you can change the dynamics either way thats the entire point of algos
348697,we developed a tool that can track and rank premint projects so that you wont miss important projects on premint please try this feature atfeedback from lobasterdao community members is grealy appreciated
348698,i meant that sarcastic waaat
348699,no ads guy
348700,sorrydid not mean to post ads just want to share some alpha hunter tools with loabster dao members some lobsterdao members are already using this tool
348701,didnt see any link in admin log
348702,are there any people transacting things with lusd or are they just holding lusd and nothing else
348703,i would assume mostly like sai v1 where it is used as leveraged eth position
348704,interesting thank you
348705,mm not sure with the upfront fee model from lusd its harder to manage an ongoing lev position no
348706,on the other hand the lower cr allows for higher leverage
348707,some lobsterdao users are using our tool but not via official collab channel however we will reach out to the admin team about offical collab opporunity
348708,just holding and nothing elseuh that fulfills the store of value function of a stablecoin
348709,synthetix and ohm has it in their treasuries btw no a couple daos
348710,are there other functions for stablecoins
348711,yeah its selling point is also its problem its not exciting enough too done nothing to speculate on like andre said lol basically what you said above thats why its marketcap has remained more or less stagnant
348712,
348713,initially stable coin idea was to have a stable trading pair against volatile cryptos but maybe we should rethink what stable means in cryptoland stable against what exactly as you can see dollari isnt stable against yen could stable value token be created using another specs fpi and volt have their take on cpi pegged stables but maybe we need more innovation could this problem with peg maybe solved if we release the requirement to be stable against dollar
348714,if u wanna rethink we have ameen
348715,i am better at asking questions than answering them
348716,what if answer is stable good
348717,i think thats what olympus was trying to achieve have another currency not dependent on everything they are still pursuing that direction though by improving liquidity depths on pools of some tokengohm
348718,hello crustaceans
348719,anyone haz any good content on branding and cold call sales
348720,this guy is on to something
348721,yeah ohm is the only one that came to my mind too
348723,so theres this thing called rai
348724,basically its a stablecoin that tells you how to trade it
348725,yeah reflexer also goes into that direction but they kind of pegged to some value denominated in dollars
348726,it doesnt have a fixed 1 peg to usd instead it allows the peg to float and sets the rate automatically to try and balance the market
348727,if market price is too high demand supply rate goes negative if market price is too low demand supply rates go positive
348728,novel idea ill have to read more about it thanks ameen
348729,
348730,yet they float around 314 dollar denominated
348731,
348732,dollar denominated dollar pegged
348733,
348734,its not like there is any force pulling rai back to 314
348735,buy ohm if you want to speculate on ohms reserve growth imo
348736,but know that the treasury will trade against you
348737,ohm did 1 whole year of 33 ponzi and is only recently realizing that backing isnt just meme
348738,great improvement imo
348739,now u have to buy the nft
348740,ser unblock bitfalls please
348741,100 unblock fee plz
348742,where does rai get this internal pricing from doubt its chainlink since that obviously didnt exist at launch
348743,we picked 314rai to start and initially used univ3 twap as the price feed before switching to chain link for cost reliability
348744,but were still looking into ways to improve oracle resiliency
348745,makes sense do you agree if rai started at 1 and the same things happened with the redemption price dropping the market would consider it ahem a failed stablecoin
348746,this was a brilliant move to set market expectations away from 1 to avoid the failed stablecoin narrative
348747,no
348748,well maybe
348749,at 314 people still think its a failed stablecoin lol
348750,but if your understanding of stablecoin is number go up then yea those ppl would think rai failed
348751,i would argue possibility of number go down is small price to pay for keeping collateral pristine and not having to worry as much about the fragility of a peg
348752,as i see it people me included cant relate to 314 as straightforwardly as 1 so the fact that its gone from 314 to 303 is not as obvious as going from to use your example 1 to 095the upside is its intentionally or otherwise not obvious the downside is its not obvious that includes people not being really clued in on the fact that its a stablecoin
348753,you know there are other fiat currencies besides dollars that are stable
348754,not always 11
348755,i agree never been a fan of hard pegs granted rai isnt pegged
348756,if the end result of this is that we have to break some brains to expand the category of stablecoins include our autist money
348757,ill take it
348758,japanese yen is mentally pegged to us dollar at 1 100 in millions of peoples minds but it actually varies hugely
348759,its 1 129 today
348760,sgd
348761,also its not just about avoiding perception of failed stablecoin its about trying to prevent people from getting rekt who only know one kind of stablecoin
348762,sgdhkd pegged to usd through fixed swap rates right
348763,i mean yea no sir this costs 10sure heres 10367 tokens people will have to do mental gymnastics for all payments terrible ux
348764,rebranding stablecoins from 1 to xyz is just bad marketing at this point
348765,nfts are priced in eth
348766,nfts have 110 the mcap of stablecoins too
348767,im curious though what is the practical difference between and what a rebasing token does setting aside whether or not you believe how it does what it does is ponziesque or whatever tweaking your example a bit token demand token supply token trades above target price rebase rate goes positive to eventually disincentivize holding by minting more of the token token demand token supply token trades below target price rebase rate goes negative to eventually incentivize holding by burning the token supplytheres a significant flaw in that those are not the only disincentives at work but in so far as allowing the price to stay at or below redemptiontarget price is normal its pretty similar no
348768,if the rebase is exactly controlled with the same controller and uses the same rates it would only be a mechanical difference
348769,rebasing is annoying bc it breaks a lot of interior stuff like in theory you could add negative rates to dai by reducing peoples dai balances in their wallet but yea thats kinda annoying
348770,i suppose it isnt exactly the same because we arent actually changing peoples wallet balances just the internal redemption price that rai uses to price the debt eg to determine how much you can borrow and when you get liquidated
348772,jfc this is like a revisit of 2016 nubits chat
348773,rai isnt like nubits
348775,i still dont understand how it decides to just stop changing the redemption price and settle at a new one
348776,algostable is a propaganda term
348777,when the market price redemption price the interest rate settles back to 0
348778,and whatever the redemption price is now is the new peg
348779,
348780,highly recommend you all watch that video it does a great job talking in a nonbiased way about different stablecoins
348781,
348782,whats chad vitalik up to
348783,any explanation behind the slight frax depeg over the weekend
348784,am i reading this correctly swap 2m eth for 750k rai
348785,no he minted those rai
348787,does anyone know if this has been tried before it feels really obvious in hindsight trying to find eips that have proposed the same thing
348788,how is this different from just forking the network at a specific most recent block alchemy etc allow you to do this already trivial with a local node
348789,trivial with a local node yes but not for metamask
348790,a daily routine of most people living outside the us tbh to me it isnt bad ux rather something that strengthens basic math skills
348791,isnt this it
348792,but if youre talking about a metamask integration the main problem to solve there would be to make those events understandable by people
348793,which dont get me wrong is a interesting problem to solve
348794,yeah thats probably a problem in itself and a lot bigger scope
348795,some protocols like uniswap barely emit enough events to get by
348796,its also not perfect for security purposes since it could still be frontrun and the state can change a lot between simulation and actual execution
348797,not sure there can ever be a solution to understanding how a malicious contracts state will change they can emit fake events misleading state transitions all kinds of crap figured it would be better to exclude them from the scope
348798,an event based system might be best paired with a separate reputation system of some sort imagine someone swaps on uni where the pair has a toxic tokenthe sync event is going to come from the uniswap swap pair 1 transfer event is going to come from the toxic token and 1 transfer event is going to come from weth if there was a reputation system of some sort riskconfidence scores could be applied based on the contract that sourced the event the rabbit hole deepens
348799,
348800,from the grantee perspective i can say that during the last funding round almost 50 of all donations failed due to multiple ui bugs previous rounds were great though with no issues like that
348809,he posted it
348810,
348811,probably just deleted and retweeted due to typo or something
348812,i also think that many will soon play enough and do real things in defi
348813,
348814,this framing around budget approvals seems problematic to me i saw similar in some banklessdao projects where costs were roughly 10x compared to commercial services for the same results the people who overcharged mostly left and when new people with more experience showed up to fix the problem the bosses treasury held the new team accountable for the prior overspend and tightened controls ironically removing their agency to make the fixes gitcoin is full of smart experienced people and this seems to be a typical structuralcoordination issue so wondering are there daos without this kind of problem we could learn from
348815,attacker seems done for now 1m on bsc and 300k on eth but contracts are a mess so who knows
348816,not only last round gitcoin as a product is terrible from every point of view clunky breaks all the time stuff halfwork bugs everywhere since before the dao they somehow switched to dao and governance and social stuff and have completely neglected developmentthe idea was to develop decentralized grants 20 but this has been lost inside politics and drama between dao workgroups i hope they figure it out and focus on delivering a single product and not solving all the worlds problems
348817,food for thought on all this algo stable coin discussion has anyone tried banging a couple gans against each other where the goals are to create and break a pegged token a la the 2019 article that made some noise 3 years ago roughly the concept would be to create a multi agent system that is similar enough to a open market blockchain environment to be useful and spit out lots of training data then have some gans attack each other ad infinitum where the cost function is to create the most stable pegmuch easier said than done but given the size of the pot and the cost of large algo stable failures ust you think some lab would be tossing some brains and compute at the opportunity
348818,how many long tails would your project need to resist before it would be considered battle tested
348819,algos are really just not worth anything soon no one will even talk about them i think
348820,peoples memories are short in two years time some new dude with a messiah complex will claim hes invented a perfect algo stable coin and the masses will adore himher
348821,would depend on the reward function but i imagine you would either get a set of agents that can collude better than you could reasonably expect a set of humans to do or a set of agents that just never play any algo ponzi
348822,that would be a problem long tails and novel data events would be an issuebut mostly the post wasnt to ask the question is this better than fully or over collateralized stavles it was to provoke thought and see whether anyone is doing this and why are we playing with bespoke models chess ai in the 80s vs ml models alpha go et al seems like compute is getting cheaper and ml techniques are also getting better quick enough to make models that are more robust than basis cash 20
348823,ha too smart to bother playing the ponzi
348824,i miss the point you want to get from such simulationsany agent with enough funds would just buy lot of ust put them in anchor then start redeeming them through luna selling
348825,this is enough to cause th edepeg event in case of ust you dont need ml for such modelingsee also
348826,the idea would be to also have agents who can change the setup of the algo stable gan side through progressive rounds winner goes on those agents would compete to build progressively more robust protocols that are more resistant to bank runs or other depegging events
348827,protocols are not variables in case of hide and seek game variables are agent paths in space protocol design is much harder to encode than traectoryyou can decide on protocol specifics constants using simulations like curve did when they deduced stableswap invariant
348828,appreciate you sharing this so we are not at a level yet where the machines can spit out protocols that can be tested against agents
348829,im guessing projects you havent heard of are doing this maybe teams that have a heavy ai background
348830,maybe those teams also concluded that algo stable coins are useless for a reason
348831,fair point
348832,and this as well
348833,thats the purpose of a dao create shit and chase money only a few care about the vision
348837,just in the total value of the ethereum deposit contract 20 has reached an alltime high of 12588658 eth 266 billion
348838,imagine if theres a bug on it lol
348839,nice
348841,rai was sold not as a stable but it is a stable but can float down and its not 1 but 314 but its not pegged sort of like ohm which moved from 4 to 1000 and back to 15 towards 1 backing but they want to be a stable for crypto because they have special liquidity when people buy a stable they mean it should be stable to 1 thats the big use case but you want to change that mentality but werent sure you were or werent doing that with rai but now its clear its 314 but isnt not pegged so its fine it fell below that
348842,isnt univ3 oracle free what price feed to you fetch for rai
348843,lmao
348844,nan
348845,the 1 day was glitch
348846,not pegged to any specific usd value
348847,still stable relative to usd
348848,if you want to twap
348849,idk it was early and we launched before v3 well revisit the oracle decision
348850,well then why would anyone use raiboth crypto and mainstream down the road
348851,ever heard of inflation
348852,anyone looked at do kwon foundation and see any btc or axax or whatever they have leaving to eg cexie anyone investigated the reddit claim that 5 digits of btc moving aka they ran off with the money
348853,have you heard about stablecoins that go illiquid cause nobody wanna use them and people only issue them for the tech
348854,for the tech is very diplomatic
348855,how do u think u exit liquid staking when withdrawals and the merge are not yet reality
348856,the futanari type
348857,yes of course but the value proposition of rai and fpi is that theyre stable across borders offering a sort of dampened volatility which makes them a lot more predictable these are experimental projects if they were to go illiquid that simply means they failed
348858,rai supposed strength is supposedly avoiding synth asset class by being very unclear about being or not a stable so like dai mechanisms but no price target or somethingbut people use dai cuz its a stable not cuz it floats like a fly stings like a crash
348859,but thats the point of rai right it floats but not quite like a butterfly and it stings but not quite like a crash
348860,its stable because all market movements have diminished effects on rai price
348861,rai lacks the value of dai being stable
348863,rai is like dai with no targetlike a wheel with no spokes not round
348864,i would assume thats why rai is represented as an index instead of a stablecoin but i get your point
348866,if you live in a geopolitical area where usd is not the official currency then usdpegcoins are not stable from your point of view whereas something like rai would be stableish for everyone in the world
348867,dollar is at least the worlds biggest currency priced in many items online 314 isnt anything but pi and its already broken below it so no more pi for you and is still even tied to 1 but 314
348868,i dont see how that will work if rais price band is within 10 of 314 usd rai is relatively stable to usd and if your currency is volatile against usd you will experience the same volatility in rai
348869,dollar is the worlds biggest currency today but it wasnt a century ago cryptocurrency is not even out of the cradle
348870,fine when another comes you can re target dai to that
348871,ya but some random shitcoin that didnt know if its a stable or not probably isnt your 42 answer to life
348872,suppose the cny becomes even bigger than usd being an index rai would now gravitate to follow cny closer than it follows usd
348873,well then you just changed the whole definition of what dai is supposed to be which is a 11 usd pegcoin not something you can just retarget when its convenient
348874,can you detail the mechanisms by which itd gravitate to cny
348875,then make another daicny
348876,no im not well versed enough in that matter but you can go read about it on their website
348877,of course but thats another token not dai
348878,you should retract your claim if you dont actually know what youre talking about
348879,yea pounds sterling was
348880,im explaining the value proposition of rai not the specific mechanism by which they achieve that also this is just my imperfect understanding
348881,so the lesson is daos should spend more on military than marketing
348882,
348883,
348884,no youre explaining their marketing material at best
348885,and whats the difference between marketing and value proposition
348886,ohh care to expand on that
348888,here is the link to all of your questions about dai and rai
348889,all of your questions are literally answered by nikolai there
348890,if thats their marketing material its a lie or let say diplomatically unsubstantiated as is any unsubstantiated value proposition
348891,just a joke because sambacha said the pound sterlilng was the biggest currency before dollar
348892,no they should learn arabic
348893,for all this noise about stability and breaking pegs youd think the usd itself was stable
348894,not everyone reads websites that way
348895,marketing material can be truebut in this case its being challenged and no one will succeed in proving that a non pegged asset that didnt even know if its a stable will do magic spells xyz
348896,if they take themselves too seriously that thing is going to end up like grin
348897,fwiw there are still fixed pegged currencies in the world most notably the hong kong dollar
348898,iirc the mechanism by which hong kong maintains its free floating peg is essentially like how fraxs curve amo works
348899,where can we read more about this
348900,hi eveybody a bit an invitation yo shill your bags but whats the best way to get exposure to l2 narrative
348901,whats it mean to be exposed to narrative
348902,build a dapp on l2
348903,good answer obviously
348904,when the narrative becomes mainstream and all tokens related to this narrative pump make sure you have some early exposure
348905,
348906,screamsh usdc vault empty
348907,dei is hardcoded at 1 but trading at 77c so think somebody emptied part of scream
348908,yup
348909,
348910,float is another one
348911,garethf cant hardcore oracle prices even if it makes user lives convenient too many cases like this
348912,this is borderline criminal yeah where is it hardcoded in backend dont see how it makes users life easier its just a fetch call to covalent or similar
348913,why is it borderline criminal
348914,there is no way hardcoding fusd or dei price to 1 doesnt turn ugly i mean it could be an oversight but its criminally stupid
348915,in oracle contracts not backend server stuff the user convenience i am referring to is that when you lever up on stable to stable you kinda dont intend to be liquidated or eth to steth so you hardpeg probably was their idea to make ltv better and more utilized but the consequences are the ones you see above
348916,hong kong dollar peg is maintained by 3 banks not by the government
348917,when you get hong kong dollars the cash has that banks name on it its minted by them not the gov
348918,i dont get why fixed peg have bad reputation tbh
348919,don t need an oracle if you hard peg you know the gif like really that would mean there is no oracle involved at all in stablestable lending curious to see the contracts they use it s a compound fork afaikhad fusd ever been at peg since scream launched i think not
348920,wait wdym you see the above
348923,
348924,foobar is calling out rob
348925,rob is saying foobar is a dick
348926,afaik from this thread foobar did some dev work back in the days and maybe other people too but after incident them selling which is totally legal to so revest current team decided that selling is bad and reallocated their funds to community multisig not the first time i am seeing this from distressed price project is that correct to conclude
348927,nan
348928,nan
348929,ah yes seems so
348930,bear mkt tings
348931,ye the usual
348932,we will see a ton more of this
348933,safts changing lockups etc
348934,deploying unruggable vestings
348935,interesting to keep eye on projects with less diversified treasury
348936,bump just to make sure other timezone sees
348937,frax uses 88 cr not 150 like daiwhats the tldr summary of what else it doesdifferentlywhy is below 100 cr an important thing for frax to do well is it eg 12 10088 faster growth or somehow leveraged to a multiple of 12most have looked over the docs but a few paragraph summary of those points would be really valuablethanks again
348938,have you tried poking around the code
348939,was hoping not to have to
348940,if you are above 100 then its not an algo stable anymore and is lowkey a maker copy
348941,why does dai use eg 150 and not 100edit and whats the mechanism for frax to work well below 100 but not at 100
348942,whats your question
348943,at 100 theres not much left to incentivize liquidators to account for sudden price movements
348944,and below 100 whats the mechanism to offset that problem
348945,liquidation
348946,when you redeem your frax you get usdc fxs
348947,updated q
348948,so i guess at 88 cr you get 88c usdc and 12c of fxs per frax redeemed iirc
348949,then zhongfu already responded
348950,dai and frax are quite different in how they work anyway so you cant quite compare the crs directly
348951,correct
348952,ok right btw who gets those things and when on depositing collateral borrower gets both what other cases are there eg what other staking is there fxs frax locking for more fxs frax anything else to mention in a top level summary for mere mortals
348953,dai is backed by different assets when its backed by usdc it has a lower collateral ratio
348954,you can redeem 1 frax or anyone can if they hold it directly on the frax website
348955,to receive 088c 011x worth of frax and i think theres a small redemption fee iirc something in the half a percent range
348956,dai requires minters to hold assets in vaults to back the dai that gets minted if the value falls below the cr those assets get liquidatedfrax just takes the appropriate amounts of usdc fxs and gives you frax the usdc and fxs isnt really yours in the same way that it is in dai
348957,but thats about as much as i understand about it cuz i havent been playing around with it much
348958,you can probably find out more about frax eg the staking stuff is that just incentivizing liquidity through their docs tho
348959,if youre able to clarify the 2nd paragraph itd be great
348960,uhhhhhh i guess the usdc and fxs just belongs to the protocol after that so you wont necessarily be able to get back the same ratio of usdcfxs when you choose to redeem the frax later
348961,eg if the cr drops further youll get less usdc and more fxs
348962,da
348963,oic well explained now
348964,on 1 can you clarify this one please 200m frax is sold into the curve pool the amo will burn 200m fraxif 200m is sold how can it be burneddo you means1 a different 200m is burned when any 200m is sent sold to curve poolfrom this message
348965,sers the basics please find in the docs or read sams messages from ctrlf or in their chat these questions are too specific basic sorry we are flooding a bit w the normal things
348966,
348967,yup thanks too much for here
348968,np but tbh i did find and correct some misconceptions of important aspects of the product just asking basic questions like what backs the frax and it was first agreed to be the pol aka the grant total profit the 12b that i mentioned in screenshot but then not that then that was said to be the supply but it wasnt the supply and that all led to good clarifications all aroundthe q about how tokens can be sent simultaneously burned seems generally interesting and i dont spot it in the docs but fair enough moved the the q to the frax channel ty
348969,is this a fair open ended question for this channelit seems broader and appropriatewhat would grow faster if launched today at the same time dai or frax whyedit assuming what we know now
348970,as commented by someone earlier generally on stablecoins guess it suffers from the demandsupply problemwhile they launched in a volatile week when eth had high ups and downs in its price and they demonstrated the ability to keep the peg in range problem is theres no demand for their stablecoinalso their stress testing of peg was limited to their advantage of being low cap and thus low in circulating supplyhavent seen any project coming forward to trust float yet afaik
348971,imo any answer to this question would likely be speculativeyou could say that since you need less per frax minted vs dai for any given amount of capital youd be able to get more fraxyou could also say that since the frax concept is less battletested since were assuming a situation in which it just launched users would be more skeptical of itwho knows
348972,you could also say that dai utilizes volatile collateral providing a speculative use case to the stablecoin too rather than using stable amos
348973,good i meant assuming we know what we know now but theyre both relaunched or whatever explanation patches the scenario
348974,idk imo it makes as much sense as asking if we discovered apples and oranges today which would people prefer more but maybe someone else will have a better response to your question
348975,a fair answer to oranges vs apples might be theyd like them about the same as now because theyve both been around for so longalso the analogy seems a bit faulty because in the stable coin qthere are at least math economic reasons we can work through to highlight their strengths and think about market game theory liquidity etci think it was a good exercise but the answers given so far may be the best anyone has so thats that ty
348976,and the point of the q was for anyone possibly thinking about novel stablecoin mechanics to consider what other aspects to embrace those of dai or frax
348978,gianksp congrats but if u wanna shill u need to be a lobster dd
348979,what do you mean
348981,buy the nft and join u shrimps
348982,u need to hold the shitty nft to have the rights to shill kind ser
348983,thanks for answering politely
348984,ps dont force metamask connect before a user gets a chance to view the page content feels malicious even if not
348985,thanks you mean on the builder app or as an nft marketplace visitor
348986,i opened ur link of the main site and immediately got a prompt
348987,right will fix right away
348988,they cant be launched today at the same time the conditions that has led to launch of frax is dependent on dai giving the confidence that a stablecoin can exist without being completely centralized if it wasnt dai something else will have to take its place making a new dai being launched today completely redundant
348989,i think you saw i wrote assuming what we know nowit wouldnt be a dai copy on eth in the thoughtexperiment it would be the 1st and only dai and frax on say marseth the answers given already was helpful1 dai allows speculative collateral but has higher cr2 frax holds stables but has lower cr can print more frax per collateral
348990,sorry this is too much mental gymnastics masturbation
348991,would suggest to not move further w this convo it seems to only inspire some fugezi
348993,discussing concrete designs unless found in ctrlf is totally fine though
348994,np answer already given you broke it down very well wrt to the cr vs specualtivestable collateral
348996,thank you
349002,asked yesterday asking again now anyone building uxd on ethl2
349003,yes well i just mention it as an example of another pegless stable coins which in my opinion serve a better purpose as crypto native currencies similar to how national currency has to keep some stability or relatively tight ratio for sake of international national trade interests whatever that may be main issues with these legless currencies is 1 pmf2 marketingexample of monetary policy in macro forex for the sake of pegratio would be cnyusd if it becomes too expensive then they become less competitive as far as international trade is concerned so their interest is to keep it within a certain ratio of usd and this dictates to an extent their monetary policywith crypto pegless stables what is the reason besides just arbitrary or reduction in volatility to target a specific pegrange none have come up with a good reason or pmf one example of pmf monetary policy theory for crypto native currency would beusers would be crypto natives themselves this will drive demand external demand is irrelevant the reason they wish to hold is as a lower volatility asset not as a high beta and not as negatively correlated asset to bitcoin as example this kind reasoning behind monetary policy reasoning i have not seen so most miss the point and dont find pmf my opinion at least
349004,
349006,
349007,313 btc moneygone
349008,where are the rest of the btc lol
349009,used it to buy ust when it was 098usd by the looks of it
349010,idiots
349011,so the biggest remaining stack is avax which they gonna dump to compensate what they can
349012,33m in avax practically nothing
349013,also most of avax is locked up only small amount is liquid
349014,not idiots its how their system was supposed to work
349015,not sure how selling 50k btc otc is the most efficient play at saving peg surely well timed public market buys would have a greater effect
349016,stupid system then
349017,they could have saved the peg if they supported the price much lower
349018,and then burned the ust
349019,it means they have a huge incentive to restore the ust peg now though
349020,but they have nothing to restore it with all they have now is debt
349021,still around 1 of current circulating supply in a low liquidity environment
349022,is that a mathematical fact
349023,ah yes trading discretionary with a stablecoin
349024,they did anyway
349025,please dont rediscuss the same shit all over again especially w such arguments
349026,yea 11b ust supply current price 01
349027,its not that they are not rekt but a system as flawed is
349028,and then bought luna with that ust
349029,wait really i missed that
349030,but theres no way we can see if they actually did this at these prices
349031,nan
349032,their was no system in place yet this was all done manually past few days
349033,they could easily have transfers btc to other wallets
349034,since this was binance and gemini
349035,theres no way to validate those amounts they are saying
349036,who said it was binance and gemini
349037,onchain
349038,tx
349039,this
349040,from there they could have sold at any price really
349041,and they could pocket btc to other wallets etc
349042,this has details
349043,
349044,yep
349045,they completely ducked up the treasury lol
349046,i actually called this when btc was at 47k
349047,transferred 52189 btc to trade with a counterparty net of an excess of 5313 btc that they have returned for an aggregate 1515689462 ustmakes it sound like singular counterparty not exchange and market dump unless binance and gemini were acting as otc agents still not single entity tho also cz at least made out like he had no clue what they did with lfg btc surely he would have been made aware of that
349048,buying ust buying luna
349050,the counterparty was jump capital
349051,rough calcs show they traded 3b into 100m
349052,jump likely made a load of profit from all this but well likely never know
349053,buy 83k btc at 47k and unload at 30k within 2 months masterful
349054,4 lfg directly sold 26281671 usdt 23555590 usdc for an aggregate 50200071 ust
349055,they traded 883m ust for 221m luna that are now worth 50k
349056,jesus
349057,i dont know why everyone is so shocked system was designed to work like this it was a poor design
349058,what if the counterparty was do kwons wallet
349059,staked eth projects like steth by market size any good link for it
349060,i guess well never know
349061,these were manually executed trades not a system
349062,whenever anyone makes a shitty trade from now on they can always look back and think yeah but i didnt turn nearly a billion dollars in 50k in the space of four days
349063,
349064,that does take some serious skills
349065,whomever traded with lfg otc managed to offload a huge sum of worthless ust luna id love to know who it is
349066,jump
349067,czs response is a masterclass in pr
349068,well they traded on their behalf doesnt mean they were the ones that had all the ustluna to dump
349069,but maybe they were idk
349070,also masterclass in holding from 3 million to 16 billion to 3300 us dollars
349071,
349072,16b is dust to binancecz
349073,from 3m initial investmentdoubt he minds
349074,might just be a few minutes worth of trading fees nbd
349075,16b is alot of money why count is as just 3m
349076,but there is no more 15b to make anyone whole
349077,or did i misunderstand the tweet there
349079,yea if binance has 3300 to backstop not much happening
349080,its 16b in unrealised gains cost basis is 3mil unrealised gains is imaginary because moment a wallet of that size moves you have what happened to solana happening
349081,correct
349082,makes sense bdw did anyone able to find out if multicoin sbf selling sol
349083,crazy its like they are locked or something
349084,diamond hand
349085,bdw i saw this tweet yesterday cant find much susbtance for the allegations but i know spoofing orders exist on centralized exchanges a lot i have witnessed them many times while trading
349086,ser long time no see
349087,what does it mean
349088,yeye alameda made trillions go up in a second sure yes btc manipulation not even usdt etc
349089,bitfinexed sends you regards
349090,oh shit
349091,this reads like 10 truth followed up by 90 nonsense
349092,yes
349093,they hedged im pretty sure of that nobody will tell you that tho
349094,binance is luna validator right i dont think cz lost all
349095,this guy needs help lmao
349096,i dont understand why fusd is overcollateralized depeg to 08
349097,
349099,old af article is this beccause of roosh and onchain liquidity not able to meet the demand of dumping hence undecoll now i am just speculating trynna find the design
349100,what
349101,so its not dynamic
349102,80k btc where sold already in otc deals for ust 11
349103,another crime
349104,is there a crosschain dex aggregator by cross chain i mean a single sale that can be made on different chains at the same time
349105,thank you
349107,please less useless pitchforking and conspiracy theories thats plebbish
349108,this is true no one cares for ur theories tho
349109,
349111,
349112,will be banning for retardedness
349115,nan
349116,spam muted for a month were warned
349119,is such thing is even possible by designissues security bridges latency it takes a long time consistency every bridge is issuing its version of wrapped assets cost you have to pay fees on all chains
349120,
349121,im not sure if its possible by design but considering the points youve made it seems unlikely in the near future thanks for the link
349122,anyone know anyone from burnt finance iv done something similar to their burnt banksy proj wanna talk to someone senior on their team
349123,posting this here again please watch the video and spread it very simple breakdown of different stable coins and what caused terras demise
349124,i woke up and saw a lot of comments that could have been answered by the information in that video
349129,
349130,bud hey bud if i give you 28b will you trade crypto for me me surebud howd we dome rekt soz
349131,yeah thats what this was
349132,which i think is fine they used those funds as they said they would and they publicly stated it
349133,but its after that theres the issue when they managed to use the other 3b without so much as a single post to tell the community
349134,plus theres no way at least now to verify what they are saying
349135,any list of the current ust holdrers by supply
349136,the main error was burning btc to try and save the peg
349137,great video thank you for sharing
349138,you are welcome
349140,whats rwl sorry thanks
349141,you need governance to change fees add collaterals chagne parameters etc why dont make governance but include everyone on it one vote per person via some sort of proof of humanity
349142,i dont think any of those need governance one collateral one fee can be automatically reduced at high enouh cr what parameters
349143,it has a few gotcha one that loans arent free as they advertised but you pay fee during the borrow tx second your liquidation can be with way higher price if the whole project overcollaterisation gets lower than 150 its 191 right now the main thing that ther business model is liquidations ie more users liqduates more profit for the system questionable ethics imho
349144,makerdaos dai needs quite a few veriable paremeters such as interest borrow limied how much you can borrow vs particular assets liquidation settings althoug its quite basic in maker system add new assets etc
349145,it could also be without the cdp framework all fees go into collateral cant mint more if cr is below 400 for example the whole circulating stablecoin supply could be redeemed immediately a small governed version of this is running on ergo chain called sigmausd that multisig governance has not been used at all the djed on cardano will be a centralized version of that model
349146,
349147,yikes
349148,yea i got the message he apologized to me after this
349149,
349150,few clarifications1 liquity advertises loans as being interestfree which they are there are no interest payments just a oneoff borrowing fee 05 of borrowed amount2 liquity does not earn anything on liquidations liquity more precise lqty stakers earn through the borrowing fee above redemption fees redemption is if someone exchanges 1 lusd against 1 usd value of eth anyone liquidating a trove calling the liquidate function will be rewarded with 200 lusd 05 of the liquidated positions collateral
349151,never change your life to evade taxes anon when they see the lost revenue come to light youre back at square one
349152,lobster daily 412 daily recap 15 may11 any good place to start for a deep dive into the whole stablecoin aspectslink to discussion 12 a simple public good stablecoin with eth as backing fee accumulation as collaterallink to discussion 13 rethinking the stablecoin idea pegging to what and howlink to discussion 2 gitcoindao overspending link link to discussion 3 rekt on luna nft set to help those that lost link link to discussion
349154,lmeow selling ust with 60 cent for btc
349156,not proven only rumours for now maybe the case we will soon find our most likely
349159,anyone knows if erigonakula on par with geth for realtime mempool data just trying to budget for setting up a node
349160,out of context imo can call a dick any of us if you just copy paste the part where you right
349163,just in source from 3 days ago
349164,want to share this here feel free to provide feedback i believe its worth sharing
349165,still bad many ppl relocated there because of the crypto friendly tax regime
349166,no legal in here this is ok for kingdom legal fugazi from couch warrios is all redacted
349167,the plan is to assess how to tax stuff no concrete dates nor topics were discussed the leftwing be wants to tax everything related to crypto but the finance minister plans to study and evaluate this new realitya primeira dificuldade com que nos temos deparado e provavelmente a mesma dificuldade que a sra deputada se depara para poder colocar com rigor este tema porque desde logo nao ha uma definicao universal sobre criptomoedas e criptoativos theres no clear and universal definition of cryptoassets and cryptocurrencies so we need to overcome this difficulty
349168,so just a nothingburger
349169,didnt see this posted but starknets bridge is launchedhas anyone used or built anything on starknet yet other than immutablex and dydx
349170,disclaimer just dont forget that starkware itself is alpha and for now centralized dont go all in just yet
349171,do they have a timeline on getting to full launch for bridge
349172,im not sure what the roadmap looks like rn the bridge should be mostly ready i think its the l2 itself thats still in alpha
349173,at what point would it become clear they are just boiling frogs they wouldnt suddenly announce a change as a surprise right
349174,the bridge should be fairly simple and safr comparatively to actual crosschain bridges since it just leverages l2 messaging which is native to starknet
349175,
349176,if its fully backed where is the algorithm would that make an algo fiatcoin since its not entirely fiat reserves
349177,yep no surprise changes will surface no one knows how to even deal with the problem of taxation here its really just incompetence and ignorance joint together tldr about alignment1 lobby to delay legislation2 when it comes lobby to soften the blow3 bet on educationfrom the pt crypto associations
349178,maybe incompetence maybe not i wouldnt wait around to find out anyways not anything new being discussed it is what it is
349179,speaking about this in an objective manner anyone know about the underlying mechanics of fusd seems like its a very bad time to be rolling this out
349180,is this it or no blockminded
349181,nan
349182,wait
349183,so it is an snx early style design where they thought it d never go below 03
349184,cloudflare to launch ethereum validator nodes
349185,lol ivangbi
349186,fucking rug my stonk down so much ignoring
349187,cloudflare has a stonk
349189,nan
349190,net is the stonk
349191,oh man its down bad
349192,ye no fuk
349193,smells like an ipo stonk
349194,ytd all tech stonks down 80 net not an exception imo
349195,hmm sounds like they got listed on ftx
349196,turns out microsoft and google are cloudflare investooors
349197,yeahrevenue growth 50 yoy but opex crazyop income is still big ve red
349198,probably better for the network to have cache layer if rpcs dont already
349199,oh boy
349200,like cloud flare cant close access so its net positive
349201,you never really need to close access for things like these
349202,they let tor run free after all
349203,boiling the frog slowly is far more useful than letting them find a new home
349205,dyumyumy since when u think is ok to share 100 the only twitter messages
349207,mute thats just rude puke cheers
349208,is ibc really at the same level with zk on the charti thought the recent terra contagion scare shouldve brought it further left seeing how a compromised chain could forge invalid messages
349209,if ibc is there where would polkadot xcmrelay chain sit
349210,ibc is not in the right place there
349211,ibc should be on the liq net part and xcm should be on the rightmost dot
349212,do you mean xcmp i think xcm is the message format and xcmp is the vechicle
349213,correct me if im wrong
349214,yeah
349215,xcmp well hrmp right now the point is shared security vs not shared security
349216,one thing im not very sure about is the xcm over bridge
349217,i think this is the only authentic way for connecting ksm and dot
349218,but if we do so doest it mean some asset will have security downgraded to ksm level
349219,eg ausd acala unified their stablecoins so kusd become ausd
349220,fusd is live for two years now the only thing missing was liquidations thats why it was never at peg 1 it was released before fantom had any on chain activity or projects not to mention low mcap
349221,bank licensed by government
349222,independent quote unquote
349223,i think this is a valid assumption
349224,wat
349225,you can already use cloudflare workers for cache if you want to
349226,rpc providers already aggressively cache certain requests
349227,
349229,yes sir its ok now
349231,
349232,
349233,hearing some rumors that frax is having trouble is this true this is the only place i hear about frax
349234,no trouble so far mechanism is working as should in contracting tvl
349235,what kind of trouble
349236,so basically he is gonna reward who holds ust at 275 i dont get it tbh
349237,and lp owners dont get a dime
349238,this is probably one of the worst takes i have ever seen by them they will reward people who in theory arent even rekt by the peg they can simply buy now and get rewarded plain stupidity
349239,275 is launch
349240,tldr necromancy
349241,all good bois crypto and memory doesnt go along very well
349242,sounds like a pump plan
349243,sound more like they are scooping ust and trying to airdrop the new chain on themselves but it will be branded as community chain tldr they are filling their pockets again
349244,we go again
349245,they already have a bunch of ust i would assume it might be both get a bunch of it for themselves under the guise of community owned chain and then hedge out some of their holdings if it pumps up
349246,nan
349247,just trying to run his ponzi again do is so shameless he has started shitting on people again
349248,
349249,mb we need some entity that wont influence protocols in any matter but will judge their ponzipotentialpublish reportslike cochrane in biosciences but in crypto
349250,heh if youve ever gotten into an argument with people in ponzis and i dont like it but ill call it a ponzi youll realize the problem
349251,yes choosing independent and unaffiliated researchers for such a report would be the trickiest part
349252,probably the most common question ever but how do you sync a geth nodebeen stuck at 99 complete for hours in terms of block count 18hrs syncing and no idea if it takes hours days or weeks to complete from hereon ssd 16gb ram aws m5xl instance everything set up right feel like im back in 2018 and nothing has changed
349253,anyone here using fluid finance
349255,before deleting messages or banning for anyone here using x admins are checking mutual chats to verify is that spamshilllarp or legitu ser belongs to lobster alpha chat u ser has immunity more about gated chat
349256,which chain
349257,yep sussy semantics in my message
349266,eth
349267,mainnet
349268,stuck at this for hours
349269,i mean keeps progressing but never fully catches up wondering if theres a way to get an idea of when its actually nearing completion as currentblock isnt a good measure
349270,also stuck here for ages even though it looks as if things are happening its not using more storage
349271,lots of stale heal in progress
349272,googled it a bunch everyone complains about the same the issues online but after a lot of googling i dont actually have anything that moves me forward
349273,what are the parameters cli flags you are running geth with
349274,if you dont remember you can ps auwx grep geth to find
349275,as long as you passed them in when launching geth
349276,usrbingeth syncmode snap http httpapi personalethnetweb3txpool
349277,and if iops is the issue does this look like enough
349278,aws
349279,any idea wtf is thatt11s dropped his ens
349280,this should not be an issue how long has it been syncing
349281,roses are redviolets are bluewe are gonna get ruggedand do kwon is gonna get away again too
349282,coming up to a full day 20 hrswhich isnt completely terrible but its been at that close to finished state for a good10hrs or so is there a way to know when its actually getting close to done
349283,
349284,its fascinating how cosmos is always always late to everything from the narrative perspective
349285,so is near
349286,not saying anything bad but just fascinating from the narrative point
349287,definitely taking way too long i dont usually use snap sync but usually checking the rpc as you have been doing is generally fine for assessing status not sure what could be wrong in this case ill ask around to a few peers have been spinning up new geth nodes recently
349288,whats the best place to ask about this stuffthe challenge theres 100s of these questions online posting similar screenshots and data and it seems most responses are and maybe they eventually figured it out
349289,nomura moved into crypto i think its first bank that is trading defi if coin desk reports are to be believed be interesting to see if this causes others in tradfi to movei really want them to create nom with staked tokens yielding nomnom
349290,theres an eth irc channel on freenode where the geth devs hang out
349291,theyve answered many of my questions in the past
349294,can someone explain this to me btw just why
349295,why not slack or discord or something that isnt from 20 years ago
349296,personally i prefer irc to slack or discord
349297,what are your cpu usage io wait stats like it seems your node is processing blocks to verify state and you now just need to wait
349298,nan
349299,how do i get io wait stats
349300,iotop
349301,or htop dont recall off hand which has it
349302,iotop
349303,oh unavailable guess thats because of aws
349304,would have thought i could be using more resources if its still processing
349305,maybe ill wake up tomorrow and itll be done wish i had any indication if its getting close or not
349306,ah it doesnt look like the geth cache has been expanded its only using 2g of your 16
349307,add cache10240 to give it 10gb
349308,thatll leave 6gb for the rest of the system and other geth components
349309,i believe the default was only a few hundred mb
349310,youre node is currently finished downloading the latest snap and will continue to trail by 100 blocks until it is finished converting the snap to am expanded state trie thats the healing values and log lines youre seeing
349311,project builders who have interacted with crypto focused vcs can you recommend any good ones any help would be appreciated in sifting through them
349312,sbi is also already active in the space definitely not the first bank theres already a handful in switzerland alone but maybe you were referring to japan only
349313,hi all is any place where can i report an address which stole my whole wallet balance lps staked etc
349314,ive made a huge mistake with a scammer pretending an admin from hop exchange using same details photos etc
349315,if the scammer reached out on telegram you can report to notoscam
349316,via discord was
349317,i guess you could try speaking to etherscan but im pretty sure they only tag wallets that do larger exploits
349318,try contacting amlbotcomhelpyou idk if that helps but these guys are from crystalblockchaincom mb try just asking them where to report an address i guess it fits free consultation
349319,thanks will try
349320,way to humblebrag you have too many offers feel free to dm me a list and i will let you know which ones i have xp with
349321,updated it if this works i for sure need to post this in the other 100 threads online complaining about the same issues
349322,seems like it was going over a few hundred mb ram here regardless though
349323,ah now im starting to see higher numbers with cache could be good
349327,heh well we did but we turned them all down we have enough to build and wanted to stick to defi core principles now were thinking that an extra 2 solidity devs would allow us to accomplish what we need to a lot faster i want to see what they have to offer the good ones
349328,will dm you
349329,use erigon its that simple
349330,you will be synced in a few days
349331,the article was released before that incident but good point which arjun_crypto13 might want to review
349332,lemma finance i think
349333,any disadvantages to using it
349334,is there any way to see what change in a curve pool gauge weight 100 vote of a certain amount of vecrv would have
349335,where is this chart from btw
349336,looks like parsec to me
349337,thanks
349338,yep thats parsec
349339,yeah but i still think ust is trading way above any reasonable valuation implied by the airdrop
349340,so do you think the ust price should be even less than now
349341,yes what do you think the raange for possible marketcap is for the 1000000000 new luna tokens being airdropped
349342,i think between 2 billion and 4 billion marketcap
349343,80 confident its within those
349344,sooo at that marketcap 004 per ust if new luna mcap is 2b and 08 per ust if new luna mcap is 4b
349345,buy curious do hear others thoughts
349346,hmm isnt that agoric
349347,i guess they changed the name of their stablecoin
349348,lol well the whole world has heard about them now
349352,agoric is the chain
349353,yep
349354,hey sers does anyone here know where do people ask the technical questions for solana related stuff from my understanding theres no specific stackexchange like the one ethereumbtc has
349355,any idea if theres any other platform they use aside from discord
349360,i love the new info text
349361,nan
349365,literality everyone is try to fud about stable coins what a bs is that
349367,
349371,eth rarible dead foundation losing badly but has artists looksrare still fine farming rewards coinbase still not launched must watch 2022 1 geniegem good working model zora nice websitesol magic eden won fraktal jumped late will try to gamefi can work solana nft bigger eth nft opensea vs magic eden must watch 2022 2
349372,coinbase launched its just that no one cares and thats a lot of hopium on solana based on one pump
349373,i wonder why rarible didnt gain more traction i think they were the first nft marketplace that introduced token
349374,u missing sudoswap tho
349375,i think the site wasnt as performant at first and they were missing some features people wanted layoutwise
349377,ur missing nifty gatewayi think a big piece of raribles misstep was the early community like they managed to attract so much loweffort stuff partly as a consequence of how rarible v12 contracts were setup 1 minter per type much of what was there was on there because it wasnt opensea
349378,missing x2y2 as well 05 fee is a killer feature
349380,whats the current definition of interoperability i feel that this word is being used loosely or i might be misunderstanding something pardon mewhen people discuss multichain interoperability or crosschain interoperability do they just mean evmcompatible bridging between nonevm chains to help smoothen the smart contract code and deployment between chains
349381,discord is it
349382,its used as a buzzword mostly i would argue the true intention of interoperability should be native interaction back and forth not just wrapped or embedded via evm or similar
349383,had the same thought curious to know if there is any protocol or application that has already achieved this native interaction part even for a small bit even for bridges i have yet to notice any native interaction of tokens and chains
349384,polkadot mostly i think has valid reason to claim they have interop messages are guaranteed to be passed along and to be interpreted correctly all under one security model
349385,cosmos all these zones talk to each other
349386,this is a good take spree is the reason why the execution of the messages is more safe than ibc
349387,one of two reasons the other is shared security but yeah the ability for one chain to understand a message sent by another completely unrelated chain is a pretty big deal like having a shared library between them all that they all subscribe to to indicate intention to properly parse and process a specifc type of message
349388,here is a good thread on the topic too
349389,one of the main challenges with interoperability is indeed security as some here said what good is it if assets can be transferred across chains that have an inherently centralized validator base because they went through the typical 5 presale and vc rounds at launchid argue the biggest hurdle to interoperability is not necessarily to make it technically possible but to actually find two chains who are sufficiently decentralized so that security is maintained
349390,same goes for crosschain bridges not sure if there are sufficiently trustless ones that dont just rely on a small set of multisigners multipartycomputation should be the minimum for any bridge id argue that any bridge just using simple multisig is inherently insecure
349391,i guess this is why so many btc maxis hate the concept of wbtc on ethereum
349392,im surprised atomic swaps have not yet replaced the risky practice of bridging its been proven to work for quite a few years now afaik litecoin was the first to demonstrate it
349393,connext works similarly to an atomic swap i think can someone correct me
349394,however you pass a message back and forth you still need to trust the bridge even if the bridge is an atomic swap there are ways to reduce needed trust but ultimately theres a lot of compromises to make in any case
349395,i am excited at the prospects that polkadot has to offer but i dont dare to make any judgment as the chain is still at its nascent stage we might see many attacks or stress test in the future when the chain starts to take off
349396,im not so sure thats true its been in production for a while the kusama canary network had over 200 referendums voted inout so far and polkadot is not far behind the tech works tokens are bridged things are pretty stable just needs users now
349397,yup they need a decent wallet and to improve the ux lots of talented teams building there and some really intriguing projects just a matter of time til it gains some good traction imo
349398,insert my chain just needs good wallet lots of talented teams building there and really great projects just a matter of time until it gains traction
349399,mustve seen 10 variations of that since 2018 at this point
349400,not sure how something that was essentially launched as a security with two private presale rounds and a 30 founder allocation could ever achieve sufficient decentralization but maybe im just to old school and times have changed fair launched leaderless networks that adhere to the original bitcoin ethos have become really scarce nowadays
349401,i always wondered is it correct to call interoperability crossshard communication even though shards are heterogeneous
349402,sure technically correct i would say
349403,talismanxyz but it is not a wallet problem it is a use case and marketing problem
349404,havent tried them can you expand on the use case problem some dope projects on there like efinity bit country oak network they all have some pretty unique and id argue valuable use cases
349405,for me the thing that bugs me is every app is deployed across both kusama and dot as a user thats a very jarring experience
349406,eh not so sure on efi but rest yeah use case problem is too many chains trying to find themselves due to lack of users and slowly converging on the same feature set which defeats the purpose very few revolutionary things are out and those suffer from a severe lack of marketing and so are under the radar in the rest of the ecosystem like for example dex as a chain as done by mangata makes sense because it gets rid of mev but then what else the appeal of eth is being able to use the dex as a lego but without evm there it is hard for the general public to utilize that dex then and moving tokens around is a friction of its own so all this is just very clumsy still plus devs need to start thinking aggressively async now
349407,kusama does try to help recreate reallife scenarios but the real stress test is when more users use the network it will introduce many badgood actors and more congestion created by different types of applicationsthe tech works only if everything is smooth all chains have this problem even in the early days of ethereum
349408,re apps on both kusama and polkadot only for some some are determined to launch only on the peoples chain others launch only on the vc chain so they get the most volume and tvl others use kusama as a launchpad for their polkadot project
349409,no doubt we broke kusama twice
349410,great take this its why when people complain about 100 parathreads i think its not that big a deal
349411,definitely the demand for slots is so low right now it is actually very cheap to get a parachain going
349412,and that is just because all chains seem to be defaulting to just adding evm and so you can do the same thing on all of them with a bit of chainlevel pizzaz for flavor it is cool that they can talk trustlessly but is it necessary not yet
349413,a really cool project is zeitgeist which is chain level optimized to be futarchy prediction markets this makes it a very interestin governance experiment too but this too unless it adds easy programmability is going to suffer from attrition as users lose interest and markets lay barren if augur could not pull it off how could a specific chain which requires bridging tokens in so sooner or later they will all converge into ethlike shards with a chainlevel optimization here and there and that is kinda discouraging so i hope they fix the marketing part the most because there is some super cool stuff there just hard to become aware of it
349414,havent seen that will definitely check it out
349415,the sushiswap docs say 005 fee reward for xsushi holders the remaining portion of the trade fee paid goes to a pool called sushibar the sushibar contract collects the fees from all the pools and when the reward distribution command is called it then sells all the fees turning them into sushi via sushiswapif i create two token mytoken and mytokentwo and then create a pair between them and execute a bunch of trades how can sushi sell the 005 to distribute to xsushi holders there is no ethmytoken or sushimytoken pair thus no route to sushi
349416,
349417,the fact that there is a ceo to offer out anything should be reason enough not to go there
349418,where do you guys get good yield on btcstable lps preferably on ethereum or bnb chain no aggregator simple lping
349419,here are some ideas to dig deeper
349420,those are not updated frequently and some of the yields will differ
349421,defilama also has a yield section these days
349422,any takes on how crypto and especially defi will bear no pun intended in rising interest rate markets
349423,for btc look at curve or badgerdao
349424,btcstable lpd together single stable or single btc mostly is rekt yield at least on the long run
349425,like btcusdc pairbest yield should be on curve trycrypto or univ3 gamma arrakis then i guess
349427,tricrypto at 15 pretty decent on fantom good native yield but il is quite punitive on curve tricrypto i believe
349429,
349430,just media being stupid hes a ceo of not polygon
349431,badly already started will only get worse rising interest rates did not lower inflation yet recession is here for 3 years minimum i advise to check this out to understand why almost all the assets banks and businesses are going down
349432,ellipsis on bnb has a btcrenbtc pool i think i saw ren tweet about it not too long ago
349433,still wondering who is the team behind ellipsis though not sure if it s a spinoff of curve themselves or if related to pancakeswap or binance
349434,have you guys checked this out
349435,curve arbitrum and avax were pretty good in the past days too
349436,is there any other protocol where you can leverage arb steth eth fully on chain
349437,instadapp lite does that
349438,u can probably lend but overcoll on aave and do that but wo leverage and smaller size probably
349443,this is just leveraged staking right you cant do the arb trade
349445,ya i guess theoretically if u put in more than u borrow you can do this on aave but defeats the purpose of leveraging up in this instance imo
349446,this is a sexy thread i am biased i think what is missing is the fact that composability goes beyond there meaning aave love aave allows you to arb internal rates of steth vs eth borrowinglending thats where the apy is coming from as well gearbox goes outside the system where your steth or eth go into lping into curve and then depositing into convex and then perhaps even more its not about a tool to just earn apy its about composability
349447,ya if u read whole 15 dumb tweets i say this this is only 1 integration imagine when u are combining multiple protocols this kind of leverage
349448,hey guys does anyone have any answer for this i cant find one and find it pretty weird
349449,it doesnt exist to my knowledge we do everything by hand for now
349450,even that d
349451,how could i see it by hand
349452,curios about this too i have an unfinished job that pull of the data required but lack of the arbitrary logic to simulate whatifs
349453,basically how could a user presumably vecrv whale decide between voting for a bribe with a given amount of vecrv or using it for the pool they are farming in
349454,btw if someone builds this ill give him a grant
349455,i guess is not such easy if you need to account for other players action
349456,well its going to depend on quite a lot of data
349457,ah yes sure assuming all else stays stable i mean at the last moment others can vote differently and change the gauge
349458,you have 43m crv distributed weekly and being directed by 390m voting vecrv so you have to look how much votes are given to your pool how hard you can boost it and then compare it vs bribes
349459,but bribes used to be at 150 apy until the terra shenanigans 5075 apy rn so bribes are much more lucrative than boosting if you are on stables on ethereum
349460,if you are on sidechains v2 pools the decision is more nuanced since yield are way higher which is when you should start thinking about using warden btw
349461,i havent seen any discussion about insurance platforms on which you allegedly could protect versus ust depeg did any of them work or is this forgotten in the whole scope
349462,what is warden my calculations are at the moment limited to curve eth mainchain though so generally how can i do all those calculations any tools any guides how did you come up with those apy numbers for example
349463,good question seems twap conditions havent been met yet
349464,warden is the dapp i am building a boost marketplace for curve most of these calculations are done by hand because i am an ape who couldnt find a platform doing it you can look at the boosted yield directly on the curve interface base tapr max tapr and look at the pricing if you dont have enough on our dapps simulation module for bribe prices we just take the previous rounds bribes and divide them by the number of votes they got this gives you a yield vecrv week that you just need to annualize small example frax paid 351000 fxs by dividing this with the number of votes they got you end up with 004 vecrv voting in their favor rounds being biweekly on convex thats 002 week or 104 year with crv at 143 thats 73 apr for bribers if it last for a year which it wont
349465,unslashed worked and will be processing claims once polcy thresholds are met which they will afaik
349466,oef how much marouaneh
349467,risk harbor worked unslashed processing claims insurace worked i think nexus no payouts
349468,1014k eth out of 22k eth apparently
349469,just reading their discord
349470,as a worst case scenario
349471,depends on how many people actually submit claims and then they need to process those claims too
349472,but i guess its bullish that insurance is working as intended even if its a tough break for capital providers
349473,its taking place here
349474,no its actually much lower
349475,based on pure estimates
349476,i just readmainbrain_ 05112022the spartan bucket shows it has around 22k eth the two ust buckets id estimate to have around 1014k eth of valid claims with the remaining being those who purchased during the depeg event invalid claimsi guess what u say is more accurate
349478,but in any case its cool to see insurance working as intended
349479,are you tuba
349480,no dat not tuba
349481,everybody know who is tuba
349482,which makes tuba tweets even more weird to read lol
349483,weak staying anon game lol
349484,somebody was mean and ratted em out at a conference i believe
349485,sad story
349486,amplice is tuba
349487,thanks you figue really appreciate italso where do you see bribes and stuff now i used to use curvote but its broken now kind of half works
349488,
349489,but there is nothing about curve bribes there i already checked this one there is one here but thats not as good as curvote used to be
349490,votium now offering bribes for vecrv holders as well convex has already move cvx bribes there
349491,pitch money us super competitive market
349492,yep
349493,maker is more like a pawnshop while frax is more like an onchain bank try it
349494,oh wow so waitthere is bribes for vecrv holdershere votium and more links to themalso for votium how does it workdiffer with the one i linked above you just vote at any of the pools there until midnight utc today and the incentives are paid out in cvx only
349495,i wish
349496,yep currently there is bribes for cvxeth cvxcrv and cvxfxs gauges bribes are cvx and for teth gauge bribes are in t token
349497,are there currently any decentralized fixed apy vaults for usdc im not aware
349498,notional
349499,thank you ill look into that i assume most of them have a maturity date
349500,yes but you can rollover loans to the new maturity period
349501,it would be great if someone was building a platform that indexes all those vaults its hard to keep track or maybe that already exists
349502,defilama is doing that now
349503,notional yield protocol
349504,yea i saw that idk how complete their list is tho and it wont let you interact with the various vaults directly the categorization isnt optimal either i was thinking of building it myself
349505,also element apwine pendle tempus swivel horizon sense 88mph barnbridge tranche ondo tho theyre more about yield tradinginterest rate swaps or tranching but mb fixed apy for usdc also can be found there
349506,confirming fixed rates is available on apwine easily through appapwinefifixedrates
349507,thanks bro
349508,are any of these actually keeping up with inflationsoutperforming lowrisk cefi options
349509,most of them dont to my knowledge
349510,there were so many startups whose strategy was to offer high yield opportunities to retail investors by just putting their funds into anchor i guess those projects are all dead rn
349511,yieldnotional say they can give u 68 apr didnt research about it guess its not riskfree at all also not sure if we can say lowrisk about cefi options

349533,does switzerland considers crypto intern as highly qualified worker
349534,i dont know for sure
349537,tax stuff maybe ok in kingdom here no legal fugazi basically nonnft holders need to pay 50 flat tax jk peace
349539,does anybody know any crypto lawyers by any chance im having an issue with insuraceio regarding them not wanting to pay out on a ust depeg policy for ust held with nexo for which the policy that clearly states that ust held with custodians is covered
349540,im not surprised river0x had earlier warned me than insuraceio for the most partnever pays the claim too much hidden clauses etc
349541,perfect ponzi cheffs kiss
349542,really is ill ask in his group to see if anybody has some attorney contacts its the only thing here i think that might save me
349543,isnt that how must insurance companies operate in general
349544,you would think we are working in this ecosystem to change the web2 incentives and user experiences finding profit or hedging in other ways not by not complying due to the small letter
349545,really depends on where a project is its lifecycle new ones might have innovative ideas and concepts but even in web3 itll eventually come down to how do we avoid impacting the bottom line as much as possibleinsurance is what it is for a reason and thats just human nature
349546,yeap but web3 insurance if aligned correctly and they get their bad reputation for not paying publicly then token utilization should must die off id expect
349547,other than that you got the daocommunity reputation core principles
349548,i think well see implementations of stability analysis in defi in the near future you can mathematically calculate the stabililty of deterministic systems so insurance should ultimately be far less guesswork
349549,hey everyone pm in the institutional defi space here recent events have made me desiring to help others be more attuned to able to understand and assess risks leading me to write an article on the framework i personally use to assess defi protocol risks from both a smart contracts and centralization perspective would love to know your perspectivesthoughts and to gauge opinions to see if theres anything im missing
349550,you can perform a stability analysis on mechanical dynamic systems since everything in here is just math it follows that youd be able to perform one on a protocol same as formal verification
349551,but if we can barely formal verificate the smart contract code how would you go about doing the stability analysis of a system you cant even correctly define the behaviour im out of depth here
349552,hmm this isnt quite right that they never pay the claim its just that at time that i wrote that they had not yet paid a claim out because from my understanding nothing they covered was exploited thats not to say they will pay out now the ball is in insuraces court lets hope they honour their word
349553,what happened to the other lobs chat anyone experienced with final cut pro here
349554,the kingdom it moved to nft gated u wanna have fun and alpha looool buy the ugly nft and join link pinned

349570,really cool stuff
349571,whats the difference between a full range v3 oracle and a generic v2 oracle
349572,reading through euler docs on oracle attacks is well recommended theres a price breakdown etc as to how much it costs and then it gives a risk grading system heres a prediction model of it you can play around with
349573,euler_mab probably is the best to answer hehe
349574,it sounds like
349575,a shit gifs are not allowed here
349576,theyre the same picture gif
349577,thanks for the share ser we built the new degenscore for onchain natives like most lobster folks here we dont care who you are what you look like anon or not your onchain activity is all that matters and your degenscore profile is there to makes sense of it dms are open for feedback questions and for teams that are interested in opening opportunities based on your onchain activity
349581,very interesting you could automate the choosing sorta like liquity does with their chainlink and tellor set up

349584,how can gitcoin even think of funding token projects

349588,gitcoin dao is a huge beast with many workgroups these are 2 pgf public goods funding fdd fraud detection preventiontbh i am not sure exactly what pgf does but fdd is responsible for sybil detection prevention weeding out cheating grants grant eligibility etc
349589,i think this whole situation popped up from brighid requesting to have their grant active even though they have a token since the token is low mcap and the entity applying for the grant is different than the development one that made the token or something
349593,the optimism collective is a largescale experiment in nonplutocratic governancestarts with an inherently plutocratic designy u do dis

349598,i actually had to completely restart last night i was running on a spot instance and i lost the instance and i had it set to auto delete
349599,perfect
349600,chainlink is a good solution we made a deep research about getting prices on chain and still use it as nonalternative way to get info
349601,i would say it has been resolved the moment private keys are not changeable sorry for the dumb comment but you cant sell a wallet
349602,
349603,but it resynced now in under 24hrs the 2 differences1 cache setting2 using ubuntu 20 instead of 22 which had an effect on the geth version i was using
349604,in ubuntu 22 i was using geth unstable the 2nd attempt i used ubuntu 20
349605,im not sure this made a difference though issue may well have been cache
349606,you can though with some trust eg otherdeed wl spots it was common to buy whitelisted wallets
349607,the majority were multiaccounts likely not wl bought wallets its insanely retarded to sell that way
349608,so the issue you are explaining doesnt exist imho
349609,otherwise id be happy to sell u any of my wallets lets go
349610,gib me you private key to check your reputation before the deal
349611,you can used to be talked about a lot
349612,but you pinky promise to burn the private key
349613,long range attack
349615,anyone has a fast solution for importing univ3 interface to contracts with latest solidity need twaps claculation they require version 080
349616,not following you could buy a private key as long as you trust the seller theres no issue you use the wallet do what you want with it and move on
349617,obviously there are risks involved depends what you know about the seller
349618,but not everything needs to be fully trustless
349619,reality is that if you trusted the sellers you got what you paid for and made good money on minting and selling the deeds
349620,also a great way to lose your funds but theres a place for it
349621,payoff simply needs to be worth more than the cost to buy or the cost a rounding error of what you have so its irrelevant if you get the rug pulled from under you
349623,isnt that essentially the netflix account sharing problem

349667,
349668,good take nourharidy were doing this for nft collections via a tcr to indicate dynamic rarity and are working on a separate thing sdk that would have guidance for game experiences built with it but how do you resolve the auditing bottleneck
349669,anyone knows if theres a place we can see rough estimates on how much has been raised on each chain over timeeg bsc has 50 projects raising a total of 300m polygon has 100m in total etc etc
349670,hello allwe developed a bot that can help you to search groups and channels in telegram and now its onlinethe bot1millions of groups and channels behind the bot2totally free for all3quick response no delay4smart search algorithmsstart the bot ensearchbot and youll find new in telegram
349671,there were other projects in the same category but with no funding who also appealed for example a centralised no token policy excludes any hyperstructure which is a huge space to explore for sustainable public goods any public good project using a token for governance any project that even looks like its building on defi mechanicsi think its important not to conflate has token with funded by token but the current policy just cuts out good public goods project on the first pass not even giving them a chance to participate on their own merit in the community votealso the dos argument applies both ways since the dosing happened when those projects appealed overwhelming discord but also finding their way through gitcoiners and backchanneling
349672,
349673,
349674,im a bit worried stuff like this will have negative consequences for the crypto market in general
349675,the damage is done now
349676,the blew up was too big
349678,yes correct sad and will likely spillover but we dont do legal fugazi here waiting for the parties involved to really show the consequences of the situation defaults bailouts etc
349679,will set a huge case ifin case he looses imo
349680,it likely wont work in korea since hes not a korean citizen anymore hes worth billions and one of the major donors to the current administration
349681,pathetic victim mentality poverty consciousness deserve all the rektage they get
349682,in profit amezin teamin loss fraud can i speak to managerwonder why they never sued to forcefully donate their profits
349683,what is the cheapest bridge lobsters are using to bridge back to mainnet
349685,other evmcompatible networks nothing fancy
349686,stargate seems more expensive than multichain or connext
349687,hop
349688,
349689,well done ivangbi
349690,use lifi its a bridge aggregator
349691,anyone need legal opinion on securityhowey testif you want a us cryptosavvy lawyer to write a legal opinion i can either introduce or help personally
349692,nice idea looks and works pretty beta on transfertoxyz
349693,i remember this leading to people looking at geist when it launched few months and 99 later though lol
349696,tbh i learned to come to peace w it because they were one of the first giving the lobsters get smth narrative so is oke
349697,how much is the value
349698,about 0
349700,nice airdrop
349701,2942
349702,i do have attorney contact for this kind of cryptocases
349703,058 weekly revenue while vested
349704,airdrops these days be like tbh graceful for any shekel
349705,another 696
349706,passive income
349707,you kinda always explain in detail what is boring there and only hint mysteriously that there is also some super cool stuff but you never mention what this super cool stuff is and why its super cool if you dont want to fill this chat too much maybe instead in lobster kingdom
349708,
349709,some kleros drama
349710,i dont see any stats or proofs
349711,rmrk docsrmrkapp is super cool but i dont want to shill my own stuff too much zeitgeist is potentially very cool moonbeam is very cool publicpressure is coming out with very cool music nft stuff and citizend a project launch platform as a dao which uses avatars with reputational nontransferable tokens equippable swag to represent performance and give access to future rounds based on that is also very interesting
349712,one second i had a list of accounts
349713,apparently nobody discussed lightspark this new thing david marcus exchief of libra is doing
349714,what are they doing exactly size of round not disclosed
349715,0x5e7b645d5bf86750cb1913122ba8a8545e2a9fd1 is the 1st account they staked 3m pnk into the technical court funded the two most recent appeals on case 1170 and has voted no in 2 rounds so far 0x930c54fd12bc507de14ce3967e715e6d9cd70ec4 this account staked 5m into the technical court 0x334f12afb7d8740868be04719639616533075234 this account staked 5m into the technical courtthere is a strong connection between 0x5e7b and 0x334f and a weak connection between 0x930c and 0x334f if these 3 accounts are all controlled by one person as it appears then this represents a 51 attack on the lower court they control 13m pnk out of 21m pnk staked
349716,details are vague but looks to be promoting further adoption of lightning network for bitcoin payments
349717,one of those accounts ran the kleros token sale all are clearly insidersteam members the team has refused to clarify citing privacy
349718,is paradigm a big investor in opensea
349719,this is one of the accounts putting 306 eth into unslashed giving them a direct financial incentive to vote against claims as they have been with 51 of the vote
349720,i should add this all to the thread i guess was discussed extensively in kleros tg
349721,thank you ser wasnt moonbeam just supposed to be a simple eth clone whats super cool about it
349722,is ethmontreal actually happening mid june
349724,nan
349725,nan
349726,yeah all the accounts are tightly linked to governance etc
349727,and each other
349728,nan
349729,from discord
349730,pretty interesting timing with potentially millions of ust related claims coming up
349731,if you could share it with me id be very appreciative
349732,
349733,senior partner is this one
349734,
349735,she looks perfect for this case thanks again
349736,please inform the office that i sent you to them ok
349737,would be my pleasure do you know which timezone theyre in
349738,utc 3
349739,eest
349740,they are based in cyprus
349741,typical cyprus namesurname btw
349742,indeed loool
349743,not sure most of lobs chat members cares much about this can u please continue that topic in a different chatdiscord
349744,is there a good thread that covers everything
349745,with the various addresses and how theyre linked
349746,maguracrypto retweeted __1 terra governance prop 1623 to rename the existing network terra classic luna classic lunc and rebirth a new terra blockchain luna luna is now live vote here
349747,ill add to this thread in a bit
349748,
349749,while not related to the claim i think it provides a better context for this as the funds come from a rug pull
349750,insert reverse uno card gif
349751,also avraham is missreferencing the situation as if ust claims are not being processed while its just its own usdn claim that is having issues due to conflict on policy
349752,is there any way to track historical balances for an eth address
349753,go to the analytics tab on the addresss etherscan page
349754,ty ser
349755,
349756,all written up
349757,not misrepresenting anything every statement there is directly backed up by on chain evidence
349758,its an undeniable fact that foundersdevs have staked about 60 of the court the unslashed claims are being held in while holding a significant financial stake in the outcome of those claims because they have money in the insurance pool
349760,no its not
349761,nan
349762,interesting im supposed to pay to read an anonymous complaint against me
349763,lmao
349764,feel like the trolls could maybe do better
349765,i am confused
349766,who is the scammer now
349767,nan
349768,ser please do due diligence
349769,i cant research brain too small
349770,well the scammer is asking for the insurance to be paid
349771,so basically avraham is the scammer but from a previous project fortressdao fusd
349772,the ohm fork on avax
349773,yeah
349774,he created a stablecoin that could be redeemed with 11 backing on stables but then started to accept the same stablecoin as backing and afterwards rugged everyone including the backing from fortressdao a ohm fork
349775,if u say that and thats why marouaneh and the affiliated are saving stuff it makes sense
349776,ok so we got a verdict any objections
349777,about to send flaccid penises to him
349778,i mean the claim can be discussed separately there are some in favour and against it due to the policy not being compliant with the waiting period he is a piece of shit for sure
349779,kind of confused whats being claimed and im not going to pay to read that document
349780,the claim is simple u rugged c source
349781,fort did a redemption in march and anyone who wanted was able to get backing out in usdc
349782,nothing was rugged
349783,two redemption contracts at and as it was in 2 parts lots of people chose to redeem
349784,sam nice idea for frax samkazemian
349785,i believe its in the works
349786,very soon with fraxlend about to be released we are going to be able to do native credit based loans overcollateralized cdps and protocoltodao loans all internally as well as isolated pairs for rwl both goldfinch lending amo and truefi has already passed governance for 200m total loan origination
349787,yes it is indeed in the works
349788,was a wild guess
349789,anyone have a dune query script to grab addresses for original yfi farmers original sushi farmers original yam farmers
349790,
349791,agree tbh do kwon scheming maybe under the force of someone idk but its hard to make people happy anyway he is just trying to make it live to not perish immediately for 10 generations
349792,terra doesnt have enough money for all the best way is making a new chain and build it again
349793,
349794,they keep calling this an attack but whos the attacker that implies an intention depegging rather than it just blowing up from a panic drive death spiral
349795,attack or no attack who cares you can only attack fragile systems and if its fragile its gonna fail at one point or another its pure cope and better to accept the result and move on
349796,do kwon sold ust for btc i think this is a reason big ust supply and big cashout led to the depeg event
349797,whats wrong with current chain besides luna price is security depend on a price of luna
349798,its pretty cheap to double spend isnt it
349800,btw the reservers that they had from fixing the ratio in curve pools dumping shit ust into usdc for example that they have managed to do for over 1b where is that i forgot what happened
349801,yeah it was gonna die anyway because it was a retarded design but i think attack makes a reasonable difference tbh that means someone intentionally brought it down which minimises their responsibility to some degree also means theres a substantial adversary out there
349802,yeah using their funny money to buy btc and flood the market with supply is the attack if anything
349803,usdn has the same mechanism with ust maybe the usdn depeg event was an experiment for attacking
349804,ivangbi its your
349805,but they understood that the network is not decentralized at all
349806,yes sasha closed the door and fighting
349807,wen usdd depeg
349808,never sir
349809,usdn was the ponzi that knew it was a ponzi
349810,but isnt usdn over collateralized
349811,no its way under
349812,sasha just rugging vires finance lenders
349813,it s a bit tricky imo for example these days i m upset that john paul koning is attacking my usdt bags is he riding the stablecoin fud wave or is this legit signalling of suspected fragility
349814,i was thinking nears usn my bad
349822,please no blabla bs or mutes
349826,sharing here so we can keep pretending we re the brainy chat of defi
349827,does anyone know of a open source app that uses private data and built dapp with it
349829,new learner want to understand how private data can be stored and used in blockchain
349830,it cant
349831,you can store some private data offchain and commit its hash to the chain so that whoever its shared with can verify its authenticity
349832,that was my other thought any implementation of this you know
349833,its all around us in minor forms for example i think ens does this but im not sure they do in v2
349834,zero knowledge proofs is what youre looking for
349835,in the past you used to be able to bid for a domain but not reveal your bid and after the auction ends you could reveal your bid to seal it
349836,okay i will check out ens library they built such a cool product tbh underappreciated
349837,curious has there been a project forking solidly on eth
349838,nope existing forks are on polygon bsc and optimism afaik i could miss some
349839,also no fork has been launched yet i think but polygon fork starting in the coming hours
349840,axial on avaxand dddx has been live for a hot minute
349841,there is evidenz which publishes degrees and other private data on the blockchain from what i understand no hash or offchain storage involved the institution that publishes the data passes some kind of kyc on its address the institution uses the evidenz dapp to encrypt the data and then store it on the chain with a tx then some shamir secret sharing shenanigans that i dont understand make it so that the owner of the data the student can control who can decrypt his data by sharingdeleting his key
349842,yeah no imo good forksdystopia tetu devs gud devbilidly gud changes on solidly and good twitteroptimism fork idk the name by deus team who smart good dev also
349843,railgun applies this to your wallet balance and eth transactions they become private and other people cant view them
349844,how is it different from tornado
349845,you can use any erc20 token and any amount like 7451 in one txand its still on eth layer 1 and so it can interact with smart contracts main differences
349846,does anybody know if theres a way to see exactly how much of each coin in a liquidity pair i was able to withdraw on a certain day
349847,oh interesting can you withdraw any amount too i know tornados nova supports arbitrary deposit but not withdrawal
349848,nova does both they just advise against it
349849,limited to 1 eth per tx because beta
349850,yes you can its very new though you can trade from a dex using your railgun balance but the first dex integration comes out next week
349851,you could store encrypted data onchain but you couldnt decrypt it onchain without revealing the private key so you would have to use offchain solutions like oracles to actually use that data and reupload the results or whatever there are privacyfocused chains though like the secret network that allow further elements of privacy built into onchain stuff but youre relying on the security of a tee if you expand the definition from blockchain to the wider decentralized system there are ways to store data like putting encrypted secrets on ipfsarweave there are also upcoming solutions using smpc with projects like nillion and zkp like aztec or starknets privacyfocused l3s
349852,cerenetwork basically ddc v2
349853,
349854,one step at a time very naisu
349859,its chris blec you could have stopped at hes mad
349860,not sure if youre joking or serious
349861,coinbase aside you have binance
349862,maybe im cynical but you are pretty naive if you think the average cryptonian wont gladly hand over all the necessary information to use fintech but with 100 more brockshane excuse me regulated defi
349863,as a professional large size defi trader or asset manager why would i doxx use an open address and let people game me and frontrun me for free
349864,privacy tools alpha keeping tools
349865,no legal fugazi will ban everyone
349867,its not that you are wrong its just about being boring and f annoying to discuss
349868,deleted
349870,yeah but is arbitrum a safe place to be hodling as far as i can tell there are vulnerabilities related to the sequencer and its still super centralized no
349871,yes there is no official count of validators
349872,so i was looking into bancorv3
349873,and their only audit is peckshield
349874,big yikes vibes
349875,had a chance to look at the new v3 contractslooking at bndai i find it strange the admin has mint permissions like what use case that can servealso the top admin is an eoa so that is no bueno
349876,
349877,for reals an eoa has mint permissions
349878,
349883,eoa fr wtf source please
349884,
349885,
349886,they have 3 more coming soon v3 still in beta i believe with just 4 tokens trading with a bunch of caps on
349887,whats everyone building
349888,aaltars in the gotchiverse
349889,user analytics for nft
349890,the only decentralized metaverse
349891,im interested
349892,nan
349895,send to cex withdraw from cex
349897,anyone want to chase down a scammer that took me for 2k all btc
349898,get outta here man that is like half a days worth of eth gas fees
349900,was it a bird
349901,at least you should go report it here twittercomaredbordstatus1526958211957391362
349902,and head here if your loss is small and you have enough free time and free nerves
349903,oh interesting their v3 post did not say much about audits etc thanks sven
349905,time value of money meets fnfts meets 4626
349906,
349907,
349908,anyone has a code snippet that shows how to protect against uncle blocks
349909,rly
349910,
349911,has anyone here experience in building smart contract runtimes if yes do you prefer one to wasm and if you do why
349912,cool the exchanges like gem are coming up with more and more of their own tools maybe u could collab withsell to them or like trait sniper provide links to buy on marketplaces and get a cut of the fees
349913,ohhh tell us more
349914,have a link its not shilling coz of bear market we are exchanging knowledge and problem solving with each other
349915,soontmbut basically were doing something similar to what elementswivelpendleapwine have all done but taking it a step further dropping the clunkiness of erc20 and applying a raristyle model to unique pools will allow interest claiming throughout the lifecycle for the strip holder along with giving couponstripping a real use in crypto beyond fixed interest rates
349916,whats the data source do you index yourself or fetch when the site loads didnt really work for me on mobile so i assume youre not storing tonnes of data either
349917,curious why you need this
349918,does trait sniper get fees who is providing affiliate fees atm
349919,why i actually came here is there a way to short nft tokens something like nftxor just regular nfts
349920,nan
349921,i just 50x leverage longed monkey drawings what am i in for
349923,funny coz i thought of that myself there should be a way to short the fungible tokens on nftx much better for price discovery and accurately pricing nfts
349924,anybody know anybody at francium on sol they havent updated their farm prices in hours ive tweeted about it with no response and i cant close my short now because the price is very very wrong
349925,trait sniper and others have free and paid tiers for members they have generous free tiers and provide direct links to buy on marketplaces so i assume they get paid affiliate commissions for the paid tier it is either subscription based or nfts as access passes or both are offered many are dropping governance tokens as well
349926,afaik no such platform for shorting exists
349927,hi lobsterz this is ur quarterly reminder that me and my friend mysticryuujin run archivenodeio a service where we basically run a handful of eth archivenodes loadbalance them and provide free access to anyone who wants it usually developers sometimes students whateverno strings attached we dont steal ur data we dont do shit we just give u free access cuz why not it costs us like nothing to run
349928,so feel free to get an api key if u could make use of it thanks
349929,real retroactive public goods in here unsung heroes
349931,do bsc avalanche have project incentive programs like polygon to attract launch on their chains
349932,bsc has mvb program since the beginningnot sure about avax
349933,theres avax rush
349935,yes it even recently launched a new funding program to encourage the use of subnetslike what jewel has doneinfo
349936,is there any spreadsheet type data on comparisons of different bridges
349937,or a list of them
349938,hello everyoneis it possible to borrow ust or luna for snapsahot somewhere now
349939,this one pretty old
349940,thanks just needed it in a pinch
349941,if the chain halts right after the snapshot then will you be able to return your ust and lunaprobably something worth considering
349942,so it is not possible
349943,possible but you might end up having to buy the luna and ust to repay your loans
349944,you can borrow luna and ust from ftx at 114 and 386 apy respectively
349945,dont think you can borrow luna from ftx
349946,youre right no wonder the rates are so low
349947,you can still borrow ust
349948,seems like it
349952,any good resources for understanding whats curve wars
349953,
349954,this one helped me a lot
349955,hey all noob question on etherscan you can view a list of holders of a particular token but you view a weighted list of participants in a single sided staking poolcontract
349956,not on etherscan natively either the protocol has it or it might be on a dune dash somewhere
349957,
349958,also a good bankless episod from back in january on that topic
349961,zk snarks themselves have nothing to do with ethereum they are a proof system that you can prove to someone that you know something without revealing any extra information of who or what that something can be
349962,what you are most probably looking for are zkrollups where zero knowledge proofs are used to construct a proof that a bunch of transactions that were executed offchain are actually valid
349963,tornado cash helps anonymize sends now and it uses zk
349965,firstmargincall please use google for really trivial stuff redacted the absolute low level the rest is ok
349966,ethereumorg inviting discussion about ifhow they should list stablecoins
349967,
349968,not a smol move lets see how much people care for it
349969,given sam has acquired 7 of robinhood interesting what he will do w that
349970,either that is related to the start of ftx us or he just wants personal riches control
349971,not speculating just giving ideas for what he could be doing so not spam
349972,did coindesk reporters infiltrate the block or wtf is this cheap shill dogetoshi
349973,how does that work
349975,ya i dont quite get the strategy shes talking about how does acquiring the us competitor help him more with his own copycat product
349976,this is clearly in reference to the robinhood stuff
349978,same question not like he bridged the two not like assets flow from one to another there
349980,gives him a stake in 3 stock trading venues iex rh ftx the stake in itself doesnt give ftx an advantage if he doesnt take a board seat
349984,but easily could mean mm partnerships across the 3 venues leveraging the infra its a similar play as to how ice consolidated exchanges before expanding internationally
349985,anyone know if there has been an audit of fpi specifically in the frax eco
349986,it looks like a pretty straightforward strategy to be honest anyone running a finance facing institution would likely be doing a similar thing with regards to expansion
349987,
349989,anyone knows if there is a log of all the signings a wallet does not necessarily about token approval but message signing ie loginregister in a platform
349990,a signature is an off chain thing if your wallet does not track them and if the app you are interested in does not show an activity or login log then no
349995,can lusd people buy some crv and fucking pump my yields please
349996,lets make a propose
349997,only down
349998,isnt it hard for them to do much active management since the protocol is so decentralized
349999,its basically untouchable right
350001,ser blz buy them and pump my yields its not acceptable i am getting 25
350002,we could try to but i think they are too decentralized for frax to acquire haha theres no way to acquire them its like trying to acquire ethereum
350003,still better than your bank you know where to enhance the yield though
350004,nan
350005,nan
350006,where are the 800m near lm rewards
350007,kakusaan will u rug
350008,why dis frog taking leverage positions
350009,u can trust pepe
350010,only on your yields principal safu currently moved to frax
350011,wait but frax givbs 6 on convex as is already
350012,does the frog need to eat or just the avg is taking a diff time in perspective to display apy
350013,nan
350014,just moved to frax yesterday
350015,basically try to enhance the 6
350016,of frax
350017,by leveraging it on perp and lyra
350018,display apr is due to no pool allocation for a week just trading
350019,
350020,thanks charlie for hijacking only shill i could do for brahma
350021,at this point the allo i have has reached the limit of shill you are allowed to do please top up or ban
350022,darrenlautf use this too we need to make daily ape feed you too
350023,nan
350024,please just wait 24h so our gauge incentives look higher
350025,weird fucking ending ngl
350026,guy definitely ruined his life now
350027,this piece lowkey praised him
350028,thats how it felt to me
350029,i guess they just dont make assumptions about whether hes guilty or not
350030,anyways hes on the run and i dont fancy his chances of not ending up in jail
350031,what was the court judgement tho if there was any they actually convicted
350032,he failed to appear in court and has a warrant out for his arrest
350033,hes actually on the run
350034,oh fak thank u
350035,i cant read such big blog posts
350037,yeah its a big one but a good one that flashloan is the most comprehensive explanation of any journalistic piece ive seen by defi native journalist or nondefi native pretty impressive article tbh thx for sharingshame the dude substantially complicated his life he definitely has the talent to make something great the dylan roof of balancer pools made me giggle
350039,he also moved frozen assets so i guess that means he has definitely broken the law
350040,contaigon spreads
350041,someone made a breakdown of the qanx exploit
350042,openzeppelin audit will be out soon
350043,failure to appear in court to face a jail sentence so yeah hes in deep shit even if found not guilty of the hack
350046,the owner of that contract is 0xec9596e0eb67228d61a12cfdb4b3608281f261b3 which is the poolcollection contract
350047,basically a kid hes 19 hes an adult according to the law and im sorry but at 19 you already know that you have to obey the law and that stealing is wrong
350049,uk right
350050,
350051,armchair legal talk livin on the edge ivan is gonna be so mad when he gets here you guys are in such deep trouble
350053,and that contract is controlled by an admin who is an eoa
350054,why u think that single sequencer is a centralization here its not a chain with validators its optimistic rollup so the security level of the l2 is relaying on eth consensus basically eth is a source of tx merkle roots for l2 or im missing something here have more experience with op not arbitrum
350055,well if sequencer stops processing transactions you are kinda rekt right or if there is some bug on the fault proof implementation
350056,im no expert in l2s tho
350057,kinda in that you have to post your txes straight to mainnet
350058,and im not sure if there are any userfriendly tools available for that rn
350059,id guess you need to post the tx as if you were the sequencer right compressed and stuff
350060,yeah probably there is tooling missing
350061,would be interesting some chaos testing or chaos proof of withdrawals on l2s could help a lot proving security of having funds on l2
350062,any actual us lawyers here who can comment on this just want to get an understanding of whether this can have consequences or if its just some irrelevant lower court decision
350063,hello actual us lawyer here
350064,sirs does anyone know when is gr14 scheduled its there like a tentative date maybe
350065,yes
350066,june 8th
350067,really interestingly coincides with this
350068,thanks
350069,nan
350070,nan
350071,long story short this is big
350072,i have not had time to read the entire judgement yet but that one page in the screenshot is the most important page for me
350073,i guess ivan is going to kill this convo soon so i have to ask before it what does that all mean
350074,roughly the court said that the sec arent allowed to define enforcement or adjudication rules and they cant take any action unless theres a clear directive passed by congress
350075,
350076,hashed made a round trip of 35b it seems
350077,its going to get appealed to the supreme court
350078,im not armchair legal im i passed the bar exam legal
350080,dont say that unless you know
350081,so now on congress needs to give directive to sec on each of the cases
350082,do you see a world in which this doesnt get appealed
350083,i am not from us so i dont quite understand the legal implications
350084,no thats not what it says feel free to read the judgement
350085,the sec cannot make judgement against a accused unless there is intelligible principles from congress so understandable direction by the elected representativesthis is exactly what coinbase were saying regarding their lend product dont shut us down if you dont have clear laws about this industry
350086,no way jfc no way woooow
350087,ok thanks for the clarification legal language is difficult for a nonnative us legal framework is difficult to understand but i think i got the gist of it
350088,guys i wrote bullshit again for founders probably a bit for plebs who idolize or hate vcs either of the extremes
350089,i cannot relate to this everyone is saying people are throwing money at them even in this bear and yet i have to pitch pretty hard for this new thing we are doing i do not get the fabled i have to turn vcs away thing that is not to say we are accepting every offer but still def not how do i filter muh vc offers
350090,same here do you have a token bruno i suppose investors hunt for token projects
350091,we do this new venture will have one in a year or so so it will be some time before they dumpflipwhatever but still not experiencing this
350092,also not having a breeze with money per se not hard but its not a shower i dont think anybody has money throwing at them that is a few weeks past that or maybe they are talking of random anon emails offering them 2m every day lmao
350093,also i didnt say it is showering tho
350094,i have a noob question regarding raises when it comes to a web3 project if there is no token or equity share what other terms can one offer to vcs
350095,project in question has future revenue streams
350096,that means u r likely a public good
350097,what this new thing about
350098,kinda yeah but there will be revenue streams from the service
350099,future revenue streams then it can either have token or equity not seeing the problem then it just depends on when and how you do it
350100,maybe a if you give us 100k well give you 200k in a year or something
350101,thats a loan structure pretty scary to make one as a founder early on
350102,why wouldnt you give them equity then thats sort of the point of equity
350103,theres no equity to give with the understanding i personally have for equity no tokens an nft and its a dao
350104,what is the dao constructed of
350105,i mean u vote right nfts tokens
350106,yeah this is why ive bootstrapped with personal funds but thatss only a short term solution
350107,if only there were a token standard you could use to replicate equity on the blockchain
350108,yeah a 999 supply nft is the governance token
350109,well u sell that then
350110,
350111,an sdk for gamelike experiences that deploys them to any chain and for any existing metaverse or a new one and a token economy around it and its guilds and daos that provide a service
350112,that is perfect it is how we did the first raise
350113,lol i have definitely spent many months mulling the decision over to launch a token but from my experience a token skews incentives in the community at least in the beginning
350114,well likely do one in 6months or so once the product is actually good
350115,nfts are fine and very nice in the regulatory aspect
350116,i recommend raising with nfts to represent equity is pretty cool
350117,ye doesnt seem like an issuesell the bloody jpegs w voting rights and maybe go to jail like we all door hope we dont and wagmi
350118,i suppose it would be to approach a vc and ask them to buy into the nft seems like nonvc territory
350119,wagmi sall good
350120,well you dont pitch them an nft you pitch them equity represented by it it is pretty novel and could have legs imo and as long as your team stays anon sec will not assassinate you
350122,michael we are not supposed to use the words equity and token in the same sentence blz i like u lets not go to jail
350124,nan
350125,yez
350126,nontransferable is good plus there is this added idea of adding request for transfer into the contract such that if someone requests a move of a token to address x if 65 or so of the other voters support it the move can go through is kind of like social recovery of nontransferables in case of wallet losses etc
350127,youre right i think ive got a lot of thinking to do regarding a tokenraise the issue is that we want to be a disruptive public good with some additional pro features to allow the nft holders some advantages the actual utility of the token is another question altogether and doesnt really fit the model but well see side question i assume bears are not good for launching tokens
350128,lol im non anon ahhh
350129,eulerdao launching next month perfect time to launch
350130,nan
350131,hugs
350132,
350133,sounds similar to nucypher i think theyre now named keanu after merging with another project
350134,so this would basically shift the burden of proof more towards the sec again as opposed to now where they can just say they dont like something and then put pressure on the other partythis is highly interesting to me looks like the crypto bubble has not picked up on this ruling yet it seems to be treated more of a conservative vs liberal partisan issue on twitter for now
350135,
350136,wtf
350137,it didnt work for wirex what makes revolut think it will work for them
350138,they are bigger to start with
350139,they should have started with changing those maybe
350140,
350141,the consolidated groups consolidated assets exceed its consolidated liabilities
350142,actually an ideal use case for revest we allow you to lock tokens into nfts which can then be transferred or not can turn that off too without impacting the price of the underlying asset just coming off significant system upgrades and two additional audits would be happy to share more if you want to shoot over a dm
350143,and no now isnt a good time to launch from what my advisors are telling me at least wait 36 months for things to cool down if you have productmarket fit and revenue streams youll be fine if you need runway now is really the worst possible time to be seeking money
350144,does anyone have recommendations for a dev shop that specialises in web 3 front ends
350145,
350146,sounds similar but way less user friendly you pay the network to read the data
350147,the question of who is the carrier of the payment burden is diff nucypher is legit cool tech
350148,anyone want to take a stab at this poll you can yield farm eul with up to 20x leverage on euler but when you recursively borrow what are your liquidation risks interesting answers so far
350149,dont recursively borrow 185 times because it doesnt help idk
350150,magicpoweredio
350151,well it does help you farm eul tokens youre borrowing power is 185 times higher than it would be eg deposit 1k mint 185kyou now have a position worth 195k deposits and 185k debt if you had simply deposited and borrowed you might be able to borrow only 800 so youve increased your yield farming capacity like a boss by using an efficient form of recursive borrowing this is how the pros do it on compound with smart contracts and flash loans but on euler anyone can do it in a single lowcast tx from the ui on any asset with an eul distribution
350152,yeah we work with these guys and theyre frankly incredible nothing but the highest praise
350153,what i mean is that its a nonexistent case where such a thing is alive for a long time such bit folded leverage so its not even practical for users imho but ye if we are mentally playing with numbers sure
350154,feel like this is qi and when i say the obvious answer of like 9 months the sirens are gonna go off
350155,also not true you build a leveraged longshort position on correlated assets in much the same way consider the folding strategy on ethsteth deposit 1k stethmint 5k eth swap 5k eth for stethyou now have a leveraged long on steth and short on eth the price movement is less of an issue notwishtanding recent events but you should still be concerned about time to liquidation because of the cost of borrowing
350156,same is true for any assets that are correlated in price stable coin lendingborrowing forex derivatives etc
350157,yeye ofc folding on correlated assets can be higher tagging apeir99n oxmikko we doing a different approach with gearbox where you dont fold internally in the system but your yield comes from outside
350158,what i like about the question is that ive had a few people message me saying obviously its x and x has been different every time
350159,lending protocols dont have it as their strength to do leveraged positions cause their yield is endogenous if there is more composability yield is sourced outside
350160,prob less than the 9m due to liquidation penaltybuffer
350161,answer is prob less than 6
350162,can you give an example of a folding strategy that makes use of exogenous yield in a more efficient way
350163,sure lets take you exampledeposit 1k stethmint 5k eth swap 5k eth for stethand then 2 more actionsaddliquidity on curve pool steth stecrvaddliquidity and stake on covex stecrv into staked convex position
350164,but is that more efficient or just more leverage in your example you are now effectively using a staked convex position as collateral for an eth short your risk is much higher since youre dealing with more protocols and more leverage
350165,kinda too but if you do not add risk even if small who is your yield then
350166,the liquidation conditions are much less clear too i would argue the derivatives made out of derivatives are much less liquid its more costly to close positions and so on
350167,almost all yield in defi comes from people paying a premium to either swap or build a leveraged position
350168,its not the case convex allows to unwrap position wo any extra conditions so it doesnt add more complexity it just adds small gas overhead
350169,euler_mab how you evaluate risks for 2 following events1 unwrap convex position into curve pool token2 remove liquidity from curve stecrv pool
350170,its more efficient if the collateral you need to put in on the first step is less than u would for other kinds of on chain borrowing
350171,put 1 eth to borrow 4 eth is more efficient than putting 4 eth to borrow 4 eth
350172,i still dont understand how oracles rating for euler are calculated and why wsteth pool costs of manipulation is 2 times bigger than usdc pool while having 60 times less liquidity sorry probably stupid
350173,
350174,this is pretty cool still also puzzled how that works i guess the uniqueness of v3 but cool stuff
350175,total liquidity isnt really relevant its all about how widely distributed the liquidity is if i want to manipulate a twap i need to send the spot price in a single block to something millions of higher or send the price to zero so imagine an order book for usdcusdt with 1m buy and sells placed at 099 and 101 above and below the 1 peg i can swap 1m usdc for 990k usdt and ive lost a small bit of money in slippage but every 1 more i swap sends the price straight to zero the order book is empty so the cost of manipulating this oracle is 10know imagine an order book with 1m buy orders spread evenly at 001 002 003 and so on same liquidity different order book profile now when i swap 1m usdc for usdt im actually paying a huge amount of slippage its going to totally rekt me moreover arbitrageurs can use the wide range liquidity to arb the price back up immediately so the slippage cost is higher and the arbitrage risk is greater when liquidity is fullrange than concentrated how do we measure the actual cost of attack right now we can use the current liquidity profile of the uniswap pool and simulate swaps by using static calls to the smart contracts to figure out how much it would cost for an attacker to move the twap price by 20 in a lot of cases it turns out this costs billions of dollars
350176,flashbots cli was just released

350192,does someone have the conference program so we can confirm if thats true
350194,the guy kinda runs the thing so if anyone is to know itd be him
350196,trying to verify not trust here ser
350197,hehe i suppose that makes sense
350199,to be honest most crypto conferences are soul crushing nft nyc last year wasnt about people getting together to talk about how nfts can bring utility and community it was tens of thousands of people shilling and trying to find the next getrichquick project while everyone gets into crypto for a different reason the only conversations i enjoyed happened in events outside the conference
350200,there was a guy in a gorilla suit trying to sell a toilet for 1m
350201,that was actually the high point of the conference d
350202,that reminds me my only memorable experience from a crypto conf was running into cz at the marina bay sands toilet in singapore i honestly dont remember anything else from 6 yrs of conf going most are overrated and often serve other purposes marketing a launch meetin ppl in the area etc etc
350203,how bad did his shit smell
350204,worse than his luna position
350205,most of eth conferences are awesome you just dont need to go to dubai singapore miami and other fancy places to meet communityminded people go to denver amsterdam barcelona ethcc and you will be amazed imo
350206,didnt even consider that tbh eth conf are defo top tier
350208,dont forget devcon bogota
350209,that would definitely be on top of my list
350210,any country where i can eat fried cheese with my hot chocolate is aces in my book
350212,susd has same model as dai does cdp collateralized based positionits collateralized overcollateralized stablecoin which means that if collateral is going down too much there are liquidations happening to maintain the stablecoin supply and peghere i can see stablecoins trilemma and mim susd and dai has similar design much more robust to the market drops than ust
350213,afaik susd main and original collateral is snx i also heard they have eth as collateral as well
350214,i think they added eth but the snx governance system i think does have the power to allow other tokens as collateral
350217,deficonnycdeficon is a charity conference
350218,sec cant confirm if video of bill hinman is actually bill hinman in ripple case after reasonable inquiry the information known and currently available is not sufficient to enable the commission to admit or deny this request the sec stated in court documents
350219,hello somebody told me that this may be interesting for people in the groupsome people took advantage of the 4pool imbalance created by synapse bridge removing the liquidity of the ust and there was a lot of wrong trades happening in arbitrum and optimism curvethis is one of those tx
350220,interesting but not unusual normally trading bots should identify such liquidity removal events and place their arbitrage transaction to make atomic swaps however it seems like curve is the only ust liquidity pool on arbi which means arbitrageur must hold ust token before synapse removes liquidity and they can then sell ust after the removal to make a profit thus no bot was able to take this opportunity and those transactions are likely submitted by traders interacting with the web ui
350221,yes and i was able to find that all the ust was minted just before sending in my opinion if the liquidity was from synapse bridge as i can imagine then it was a bad move from them against all the users that trusted the wrapped token
350222,what are popular decentralized version of mediumcom
350223,mirrorxyz
350224,thanks i have been searching mirror on google and it was hard af to find this
350225,np
350226,they should work on seo optimization i have typed many keywords mirror
350227,i have kind of a technical question but its coming from a non dev guy ive heard a lot of people talking about security in defi and sometimes arguing about solidity being the problem ive also read that some programming language are more secure than others especially for finance so theres my question is solidity inherently insecure or am i jumping to conclusions here thanks sers
350228,from a devs point of view i dont think the defi insecurities are inherent to any programming language the entire crypto or defi market is still in the early stage and thats why there could be all kinds of vulnerabilities
350229,some languages are easier to derive guarantees forbut this often comes at the cost of expressiveness and ease to write so we dont see them as ofteni think solidity as a language is okay but the ethereum virtual machine does have some quirks that can be tricky for an unfamiliar dev
350230,anyone know any good places to get some test erc20s on kovan
350231,maybe try chainlink
350232,nice thanks
350234,found it
350235,could someone make a site where a scammer needs to connect their wallet and pay a gas fee to reveal imaginary seed phrase then i could just direct all those dm scammers to this site and tell them that this is a new way to securely show my seed to them lets_scam_the_hell_out_of_scammers
350236,bear market sucks was in hackathon and got rugged because terra went under months of work and hope of funding went poof
350239,fact this project is even in bed with geist shows its a scam as well
350240,wait you mean lobsterdao is a scam
350241,how many influencers were in the seed round
350242,420
350243,
350244,at 69 eth per lob they are sitting at a huge loss
350245,dear lurkers and german people for clarification i am joking there was no seed price or sale
350246,
350247,theres no way to short any erc20 tokenanyone know the reason for this
350248,nice but how does it cost you 0 to run
350249,hey has anyone have experience using omnia protocol it provides extra privacy to mm is it safe any side effects thanks in advance
350250,like nothing 0
350251,check old bzrx
350252,theyve been hacked like 4 times already old bzrx
350255,moneys gone anyway
350256,in order to make a short you need to be able to borrow that token and sell itborrowing requires 2 things liquidity provider for lending of asset oracle to reliably monitor priceboth are tricky in case of any erc20 token
350257,hardware paid off because of gitcoin leaving internet bill and electricity costs which is pocket change any further costs use leftover funds raised from gitcoin
350258,good morning guys who is in davos for wefwe have lunch with dao and generally beautiful defi day on 23 may come over join the lunch text me if aroundbestalenaemtechinvestcom
350259,is omnia live
350260,you can test it here
350261,yeah just came across weird i remember researching flashbots competitors a few days back and came to the conclusion that omnia protocol isnt live yet
350262,you can short on euler theres a button on the quick action tab that allows you to do this there are still only 60 markets but anyone can create a new market any time
350263,synapse doesnt route bridging trades through this pool nor does it provide liquidity here the only thing synapse is enabling with ust on arbitrum is bridging it fromto terra and a few other evm chains
350264,out of curiosity why were you looking for one
350265,seems like you have some great insights to share
350266,huh
350267,if that was decided at the general shareholder meeting then surely there are some records stating motivation its hardly a conspiracy if its this obvious
350268,its not in bed at all we just got the
350269,just moving jurisdictions or entities this was yellow press bullshit right when the thing started meh
350271,interesting
350272,not interesting they said they did loantomms structure and mms have balances all around the exchanges and other wallets op is uninformed
350273,binance completes optimism network integration and opens layer 2 eth deposits
350274,oh damn
350275,whats lobsterdao have to do with geist
350276,nothing when they launched they promised some coins to the community that way they got the attention so it was a marketing move for them i assume some members looked into them as a result but then they never gave the coins up until now thats all cute that they remembered it though
350277,what do you have to do with geist
350278,well geist is another soft rug from the company called civitas if you look at their website the five projects theyve created all soft rugged
350279,i assume a few projects on there were launched as forks that sounds probable dont know what how many and by who though
350280,if you get forks appearing on a chain in a matter of minutes when andre got the hype its probably they are not seasonal builders maybe they become but the risk of them being just to farm is higher again not sure if that is the case just performing mental masturbation
350281,whole fantom kinda soft rugged didnt it btw has there ever been a major design ideaprotocol that originated on another chain eg was not deployed on ethereum first
350282,well its just assumed anything like a side project is also a rug lobsterdao likely
350283,lobsterdao is not a project you moron
350284,ok you seem to be annoying fk off
350285,we were replying in a nice waytrying to help and explain
350286,nan
350287,piece of stupid shit asshole
350288,solidly
350290,i read today that eth 20 with pos is coming soon and i have a question what is stopping alameda for example from bringing back a lot of nodes and compromising the network they have about 116m in eth in their public portfolio
350291,the network can handle 300k validators 116m in eth is under 2000 validators hardly a threat even at that level
350292,theres alrdy 8b staked with lido for example
350293,
350294,oh no blz no
350295,rekt by forex again
350296,finally eur had almost gotten to parity with the
350297,any idea why this drop
350298,wait did eur go up or down i cant quite tell from the tweet cause it says usd
350299,eur went up 15 against usd over the past 5 daysif you have a wider look eur is going down heavily over the past quarter and year 13 over a year from 120 to 105
350300,this is too hard i quit
350301,sometimes i dream of selling it all and being a wolt deliverer just spend days idling on a bike from destination to destination mini quests that mean nothing financially never to look at charts again
350302,yes this running a company in europe with eur and paying lots of stuff in usd we have felt this drop very very strongly
350303,youd still have a black swan risk though instead of being usdt depegging it will be you crushed by a drunk driver on your beautiful bike
350304,that is fine at least i wasnt watching it come at me
350305,damn that is dark
350306,ooof
350307,insert cityofangelsgif
350308,it has some nice features of crowdfudning there were a good presale i participated few months ago
350309,i dont think its gonna stop europe is paying a heavy toll on its energy imports while us are benefiting from the gas and petrol prices being so high i think us and canada need a barel price over 60 to be profitable we are way over that us always manage to benefit from economic crisis as half their money load is held abroad which dilutes the costs for its citizens this is not the case at all in europe
350310,ah ok thanks i thought you were looking for features we are doing some market research about the lack of appeal of subsocial as a medium alternative
350311,yes i am afraid you are right
350312,fair but like 40 of the total circulation of usd has been printed in the past 2 years which is contributing to the dollars decline
350313,it all went to shit when the gold standard was abandoned really
350316,if your salary is in usd and you live in the eu its pretty nice though real salary steady climbing without a raise
350317,nan
350318,creative time
350319,what would you do to remain fair honest in this case
350320,easy one distribute treasury to holders close up the shop
350321,however that leads to absolute realized losses to holders meaning they dgaf if 100 dollars is distributed
350322,they would rather get 0 and keep the shitcoin alive for a small chance of recovery than get 100 bucksand if you exit and do it fair they will actually call you a rugger even if you distributed all the funds
350323,correct but exactly the same happened in europe in term of printing main difference is the money printed benefited us citizensentities 100 but they hold only half the usd in circulation because many other countries are using usd as their legal currency usd is a reserve currency its still from far the main currency for international exchanges which means they will be less impacted by inflationwhereas european hold 100 of the euros so full impact therethats why us always get less impacted during global crisis
350324,as long as your salary is indexed on inflation
350325,this macro jumbo is really fugazi lets please not continue
350326,if you dont have a pmf you should look for it if you are still motivated find the edge otherwise yeah just drawing out the pain
350327,yes you need to buy a lobs and join lobsterdao kingdom for macro discussion we predicted the dotcom bubble and the 2008 crash there infinite alpha awaits you
350328,frax is owning curve now
350329,but getting measly 57 apr for all that voting power
350333,same thing on convex maybe infura stuff give it a couple hours i guess
350335,idk if this wasnt clear
350336,that is a very interesting question many doxed founders are jailed for life by their projects this way
350337,coingecko is down
350338,yeah im also having some issues
350341,nan
350342,darren exit scammed
350343,3 day long hangover must have been a hell of a party
350344,where iz that lobsterdao kingdom
350345,they have over 1bn in the pool
350346,
350347,time to buy a lobster nft
350348,
350349,is this wechat direction or not per se
350350,curious what this could apply to
350351,how could a business possibly assume any sovereignty over their data if they use whatsapp for official purposes
350352,more spam on whatsapp thats allthis api doesnt allow one to create bots like telegram or discord per se for example whatsapp bots cannot join a group
350353,its messier than that these apis have been available for plenty of years now as an onpremise services cpaas companies like twilio host them and offer them as value added servicesthe arch looks like this so all of your communication is visible to the org hosting business api client
350354,could you still host the api yourself onprem still an ugly solution though
350355,no you need to work with whatsapp business solution providers its a list of companies that whatsapp has allowed to host the api client
350356,disappointing i have no need to use whatsapp but im getting pretty sick of nearly every app provider forcing customers to the cloud
350357,microsoft finally saw the light with skype it was meant to be dead by now in place of teams which is azure only but they back tracked after most govt agencies complained
350358,whats with that
350359,why does everything seem to push towards cloud storage now lol
350360,like basically everything
350361,online subscriptions consistent revenue
350362,lobster does someone has link on youtube permissionless day 12
350366,dataminingmoney
350368,
350369,thanks for sharing looks like fundametals would go very well with practical basic knowlage such as ive interviewed close to 50 solidity developes still cant wrap head around how little an avarage smartcontract dev knows about standard smartcontacts gotchas
350370,has anyone got a checklist for a successful token launch
350371,what does successful mean here
350372,examples of such basic questions your average sc dev could not answer
350373,i think if u are a buidler u start to build something newpivoooooot and when u eventually have a token u keep those bagholders in mind and airdrop them sth thats probably the best you can do
350374,think if u honestly say like this idea i thought would work but didnt work sorry guys will try to build something else now will keep u in mindsensible ppl will ok of course if u shilled ur coin as uponly then ppl will be pissed but then thats on u too like do kwon
350375,maybe dont raise at bazillion valuation at peak bulla market with no pmf and then rush to tokenise
350377,yea if you were too greedy then ppl will be rightfully pissed
350378,i think a good example is like weiward
350379,problem with this sort of thinking is it confuses token holders for users
350380,in lots of cases token holders are users because thats how they got the token but i take ur point
350381,these guys tried to build something cool model didnt quite work there wasnt a token though some ppl got minirekt by the mechanism design they were like it doesnt work sorry move on
350382,is that true afaik most times they get the token without ever using anything
350383,depends on the project
350384,and then complain there are no users always a fun one
350385,transfer vs safetransfer reentrancy attack got to hear erc20 reentrancy bs too often constants take slots into storage call vs delegate call require vs assert are private variables are private a few weeks ago ive learn from senior solidity 190ky about race condition during transaction execution etc etc
350386,i suppose there are more exceptions today with the retroactive airdrop fad but i wonder how much of an exception it is maybe its controversial but arguably more than half of the token holders by usage in those are only there because they expect to dump it within the first hour to 30 days and move on to the next thing to sybil
350387,this is true but even in web2 plenty of companies have loads of users who wouldnt be users without subsidies
350388,tokens are just a more direct way of giving out free money lol i guess good projects that find pmf will get sticky users and no pmf u will be rekt when tokens stop working
350389,should compile this into a medium post interesting stuff angle
350390,this is not controversial this is the truth just very few people in our field want to even acknowledge preferring instead to keep on babbling about community wagmi etc
350391,any giga brain in here that can put this in digestable format
350392,team allocations investors
350393,all token unlocks
350394,artcle about my frustrating experience these interview went comparativly ok actually i already filter out some ppl and devsshop who with serious faces told me they created metamask and enjin blockchain not just completely finihsing nonames but 100ppl verified devshop on upwork
350395,what did you want to know about it specifically
350396,common meme was that there were no more unlock on the red coin but investors and team have more to receive looking to quantify
350397,this apparently is open to interpretation
350398,i mean blz educate our devs so i get rugged a lil bit less 3
350399,yikes its not alot of the tokens unlick aroun ablot 1416 m its on 14 m now
350400,dm
350401,an erc20 can have callbacks its the standard not a fixed list of known tokens so reentrancy should be in fact considered by any project that deals with an arbitrary token
350402,i think this is really one of the big fields of study in web3 incentives engineering
350403,how do you design tokenomics to incentivize right behaviors
350404,airdrops particularly badly engineered one are an aweful way of engaging a community
350405,we just launched a product and i spent more time dealing with people who wanted to get the airdrop but were unlikely to ever add value to the project
350406,i did find some projects that map eligibility to past behavior which still by no ways perfect is an interesting framework
350407,the future of behavioral economics
350408,that is true but you almost never give users shares and all that that entails as subsidy and for good reason id sayto be clear i have no problems with tokens ideally users and tokenholders would overlap almost entirely as is the case with network tokens but if youre having a problem with fit in one project that has a bunch of token holders but few users and youre working on a new one it would be wise to consider asking yourself what those tokenholders broughtwill bring to the table before giving them tokens again lest you repeat history
350409,5k tokenholders with 50 users is just a lot of entitled noise and future wen news admen waiting to happen
350410,wen airdrop wen moon
350411,wen marketing is a favorite
350412,hey lobsterrrrs any gnosis safe devs or does anyone know if there is ui support for testnets optmism kovan polygon mumbai
350413,there is nothing more demoralizing and frustrating to a team in build mode then answer these fucking questions
350414,i actually had a bunch of people directly asking how they can make money of the project d
350415,yeah i have experience in that department
350416,
350417,
350418,any admin where can i send proposal
350419,kindly
350420,for flashloans do you have to return the loan within the same transaction or same block
350421,same transaction
350422,hmm so you cant use it for sandwich attacks
350423,damn then this is one rich sandwichoor
350424,yes you can
350425,how will it work if you have to repay it within the same transaction
350426,a cowswap relayer can operate a mev extractor
350427,so the relayer itself will do the attack isnt there any protection against that on cowswap
350428,appsubsocialnetwork
350429,yes undoubtedly true my thing is if u want to make good with the token holders to be seen as a rugger
350430,not really the only limit is their inclusion of relayers into the network
350431,if u want to just say were closed you are of course to free to do that too
350432,which is a permissioned process
350433,so unless you are doing the arb of the century there is no real incentive to attack as a relayer
350434,
350435,wow real size
350436,fuuuuuuuuu
350437,lmao the bug was them not calling init after deploying a proxy contract imagine getting 10m for that
350438,looks like they already fixed this prior then did it again
350439,timing is everything in life
350440,looking at the tx they didnt use 145m but much less they swapped usdc to dai but then were able to convert back with maker psm so they could repay the flashloan
350441,literally 3 weeks after the hack
350442,thats commitment
350443,
350444,
350445,i guess this will challenge the definition of a dao more than anything if enough of the token holders think this is a good idea surely this is all part of the big experiment or is this i like decentralised autonomy until they come after my bags
350446,if the thread on the forum is true arent they just getting rid of a ahem leech that for all intents and purposes reneged first
350447,thats exactly that
350448,yes
350451,
350452,interesting seems like active mc people saying i am all wrong
350453,because you are wrong yeah
350454,i am wrong with my arguments it seems happy to accept that still dont think its wrong to be against any such seizures
350455,since we are on the topic of counting others money
350456,
350457,its not a dao if we cant decide based on facts
350458,nan
350459,it doesnt matter what you are you cant take someones money
350460,be it a dao my mom or whatever else cause one day they will come after you the same way
350461,we are not taking anyones money we support value add vcs
350462,there is a lot of spending on legal stuff and marketing stuff
350463,ser this is mental gymnastics you are taking gabbys money i have never even been a fan of ygg lol creating spinoffs to make more but u r robbing
350464,you i mean u know just as a general term
350465,strategic happiness lmao
350466,congratulations your money has been deleted for having wrong thoughts social credit 99lol more seriously yeah it would be better to do this beforehand rather than after maybe even encode whatever you think qualifies and can be quantified as value add into the token itself fewer disappointments and buts down the line
350467,
350468,as a precedent doesnt look cool at all as an idea for the saft design is beautiful
350470,as an idea for saft design good luck with having 0 money this way or rather have the 100 cap full and them all voting to not cut each other
350471,1 founder has taken too many vacations burn tokens2 contributor didnt show up on one call burn tokens3 investor sold too many burn their tokensand as soon as current mob makes in a year the new mob will make the same proposals to burn their wealth glhf
350472,i stand by this
350473,this is mob shit and will get 0 working members
350474,cause in a month someone else will try to fuck somebody else
350475,anyway done thing bored moving on
350476,
350477,same
350478,is anyone involved with eth introducing wasm to the ecosystem
350479,beautiful doesnt mean reasonable
350480,anyone have rinkeby eth to spare
350481,man pinita sucks for big files anyone have a solution
350482,how much you need
350483,anything between 1 and 90 eth looking for 90 in total
350484,only have 5
350485,lol
350486,faucets are dry
350487,how do they runout of testnet tokens lol they can just mint some from thin air right
350488,this one too
350489,that one gives 5 a day
350490,doesnt work on kovan
350491,rinkeby does work though
350492,lol i wonder if we make a testnetmainnet market what would be the price
350493,faucetschainlink will give you kovan and rinkeby eth 01 at a time
350494,aint much but it aint 0
350495,it would prob be the biggest faucet
350496,funny that testnet eth would actually have real eth value
350497,just have to make wrapped testnet eth for this to work
350498,basically what kusama is for dot for eth
350499,lol one can prob build a decentralized bridge
350500,but wouldnt work they are literally printing this stuff for free and a lot of people has a ton
350501,so this would be the faucet with the highest amount of liquidty
350502,dev would pay 0000001 mainet eth for 1 kovan eth or something
350503,but this faucet will fill itself
350504,great for devs
350505,prob pita to write this bridge tho
350506,like 400 hrs of work
350507,keep your bug secret wait for the protocol to get rich and set up a bug bounty
350508,tbh it may be better to have a service that you can pay to maintain testnet nodes and the testnet eth mined from the nodes is distributed among the sponsors
350509,risk of someone else reporting the bug before you
350510,this is one of the things i realised recently defis having an even harder time getting new recruits to the ecosystem because of the way most of the marketing strategyteams are structured i assume growth is the marketing team they are doing great too as far as growth and product work goes its up there with the best really but most arent doing a lot on brand part itself
350511,sadly normies run after stories and identities a lot more than the quality and product itself
350512,larger scale projects need to work on better recruitment branding projects
350513,
350514,most current nft marketplaces only allow for listings where one party agrees to supply an nft and the other agrees to supply a payment token seaport takes a different approach offerers can agree to supply a number of eth erc20 erc721 erc1155 items this is the offer in order for that offer to be accepted a number of items must be received by the recipients indicated by the offerer this is the considerationsounds too similar to me i think ive read a paper on such mechanics a couple of weeks ago i think it was unrelated to os am i dreaming or there was actually smth
350515,anyone know if this is actually shkreli
350516,yes
350517,fr
350518,yeah hes in some telegrams already
350519,jfc
350520,based
350521,
350522,he got released from prison yesterday and comes back immediately as a ethereum bro
350524,why isnt he in lobsterdao
350525,why did they choose to build infura on aws why not awsazure or smth
350526,does someone know of a writeup that explains the different ways in which a prediction market can be implemented onchainim particularly interested in the ways to market make provide liquidity not so much about how to come to consensus on outcomes
350527,not about implementation but
350528,solidly
350529,solidly amm design was really innovative and on ftm first it didnt work as plan as it was launched with bugs but it innovation was there now its becoming replicated on other chains bnb chain metis
350530,im learning to build a defi derivatives trading protocol can you share any resources to get started with
350531,l2s count dopex would be one in that case
350532,
350533,seizure warning folks
350534,0xperp has the best collection of resources for derivatives i have seen might be worth checking out
350535,are there any good sites for making 0x limit orders other than matcha and sudoswap i just want a website where i can make an order and then send out a link for ppl who might want to fill it
350536,not 0x but this is a great tool for this
350537,thanks bantg checking it out
350538,this is a great start but one thing that is missing is that theres no way to partial fill an order got any other similar tools i can test out
350539,it supports partial fills if i remember right
350540,oh thanks i guess i didnt go far enough in the flow to test that out need to try taking my own test order
350541,who
350546,i went through the flow and theres no option for a partial fill
350547,is there any way to cross harmony to cosmos
350549,if you guys are interested in onchain analytics
350551,connext
350552,or nomad
350553,thx fam
350554,
350556,has anyone found out yet whose wallet was the biggest yes voter but directly funded from lfg as team and lfg were said to not take part
350557,quite a few very important onchain metrics are missed
350558,for example without understanding on how redistribution is working you are missing a lot
350559,hey thanks for the feedback i am sure a lot of metrics are missing but due to accessibility constraints we had to choose a very few
350560,i would have added 34 more but yeah
350561,
350562,
350563,is this a normal budget in murica you guys live like kings wtf
350564,yes never skips a beat lol
350565,it s not easy to ger investirs these days they dont want to take risks first of all the want to see adoption of your product exponential users base growth but some products you cant build without investments this is a death loop
350566,even if there is a token and equity it doesnt always help it may sound as funny psyop but when you pretend that you dont need funding you are more likely to get it
350567,not sure was it shared already anyhow nice graphical representation of math when u are making vaults and shares for vaults
350571,this is a really good point once the project is launched and successfully operational i may just do a call for funding and see what terms we can reach independently maybe im naive but i feel like a gentlemans agreement is always possible
350574,butt dial
350576,i can attest to that vcs get major fomo
350577,sorry if the question is stupid but im not a mac user at alltrying to compile a js script into executable with pkgfor windows works perfect so trying to make for macos using the following t node14macosarm64 for m1 chip it doesnt work saying executable is damaged when trying to launch on mac am i doing smth wrong i definitely am but idk what exactly
350578,dont really use mac but have you tried compiling it for x64 and running via rosetta does that work
350579,will try ty
350580,another good solution can be exploring deno it has support for compiling executables out of the box and is mostly compatible with js
350581,
350582,
350583,its implicit in their regulatory cover if they fail to do that they breach the regs that protect them for custodial at least
350585,
350586,not a special stablecoin in my book
350587,overcollateralized ltv 300 required boring
350588,interesting model it seems that andre learns something from snx
350589,serious question actually want to know the answer for you guys when uncollaterlized stables talk about being capital efficient what do they actually mean for me as a retail buyer i pay 1 for 1 worth of stable so theres no capital efficiency for me correct is it just more capital efficient for the issuer aka its nice to be able to launch a stable coin with no capital needed what so ever
350590,yes look up seigniorage
350591,yeah i get seigniorage i was just trying to figure out if im missing something and there is actual capital efficiency or some sort of benefit for users so basically uncollaterlized stable coins are aweful for everyone except the people cashing in on printing them so every stable coin shilling being capital efficient is just tricking people into thinking that actually helps them
350592,ser thats a strawman
350593,if you call the entire point being tricked you only have yourself to blame
350594,capital efficiency or lack thereof is basic stuff its not like algorithmic stablecoins invented the concept
350595,
350596,here is something i tweeted out this video offers a great deal of information on different stablecoins i think a lot of people could benefit from watching the whole thing
350597,see eg recent hayes article on stablecoinswhat you pay as the buyer doesnt really factor into the collateralization question
350598,fair enough so besides it being a straw man is there any benefit to users that are actively being pitched capital efficiency
350599,the benefit exists on the same plane that caused dai to accept freezable collateral despite eth working well enough growth
350600,no except that non collateralised stables find it easier to increase supply and therefore adoption
350601,the only thing a stablecoin can sell in this market is its supply its nice to pretend only the algo stablecoins care about growing their supply beyond the confines of theira single collateral but pretense is all it is
350602,this thread by sam might be of interest to you
350604,awesome yeah thats super helpful i like frax and fei seems like a pretty good compromise between growth and not nuking at least too bad later on
350605,bndaibnethbnlink our current bn tokens in bancor 3 current admin is the poolcollection contract that mints these tokens to liquidity providersthe top admin is an eoa for the next few weeks before moving to the bancor dao multisig its highly secure and is needed at this early stage as we scale up version 3 of the bancor protocol for quick response in case of an emergency
350606,if i recall there is a mint option for users depositing and a separate function to mint with only adminsaying an eoa is highly secure is not reassuring as it introduces trust to a system that is supposed to be trustless
350607,can someone differentiate starknet and starkex in simple words
350608,please google
350609,i am logged in starkware website
350613,any devs building anything on imx here
350615,would love to know that too
350616,risky but you can stay 100 owner this way nice option if the founder can bear it
350617,were discontinuing the stablegains service please withdraw remaining fundsarticle comments
350620,garbage translation we told you it would be a basket of stable coins instead we put all your money in ust at 20 and paid you 15 ust is dead so were out peace
350621,metamask refreshing gas few infura connection bug not allowing the calculation to happen some fault etc i assume not metamask related but smth like that
350623,try to click the small arrow that scrolls you down to the end of the sig data that usually does it for me
350625,heh the celsius strategy but they picked what turned out to be dynamite as their opening salvo
350626,dune is based on postgres but has said its moving to spark
350627,theres a public bigquery set you can query fairly expensive though at a cost of 5 dollars per tb a query can easily scan 1 tb so many queries you make will cost you that
350628,its not free though the queries will cost you
350629,dune can take quite a long time to run queries but ya probably better
350630,this is true logged into dydx today im not in a sanctioned country or the us and the only action i can do is withdrawmaybe due to the good practice of using a vpn ive been blocked however there is no avenue for discussion so just withdraw and move on
350631,is there anyth wrong with rainbow bridge
350632,takes forever to bridge funds out of near
350633,generally takes the amount of time it says before you bridge 8 hours to eth if i remember correctly
350634,what are you building
350635,that happens to me sometimes if the window isnt big enough to read the whole message try resizing the window
350636,i second what justsomedeveloper asked what are you building also how are you presenting your project honestly the vc game is like a big club if you know someone in the club particularly someone whos known and respected you honestly dont need a lot of raise
350637,if youre outside this club or cant get an intro its very difficult to raise
350638,we had a really hard time raising for our first product so we build a design and dev shop and it took us a year but we bootstrapped the mvp
350639,along the way we meet the right people y voila
350640,the only thing more exhausting than raising money is looking for a job
350641,which is why most entrepreneurs become serial entrepreneurs till theyre 5 yrs from retiring at which point theyve either made their millions or have had enough success to land a cushy gig at a big consulting firm
350642,what are you building also how are you presenting your project sdk for new and existing metaverses that results in an actually decentralized gamelike environment that lets you own your experience and be downtime and censorship resistantpresenting with pocs and an explanation of what it is we are building we have strong commitments from really high profile individuals and funds it is not like we wont close the round i was just saying we are not seeing the fabled showering of money at this point in time we have to actually try vs the legend of they keep throwing money at us
350643,how does one get into this club
350644,i am poor now cant pay the cover i am willing to sell my body
350645,one of my favorite patrick rothfuss quote you have to be a bit of a liar to tell a story the right way
350646,youre not degenerate enough
350647,most of the showering of money ive seen has been in lower quality more imagine the usecsse projects where the funds fill in the blanks lol
350648,the best way to succeed in crypto is to keep promising and never deliver because once you deliver theres nothing else to speculate on so you simply keep on piling on the promises
350650,ada feels violated
350652,i do get told i am too realistic and honest about what we are building it was a financial mistake to try and build something useful when i could have just hired a ue5 guy from fiverr to make a demo and call it a metaverse would be chilling now live and neverlearn
350653,subsocial mirrorxyz
350654,dont worry itll pay off in the long run when everyone burns through their cash has an oh shit moment and quickly realizes they have to sink or swim thats when they will rush to the useful stuff
350655,i would agree once upon a time there are heavily funded companies and teams that are now badly copying what we do and they do this because they have millions of runway from raising for 5 years on nothing other than promises so i think you actually have to start dishonest in this space even if you want to end up honest
350656,yeah being scammy to get capital early gives you much more runway to pivotmarket doesnt adequately reward honest actors rn imo
350657,whats the origin story of lobster dao
350658,it was a dark and stormy night
350659,when suddenly an old man bumped at our door
350660,
350663,sirs anyone uses gnosis msig on binance chain doesnt work
350664,how to create gnosis multisig at bnb chain anybody knows
350665,gnosissafeio ser
350666,change the chain at top right corner
350667,yep thanks
350668,just listened to the podcast you did super cool stuff for anyone thats interested
350669,appreciate it theres a video version too on krakens youtube
350670,
350671,wat
350672,its so tiring not even reading anything about it anymore so much drama and bs just let it be die or prosper
350673,its a legacy it should stop using it there is an official deployment on gnosissafeand migration or renewal is not possible they dont seem to know there i dont remember whether the update manager or something like that from the mechanisms was cuffed bad shitty deployed shorter and cant be updated to the official versionsi dont remember when last year but it was a long time ago i didnt know that the interface was still working it was going to be turned off after the departure of the main part of the users the date was set and so on
350674,excuse me i automatically translate from russianalso fyi safefantomnetwork or something like that deployment not official on the phantom suddenly you would like to know about this subdomain here youve learned i hope it will come in handy
350675,so multi sigs launched via that interface and factory are dead now
350676,lol
350677,no they just wont be updated this interface is easy and youd better move but these are the same contracts what can happen to them whats sick here theres a bone here
350678,if you need to be able to use gnosis through some other mechanism you think you will look at the admin mechanism or something like that from defenderopenzeppelin there the only nuance is that you need to take abi of the appropriate version you can in etherscan at any gnosissafe address falling
350679,that might be usefulandrey from oz painted very well the details and beautiful understandable illustrative examples of how to use itvery convenient for a long time for more than one and a half or even soon we will be using it for a couple of years since the release was released they launched it all at the same time as our expensive sunfaced andre launched keepernetwork great thing
350680,one of the threads mentions searchers shhh other searchers are going to stop fucking around with assembly and realize they can use vyper soon what does the term searcher refer to any ideas
350684,probably means people looking for gas optimizations otherwise i only know it being used for mev searchers
350685,yeah i was thinking of the flashbot searcher too but didnt think they care that much about gas optimizations
350686,same their profit margin shouldnt depend on that
350687,the solver is in gnosis terminologyfor a minute ill have a couple of links to explain this topic directly beautifully if i understood everything correctly
350688,for example this video is
350689,and wp
350690,cowfi worked on gnosis protocol v2
350695,the only thing imo that makes sense for prediction markets is a clob but pms have also felt like a solution in search of problem for the past 5 years
350697,also theyre immediately in breach of fin regs in most western countries its not even a grey area sadly
350701,its ok cool to share ur own research sometimes in here even if branded grow it is fine but absolute noobiecontent is not the spot thx
350702,what is referred to as noobie content
350703,explaining the google level of what otc is is a noobie content ur previous share was totally cool tho had more data some unique stuff super welcome to share
350704,thank you for the kind words although we might have different point of view on what is a noobie content argumenting in easy manners is crucial to understand later in the thread the whole metrics onchainthank you for the feedback tho

350707,is terra ibc open yet
350708,cannot get assets crossed
350712,lynaldencomdebtjubilee
350713,found it cool no need to discuss macro here though
350714,honesty is paid last but most
350715,frens could anyone plz help i am currently listening on block events via ethers js and checking few conditions on the block then if its true send a tx so the problem is that while my tx is still pending condition stays true and hence on the next block the same tx gets executed again causing revert and wasted gas looking to find the robust way to pause the listener when tx is executed and continue when its mined could not find anything in ethers js docs
350716,i assume doing an arbitrary settimeout isnt going to help things _
350717,i usually wait for the next block to listen again
350718,just loop until blocknum lastblock
350719,doesnt really work for now on testnet as im not always included in the same block it gets invoked will work with budle on mainnet fo sure yh so theres no pause function on block at all yh gosh i dont wanna go down to go path again
350720,you could just explicitly listen for your tx
350721,an easy way is checking for your nonce
350722,i guess you can also do some offchain logic with sending exactly one message eg when conditions are met you send the tx and set lock key can be stored in redis shall you have multiple service instances or just boolean variable in memory when listening you just check if the blockchain conditions are met and your lock isnt taken lock is removed when your tx suceeds
350723,
350724,kinda interesting
350725,
350726,thank you ser
350727,its like the spiderman meme
350728,what happened to 0xb1 he moved his shit to a new address
350729,capital efficiency is just another word for leverage when used incorrectly its a dangerous weapon
350730,but by that logic isnt the graph the same too

350736,well as of march 8th the pace of ethereum subgraph migrations to the decentralized network is picking up fast up 30 quarteroverquarter this permissionless and opensource blockchain data ecosystem is now home to 160 indexers 2500 curators 8600 delegators and 282 subgraphs with more migrating each week
350737,whats the goal of this just to show whos invested in these companies
350738,heat map of sharing deal flows so you can check performance of tokens and get conclusion which solana starter pack shitcoin should avoid
350739,shows congruity of vcs

350741,thats why most of the projects dunking on each other and finger pointing for whatever reason
350742,clearer lines in the sand is not a bad thing we would have less fintechwithbrockshane posing as defi

350747,youre wanting to do whats in step 5 here not sure if its the exact same setup as you have but shows the steps
350748,anyone have a way to contact ari paul from blocktower
350749,u want to shill him deals
350750,hes responsive on twitter tho
350751,nah want to see if he wants to come on my podcast to talk about his liquidity theory
350752,his what
350753,stumbleuponrumble
350754,he believes cex defi liquidity is gonna drop alot in the coming months
350755,
350756,isnt that just standard le bear marketery
350757,well hope its not advanced bearmarketery
350758,doc says the signs dont look too good need more tests and maybe a biopsy to determine if its going up down or just vibes
350759,cant remember if i ask here or if possible
350760,how do i get a eth seed phrase with a private key
350761,pretty sure you dont its the other way around
350762,should be a way no
350763,considering 1 seed phrase infinite private keys that seems unlikely
350764,only way around is to move all the assets i have to a wallet i have the phrase too
350765,that is the way or private key

350776,this is autotask code example

350779,nan
350780,nan
350781,nope somehow that didnt come up when googling but hundred variation of the whitepaper with the exact same graphs did thanks it gives me a clearer idea about the leverage component from the whitepaper
350782,i just received about 200 in wbtc from bittrex outta nowhere i remember having an account from 2017 but i dont even remember if i put anything on it if i try to log in i cant access the account cause i need to verify my identityany clue
350783,are you sure its not a phishing email
350784,nono its on etherscan and i can verify that its real wbtc and from the real bittrex address
350785,could it be that i had 200 in dust they converted it in wbtc and they sent it to me cause i didnt verify my identity and they had to close the account
350786,so the address where the wbtc was sent is it owned by bittrex or you
350787,i didnt receive any email about it i just noticed cause i have notifications on for when i receive tokens in my wallet
350788,by me of course
350789,its my personal wallet
350790,then what you need bittrex for
350791,i dont need bittrex i was trying to understand why i did receive 200
350792,oh okay i thought you were trying to sell that wbtc on bittrex
350793,nono just wanted to login to see if there was any withdrawal or anything
350794,guys my friend is saying that after certik audit you need another audit do you trust certik audits who would you recommend to audit dao contracts
350795,all auditors seem to miss things so if you want to catch more issues id do additional audits a certik audit is minimal focus on security to me plenty of projects do 1 and plenty do more i have no recommendations though
350796,what about fields focus who would you recommend for dao audit like logical attacks liquidity attacks and such things altogether with tech stuff
350797,ctrl f please this topic has been discussed over and over and there are a lot of recommendations in past posts
350798,is there a rest api that provides a relatively updated map of ens and what address owns them
350799,want to avoid creating a web3 connection if i absolutely dont have to
350800,also trying to avoid graphql if i can
350801,graphql is reasonable to avoid i wish more people did i wish everyone did so that it can fade into obscurity but why shy away from web3 connection you can connect to a remote node and query it instantly unless you need the whole directory of everything
350802,maybe etherscan has one
350803,but there was an unloading mechanism in a text file wasnt it
350804,haha and it list is also printed in an electronic and paper book
350806,
350809,is there an easy way to consume dune dashboards as api endpoints
350810,but tbh if i am doing dune i might as well bite the graphql bullet and do the graph
350811,mm
350812,dune is sql and thegraph is what i wanted to offer instead of dune one dl or periodic sync
350813,periodic syncs the graph works well enough for that
350814,so i dont know where the solution is but heres what i found
350815,
350816,
350817,and this is the documentation of the person who is connected to ensbut tell me what is your desired task that you want to solvethe fact is that there is a difference between have a dump and cache it all at home or seeing always at hand and when the user comes i want to depict his information on the site in the office and improve visual aesthetics in various waysand also then im thinking about finding a readymade thegraph that it already provides i think it quite exists ill look for it later i became interested
350819,yeah i ended up using the hosted subgraph for ens just wanted to see if there is an alternative that doesnt use graphql because i am not using it for anything else and wanted to keep dependencies low
350820,might find some useful patterns
350826,for all new members we have strong ban and mute hammer for randomness and usually it lasts between forever and few months so have it in mind before posting
350827,must be a ton of eth held by failed 20178 icos

350830,cant they freeze usdc
350831,maybe if government agencies were paying close attention to zach or if they are might be waiting to see if additional connections are made hard to guess really
350832,what are the issues with relying tee vs storing private data on ipfsarweave love to understand more about privacy chains and their pitfalls would appreciate it if anyone could provide guides or links to read up more on it struggling to understand the technical stuff
350833,derivadex has a tee component to it worth exploring
350835,intels trusted execution environment tee is a secure area of the cpu some people prefer not to trust it for remote computation of encrypted data because tee has been hacked a few times exposing sensitive user dataarweave storage is arguably permanent if the encryption algorithm used to store your private data was ever hacked the private data could become accessible to othersipfs has no native incentivisation layer so people could stop storing the document so you need to pay trusted companies to pin the document
350836,
350837,if tee is hacked would the data breach be isolated only for that cpu it would seem like arweave is way more dangerous since the encryption algo is universal for the data stored once the algorithm is figured out all the data will be exposed if thats the case whats the reasoning between choosing tee vs arweave
350839,new shit has come to light hope evidence is coming too
350842,waiting for facts for now its just gibberish
350843,isnt this true for any encryption algorithm ie if aes was was ever hacked we are all screwed
350844,are we staying away from lunaterra gossip too
350845,from any gossip really
350846,buy your lobs now to get access to the juiciest gossip in lobsterdao kingdom covering all the milady and terra gossip in realtime there
350850,hey everyone just small reminder for all lobster nft holders that are still not in lobsters kingdom chat pls go over the process here and join
350852,ok to share here any discussion can happen in kingdom just before we resort to tinfoil convos in an open chat haha _
350853,i am not sure why you are making a comparison between the two tbh tee is used for computation of data in a secure environment ipfsarweave are used for data storagetbh your best bet is probably to never store private data in public this includes gmail dropbox facebook etc but people still do and theres an argument that privately encrypting it locally and uploading it would be more secure than trusting a 3rd party like icloud with the same data as samueldare mentions if an encryption algorithm gets broken that could put blockchain security banks etc at riskregarding ipfsarweave being dangerous i believe that the majority of data stored would be unencrypted data fit for public consumption
350854,
350857,this blog has a lot
350858,
350859,waited 3 yrs for the market bottom to cash out interesting ppl ngl
350860,
350861,this is not different really from many things seen before
350862,the issue is always that in daos the most credible daos dont need the like this if they already got revenue streams
350863,and if they dont then it simply becomes a venture game cause u bet on who up who down ofc collateral makes the credit risk a biiiiit lower
350864,especially because of that stablecoin issuers likely have a better chance of running such a business like what frax is doing w the extra cr
350865,cause bringing capital from the other side into such credit risk even if reduced w collateral might not match what projects can pay
350866,cause 1015 paying is pretty high barely any dao can cover this now and also means they wont be able to pay anything to their shareholders after that
350867,but a cool tool for daos would be glad to take some of their money probably depending on the rates
350869,ribbon is looking to set one up with porter more details can be found here
350870,gib me too
350871,welp rbn overdid the coll by 500 yet being pretty liquid huh
350872,i also wonder how the call options work as in how much call options is this for the 3m or the 15m rbn
350873,
350874,nice work philippzentner make sure it stays impartial
350875,hello sers where can i find analytics about immutablex network usage daily users daily transactions etc kinda similar metrics like etherscan
350876,what happens if u have luna on exchanges does it get converted to luna
350877,i think like with other forks it depends on exchange to support or not
350878,
350879,any tldr shill heychristopher
350880,imagine having both scammy weak hands
350881,math doesnt really add up did they have massive slippage
350882,tldr increase competition for value add services available for founders better unit economics for token network dilution long service daos
350883,what could those be lets say i am in a dao lololo
350884,
350885,is this real lol
350886,you didnt know tulip story huh
350887,nope thought it was always real fking boomers rugged me again
350888,better
350889,yield flower farming
350890,no it was never that big and the whole thing isb s
350891,different varieties via crossbreeding you can mix and mint your own via selection
350892,tulip mania was a mcuh smaller bubble than bored apes it was restricted to a small portion of dutch society and there was practically no contagion but it was a good narrative and economic historians just blew it out of proportion a century later best study 1920s or 1600s mississipi bubble if you want historic context
350893,for financial bubbles always best to study contagion effects if its restricted within an ecosystem and normal folks have not lost money its just markets being markets
350894,hows bayc a bubble its the marquee product of a insanely profitable techentertainment company is espn a bubble or do we now call every success story a bubble or do we actually have some smart criteria around this term
350895,btw this is why composability is such a twoedged sword if you have a luna style fall out on eth you never know where the domino effects can lead to because ethdefi is far more embedded in retail facing products
350896,jpegs vs espn bold
350897,i meant in the event that bayc goes to 0 its a restrained bubble idc what these apes are
350898,why is the most succesful project in the space used as a strawman for that argument though can we choose an actual flop or fundamentally unsound project
350899,why do we talk about nasjay z in the context of hip hop and not some 12 year old with a soundcloud people mention names they remember
350900,wouldnt we use nas or jayz as a positive example entertainers who have a massive reach such as jayz im just surprised how its still on top of minds as a bubble after all this roi and real revenue in a world most tech companies can survive only with a massive burn rate and unprofitable scaling strategies
350901,too ealry to not call it a bubble barely been around 1820 months i get your point thoi still dont know what bored ape does other than signaling you are rich 1020 people trade it each day at 100k200k price and a portion of it goes to their lab great groundbreaking tech revolutionary i mean the bit where two celeb managers get 50 celebs to put nfts as pfp is cool but idk i think pokemon go is cooler idc and doubt most people outside our bubble care
350902,i have nothing against bored ape im just putting things from a cynical pov if we are to abstract all of our own faith in the system
350903,fundamentally unsound projectwait are we assuming this one isnt based on what
350904,sure thats a value judgment np just wanted to be clear about such terms or else we gonna hate on every success story
350905,highest sales in a growing industries by a large margin
350906,hate is a big word if i truly hate something i wont bother mentioning it here and giving it unnecessary pr ser i wrote like 23 pieces on the apes been following them since early now enough nft talk beforei van comes and screams at me
350907,by that logic bitconnect was once fundamentally sound in the ponzi markets
350908,lol ok
350909,hello all is it possible for one to construct a smart contract to combine multiple transactions into one single transaction
350910,eg 1 claim erc20 tokens from a smart contract 2 send erc20 tokens to another addressboth actions done in a single transaction
350911,again if you are designing a scarce instrument that is traded it will have high sales you are going with the wrong kpi here
350912,numba go up does not fundamentally sound make
350913,thats the same dubious logic that litters this space with all sorts of garbage
350914,whats your prefrerred kpi
350915,look you can say bored apes took nfts mainstream celebrities use bored apes bored apes was on live television if i put that all in a kpi its really brand recognition they also did some good strategising on the licensing side with cryptopunks disaster and eventual acquisition all of which deserves praisebt if you came and said a monkey face is the most consequential thing in cryptoid be hard pressed to buy that likely that spot is taken by uniswap aavemakercomp curve etc obv bored ape is up there because its opened a whole new market and alternative ways of thinking about licensing but cant take sales as the kpi
350917,they put the market in marketing
350918,deleting text coz not good to shill other chats here
350920,its a flex a marketing exercise its created a clique of elitists crypto is meant to be an open and inclusive financial system for everyone and this just goes against it artwork isnt even that great
350921,end rant
350922,my opinion gfy
350923,i dig this energy
350924,nft ticketing and tamper proof documents nft proof of ownership of asset look how rich i am because i have a jpeg you cant afford
350925,yeah very easily
350926,ser you are forgetting nfts as financial tools
350927,any guide
350928,
350929,doesnt that fall under his second point broadly
350930,ultimately proof of ownership of something into a financial tool tho but yeah my list isnt exhaustive i just dont like how cult like and elitist certain communities have become im mainly rantingshitposting anyway
350931,i suppose it would though i was thinking he meant more irl ownership it is after all purely semantic
350932,i am a lobster pfp connoisseur after all
350933,which section should i zoom into robanon
350934,anyone uses the graphs hosted service with websockets my connections are getting disconnected every second to the point where i feel short polling may be more efficient than this anyone else has the same experience regarding connection instability
350935,anyone here knows whats a good alternative to raris fuse pool that allows project to set up a permissionless lending pool
350936,rari disabled borrowing after the exploit
350937,the exploitwhich one
350938,
350939,most recent
350940,lol
350941,i dont like this quality projects are not growing and even worse is people lose their money in shitty projects
350942,would it be safe to say thats part of the way that history repeats itself dotcom bubble is most recent in human memory but the simple fact that snake oil salesman is a part of the lexicon from around the time of the industrial revolution should indicate that theres nothing really new about this pattern
350943,this seems like a convo for kingdom potentially not here
350944,i mean you can very easily lump the dogcoins in here too just the entire market stance during this last bull started off about defi summer very quickly devolved into a shitcoin showdown
350945,i dont think it bears worrying about good actors will prosper because they keep building bad actors will struggle because they are leeches long enough deltat all balances out to reward creativity and innovation
350949,kingdom
350950,join the seafood kingdom for lobster nfts

350956,0 btc
350959,did a bit of a deep dive on undercollateralized lending in defi hope some of yall enjoy the read
350960,probably one of the biggest bottlenecks in defi at the moment
350961,maybe its not a bottleneck not sure it has to 11 replicate irl
350962,fair point abt defi being able to pave its own path but loans are one of the few ways wealth is actually created ie 1 deposited in a bank usually creates 5 in wealth through redeposits for mass adoption overcollateralization will be very restrictive for those that defi aims to serve
350963,would love any feedback criticism tho always looking to learn and improve ivangbi
350964,people will support all sorts of weirdness for this mass adoption fetish
350965,but mass adoption means price action
350966,lol rare honesty
350967,how do i can understand from generated artifact type of sol file like contract or interface
350968,but nobody ever seems to realize it wont happen as sold for the same reason where theyre coming from doesnt have such ridiculous price action
350970,i agree the high price tag is unjustified im afraid that after the release of the game there will be a strong disappointment
350971,not for certain bank accounts though
350972,
350974,wouldnt pulsechain be more of a ghost town how many of those retail investors actually produce any significant amount of traffic on defi maybe a few days frenzy on pulsex or uniswap at most
350975,ponzi enjoyoooors suckered into the lifestyle and certain marketing style of the ecosystem chain itself will be a meme
350976,when they get rektinnocent retail
350977,there will be nfts thats for sure
350978,can someone explain the most obvious consequences of a mev supernova since i dont know what it is and even reading about it cannot grasp perhaps seeing the consequences help me out here
350979,that the prices are not pegged to anything as they are copied erc20s making it fun to arb and also to manipulate prices for fun and more profit
350980,in essence its gonna be a shitshow for retail but a fortune making event for botters
350981,at least thats my take on it
350982,might be wrong
350983,aside from miners and nodes lots of things keep the chain ticking over contracts are updated with current prices from offchain sources to keep liquidations running being one thing
350984,dont think botters will care unless theres a liquid asset that actually holds any value on that chain to liquidate and bring back across the bridge
350985,theres always the threads and articles proclaiming innocent retail euphemism for willful ponzi enthusiasts and bootstrappers got scammed therefore we need regulation
350986,for protection of course
350987,so who is releasing the first stablecoin backed by pls
350988,well sandwiching will be a big thing i guess
350989,sure but only if something liquid exists and is worthwhile
350990,stuff like wbtc usdt usdc and dai arent going to be underwritten by their respective issuers over this side
350991,im still trying to understand how stepn made it
350992,
350993,
350994,its just another dumb new idea to extract value its making a tonne on internal exchange volume itll fade no doubt
350995,
350996,walking is lindy
350997,chad founders focus on lindy effect lol
351002,i mean yeah its not about onchain linkeability only probably most of them are just blocked by behavior analysis
351003,too little volume too little use of a protocol just using it once etc etc
351004,nfts poaps shit starts to add up
351005,any idea how porter compares to debt dao
351006,i havent done enough research on debtdao to have a nuanced understanding however i do know they are offering revenue based loans while we are offering bond issuances backed by collateral
351009,what are the best resources on web3 business modelsseems sort of crazy how theres so much building happening that doesnt seem to make a lot of business sense
351010,whether its speculative tokens or nfts at least this i can somewhat understand or businesses like poap with funding but no revenue or rainbow wallet or another 100 wallets out there is most of the industry based on grants and some sort of external funding mechanism does this mean we eventually see most of these products die or hope for their metamask revenue moments
351011,a lot of the industry does start as grants ecosystems have lots of money and are incentivized to throw as much as possible to their community to build granted most projects never get completed or operationalize but it does allow for people to explore new use cases
351012,most grants programs are poorly managed because of the sheer number of applicants
351013,1 most web3 business are poor cash flow revenue companies as of now the web3 index revenue baffles me tbh
351014,that being said as with a lot of public goods still need to be built to allow sustainable community development
351015,most of projects fueled by vc money and betting on a future growth
351016,while i struggle with nfts too collectibles have been a niche business for decades which runs entirely on speculation so there is a place for such business models in the over arching ecosystem
351017,were all throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks
351019,im actually pretty deep in nfts so that i can somewhat understand at least as a business artist sells art and makes money simple whether its smart for someone to buy is questionable but at least as a business its super clearbut a lot of the rest is far more hazy to me
351020,this is totally nuts the graph actually does only 2k revenue per quarterthey awarded some friends a 48m contract 1m per month for 4 years
351021,something like the graph is not meant to make money its meant to be a public good
351022,maybe theyre not meant to be businesses
351023,not saying that there isnt any corruption
351024,that payment wasnt corruption theyre writing code and graph worth a few bil so even makes economic sense potentially but still crazy
351025,what are they meant to be
351026,is it a public good you pay for the service
351027,you pay for transmission of electricity
351028,but the amount has to do with maintenance and not the capex of installing the electric grid
351030,not businesses everyone and their mother trying to startupify a runofthemill project just because its fashionable to do only to realize x years later that its not
351031,people create startups for reasons other than fashion
351032,to make money is one simple reason
351033,but again what are these projects if not businessesand is it sustainable
351034,if the graph did want to be a business they would be a dataasa service business like infura
351035,they built the aggregation engine but didnt really build a monetization layer
351036,because monetization was never the goal
351037,long term is this in any way sustainable
351038,sure they built it using someone elses money and now we pay to maintain it
351039,that someone else paid them to build their product because the blockchain would be unusable without a data availability layer
351040,sustainable for whom
351041,rugpulls and grant driven startups also make a lot of money
351042,ultimately kick starting an ecosystem with grant funding is not fundamentally an unsustainable thing any ecosystem requires certain process as well as a certain flow of resources to become self sustaining thats what grants are trying to do get the community to reach a critical mass
351043,and not every project is optimizing for profit or even self sufficiency
351044,research is the backbone of innovation but is in it totally dependent of external funding
351045,it took uber 10 years to finally become profitable majority of publicly listed arent profitable and neither they plan to be in the coming yearsimo profitability stopped being an important kpi for businesses a long time ago
351046,profitable businesses have to pay taxes
351047,on the other hand the current vc ecosystem is built around exits which are insanely profitable for investors
351048,does anyone know of any research into the performance of the jsonrpc apis of various evm clients
351049,im working on a very data heavy application and it looks like most apis are not fit to handle the load
351050,rusts web3 crate is one of the fastest
351051,shouldnt the api release this information in their slas
351052,sorry i think i posed the question wrong i meant performance at the client level for example erigon geth arbitrum node polygon node etc
351053,for example im finding that arbitrum eth_calls take way longer than geth
351054,does anybody know of anything like appzerionio that will show a nice tradetransaction history but for gnosis chainxdai supporting swapr and sushiswap and such
351055,debank works i think
351056,okay followup question is there any way to get debank and zerion to recognize tokens which are not in their lists
351057,opensea vs magiceden is among most interesting things to watch this year
351058,is this for real
351059,lol of course not but it is hilarious
351060,bot signal i guess
351061,the coinbase bankruptcy note fud at that exact time was a good buy oppty aint it not sure if anyone is tracking coinbase ventures unlocks but ventures investments alone mostly seed rounds could yield a significant windfall for them

351089,
351090,ty king
351092,the bigger oof is people still thinking they can rely on service providers for privacy either you take care of it yourself or you can just accept your fate of being trackedwhat i mean is that it should not matter whether you use google or duckduckgo if you have a proper setup and that you should not assume that one is better than the other even if it potentially is
351093,liquidation is your insurance
351094,protocols insurance
351096,what about the protocol are you trying to insure exactly liquidation prevents you from being in debt to a protocol
351099,lobs what are your thoughts on intergrating options we are planning to with dexs the idea is to use options put as a hedgeinsurance against spot buying positions but on dexsis this feasible
351100,sounds good but could be incredibly confusing for users so its more of a ux innovation than product innovaiton in that you have to make it flawless or it can blow up
351101,you may also not have enough liquidity in defi
351102,100 this whiteheart already tried to do something like this but issues were1 liquidity was shit there was like 12m usd available2 premiums were insanely high 10 per month or something in that rangei wouldnt say ux was bad since it was quite straightforward wrap your eth into wheth which is a hedged position of eth
351103,910 of capital protected
351104,issue is more the mkt lacks layered risk appetite so you basically cant convince ppl to lock their assets for option writing
351105,or perhaps overestimating the number of people that tangibly know what an option means and of those that do have a problem using the centralized offers available whatever those might be
351106,the product is years ahead of the crowd but fun to see atlantic rediscover it again
351107,understand your point of view but thinking bout how to offer additional insurance
351108,you can not it is a zero sum game insurances need to be sustainable and want to make money as well
351109,maybe have a look at ruler
351110,its also no coincidence that larger insurers all have multi decade investment horizons to balance out their risk
351111,but if insurance costs less then liquidation fee it could be
351112,thanks
351113,dont invest in sketchy protocols will lower your risk of liquidation significantly
351114,its just marketing thoughts regarding zeroliquidation solutions
351115,such things do not exist if there is leverage you will get liquidated one way or another someone ends up paying you can redefine the terms and act like its different but it really isnt
351116,you shouldnt frame it like a challenge someone will go i can make it work
351117,thats why i see that as a marketing trick but if peeps like it wine not
351118,sounds intriguing
351119,yeah a marketing trick like bitconnect how about we stop misleading people about the nature of the products they are engaging with
351121,
351122,what the fuck is this fake

351134,cant believe a16z is shilling this despite the fact what carbon reduction is a way for companies to save money because of benefits from govt it has no relation with public blockchain and especially new shitcoin sellwho they are to sell carbon points now
351135,i dont know what that flowcarbon thing is but basically carbon credits speculate on demand from companies in relation to government regulations and subsidiesif governments give benefits to companies to offset their carbon emissions and there is low supply of carbon credits the token itself can pump from demand up to the point where the government benefits balance the token costs
351136,its like regulatory arbitrage
351137,arent carbon credits impossible to verify being double sold d
351138,did someone call my name
351139,carbon credits but blockchain is a 2017 meme
351140,that refuses to die
351141,its a difficult market because crypto projects in that space need to work together with regulators and get verified by govt basically
351142,not really gives retail easy access to otherwise mostly closed and too broad options
351143,esgrelated and their lps are pushing for this so yes out of tokenomics consideration it makes sense for them to have this in portfolio
351144,afaik carbon credits are the next upwardstransferscam
351145,i meant in general carbon credits are impossible to verify the owner of the carbon credit land double selling cross border etc etc
351146,not if all those things are regulated
351147,a lot of centralization
351148,carbon credits help the planet as much as lowcost flying helped local economies makes sense on the surface just more room for aggregating gains from the many to the few
351149,thats why this is blockchain but for carbon credits its different
351150,now with 100 more inefficient data structures
351151,tbh the thing is the ultimate virtue signaling silicon valley circlejerk raise
351152,the only industry happy with carbon credits is the oilgas as they can show they are green while just buying cc
351153,second this it pumps in tradfi even now add blockchain
351154,yes and large nations can throw more weight around on smaller nations using cc as leverage
351155,see china
351156,would include us but they got bombs no need for cc scams
351157,just wait till i release my ethically sourced organic homegrown blockchain gerab00x by ivangbi will be the first dapp
351158,is it even abt that or just a way to make money
351159,ofc its about money but they will shill the shit out of the its gud for environmen narrative attached to it
351160,yeah but thats the same for everything nothing about virtue
351161,theres a lot of environmently friendly blockchains already and ify ou are really worried you can offset it through carbon credits like polygon did theres transition to pos which should also help
351162,i just hope adam didnt trademark environment friendly before doing this raise
351163,its better than nothing how many trees did you save
351164,old habits die hard
351165,alibaba has a clever way to make money out of users carbon footprint whenever a user use online payment or take busmetro to work they will collect their carbon credit and sell it
351166,social credit is bad mmkay
351167,just wait until the involved parties start talking about it they will present themselves as the saviors of the planet which is virtue signaling in my book
351168,is this satire
351169,no we have to save the planet im surprised nobody thinks of how much energy all the defi chaddery here uses up
351170,bitcoin is saving us from oppressive govts isnt that virtue signaling as well
351171,i think about all the energy we could save
351172,time to brand lobsterdao to petadao
351173,i think more about how much energy is wasted from tradfi and all those useless middle mens jobs its like 10x blockchain iirc but im dumb
351174,sers a bit floody fin
351175,yeah but what alibaba is doing is to get ppl plant virtual trees on their app and when the users collects enough carbon points theyll plant a real tree their profit is way bigger than what they have spent on planting the trees theres a huge profit in this biz those countries or companies who doesnt reach the standard discharge they buy carbon credits
351176,iirc with squeeth the users dont get liquidated just the liquidity providers or something along those lines
351177,and what do they do with your funds in return for that no one takes risk off you for free you are probably funding some sort of trading strategy or paying fees for them
351178,as a lawyer which been involved into credits trading by ukraine government in 20082009 can confirm and actually since ukraines lost most of its industrial production which is naturally not recognized this is a great opportunity to sell unused quotas so i think that soon the representatives of a megasuccessful startup will go to negotiations in ukraine
351179,i love the mind your carbon footprint peoplebill gates emits more carbon with his private jet and yacht in a week compared to your carbon footprint in 20 years
351180,ok blz stop w carbon credits enough info drama thanks love it
351181,wanting to understand the main reason eth devs hate cardano is this because its coded in haskell which is more complex than solidity or is it because its just underwhelming from a performance point of view to date and should they fulfill their roadmap of developments will they be a chain of top tier value
351182,because it has 247 roadmaps bullshit claims a lot of muh research an egocentric maniac w a youtube channel never delivering scam shilling etc
351183,when the ceo has to use the support email to get ahold of metamask you know its a bad chain
351184,couldnt have asked for a more straight to the point answer tenx ser
351185,its because most of the cardano coding happens on twitter and gov forums and youtube videos
351186,one of many reasons
351187,thats hilarious so ch has become their worst enemy
351188,the book goes in depth this is pretty mild stuff compared to the rest d how much can you trust a liar

351211,
351212,pls dont ask questions that are so difficult to answer
351213,very interesting to see this process done in public
351214,is ethereum a ponzi then
351215,yep bitcoin too
351216,oh no
351219,
351220,lmao
351221,coping hard
351222,lol found the tokemak founder in a clickbait youtube vid guess he got his exit liq
351223,so is this a compulsory raise from token holders
351224,depends on the contract in 1 if the claim address is an eoa then the contract has to support some kind of permit function
351226,im coping pretty hard tbh
351229,that yt vid is pretty insane lmao rich people happily sharing their alpha
351230,oh here we go again ahah
351231,the real ponzis are the friends we made along the way ivangbi
351232,
351233,ah yes monkey faces are the biggest threats to society in a nation with 800mil people facing chronic hunger great use of my tax monies
351234,its amazing to see how idiocy is the refuge of every incompetent goverment
351235,across the world
351236,
351237,although the use of the term nft seems very clickbaity
351238,focus does seem to be on ai and 3d printing
351239,india is the current chair of unsc counter terrorism panel amd they have identified monkey jpegs as the biggest threat
351240,okay not relevant for the chat here so lets wrap up before ivangbi boots us all out
351241,lol the article about tokemak below that tweet also has some good points about whether tokemak can ever be as good at market making as a traditional more actively managed mm i think the jury is out on that however its wrong about the reason for the price action tokemak has been down only for a while mainly because they reduced toke rewards significantly on the single staking pools which made it less attractive to hold and at the same time shut down the uni tokeeth lp pool and phased out toke rewards completely for it over s period of weeks the sushi pool is still there but with reduced rewards leading to massive selling pressure over time from a pool that had 100m liquidity only weeks ago that is the main reason for the price action plus the general market crash reducing inflation and eliminating a redundant pool is good in the long term but in the short term obviously has tanked the price hard
351242,is it playable already
351243,shouldve used toke for their liquidity
351244,on alpha test and inside engine metamask tests
351245,if the protocol is not making equivalent revenue to cover emissions this is a ponzii always thought the vc model of profits later smelled bad
351246,thats a stupid definition of ponzi
351247,agreed
351248,which ledger do you secure your assets with
351249,but there was one raise at some point sino global capital has published a thesis
351267,yeah so i guess venture capitalists were all investing in ponzis in web2 buying equity before cash flow positive
351269,apparently so
351272,the things we got away with at deutsche banklehmanbony
351273,two scams dont make a right
351275,agreed just pointing out that the issue is more broad than some narratives try to make it
351276,hey you with a ledger do you use the ledger live desktop and ios apps or
351277,yeah 3ac also did it and now devs did something
351278,not just this ser adam is one of the cofounders he is also raising from plebs now with 25k ticket size thats their website landing page presaleeeee
351279,
351280,sad to see softbank not leading the round maybe they will join later at like 100b val
351282,well as we still unfortunately see with a lot of cryptodefi projects over spending isnt scrutinized as much as it should be so he may fit right in
351283,anyone have thoughts on solana developer ecosystem vs the ethereum developer ecosystemas an eth guy im watching all these sol hacker houses and am honestly very impressed
351284,
351285,dont spread misinfo like a pleb sers
351286,sup guys
351287,guys what language and blockchain is worth learning for development ps im a complete noob and have never programmed i just want to try it out
351288,i love eth but shouldnt i learn something new straight away
351289,no demo means choose the right chat ser nft_avenue forwarded there redacted from here
351290,thanks for always pointing fud and misinfo out ivan like i do often miss thihgs like these myself and youre rational at that
351291,
351294,what do i need to do lol
351313,never the goal they only made billions from their token
351314,
351315,dose anyone fulfilled the optimism airdrop standart
351316,lol i really hope not too many people believe this eventual profitability is extremely important for successful businesses that uber chose to be unprofitable to grow faster was a strategic decision
351317,exits require large revenue
351318,uber is hardly an exception
351319,uber has insane revenue
351320,this is not comparable at all lol i cant even believe this is a discussion
351321,and whatever you think of uber ive been skeptical over the years too that they can really become highly profitable all that means is its valuation drops
351322,why do you think im responding to the revenue comment
351323,sorry it was a random comment in reference to nothing else said before
351324,bad assumption to think you were responding to me lol
351325,or you could read the first word
351326,uber
351327,lol
351328,am i missing something
351329,well inflated ipos wont be as inflated anymore if everything is in permanent dips
351330,the title of the article
351331,maybe there would less mental gymnastics if certain people didnt fool themselves into thinking crypto is stock market but now with 100 more brockshane
351332,im not worried about the ipo or web2 market how it works is clear business makes money shares go up in value how business works in general what im wondering about more is the web3 models because at the end of the day theyre all businesses that need to sustain themselvesselling tokens i get it lots of money token may become illiquid eventually but at least its moneyselling nfts sold a product i get itbut then theres so much random stuff out there like poap and a 1000 others that i just dont get at all poap raised 10m for example i guess the hope is it eventually becomes profitable somehow once big enoughand i have nothing against grants and funding either
351333,unprofitable still dont understand what youre trying to get at but ok
351334,i am pretty sure nowadays most shares go up in value because businesses may make money in the future
351335,your own post where you insinuate uber is some sort of exception wrt profitability its nothing of the sort
351336,and i couldnt care less about uber in and of itself thats irrelevant
351337,any sources to understand why bancor fell behind uniswap and sushiswap despite having ample capital and tech googling just brings up old article from 2019
351338,they launched in a time when the market was more interested in the next profitable ico than anything usefuland when the bottom fell out and the market started look for use the market was more concerned with pretending tokens were in and of themselves the spawn of the devil therefore bad and why dont you just use etherand when that was no longer so fashionable well here we are we seem to be going back to 2 though fun times
351339,tldr they were not lucky
351340,there are 1000s of profitable public companies uber is on the more extreme end of the spectrum but the real point is that it could have chosen to be profitable a long time ago revenue matters more here and cursory glance at a business from the outside like this is pretty meaningless
351341,one of the reasons was that they forced bnt on people to do the swaps i believe
351342,the end of spectrum that uber is in also have insane amount of invested in them tho magic leap for example has raised more than 35 billion without a working product
351343,magicleap also a crazy story
351344,like i can understand it goal was to make money not following too closely but i assume its a huge l
351345,but doesnt tell me a whole bunch about web3 startups
351346,the buts are nice interesting though
351347,they raised 500 mil again last year
351348,whatever the ls are doesnt really seem to factor in with their investors
351349,amazon wasnt proftiable for like 20 years or so but they chose not to be same for many companies something basically all public companies have in common is good revenue and likely could be profitable if they wanted to be and the vast majority are
351350,the vast majority are profitable
351351,part of that one is that they had a fixed cost and would be profitable at a certain size so once they grew enough they would be a market leader i think that one was only partly choice
351352,look up s and p 500 go through them one by one and check their profits
351353,it was more just reinvesting profits into growth which makes a lot of sense
351354,you have to dig into a companys financial statements and know their strategy to know whats going on
351355,which is it sp500 or vast majority of public companies
351356,i think its more than that if they didnt reinvest they would have failed but havent verified that myself
351357,i mean if they can turn it around thats good so far 35b invested an extra 500m isnt crazy amounts what was crazy was how the company could raise so much before any sort of product market fit this is highly unusual but at this point the company has invested billions into r and d and 8 years of effort
351358,its really not relevant to anything if you want to look up regular businesses and how they operate you can do that
351359,lol
351360,about amazon this is from 8 years ago before they were profitableall of this brings us back to the beginning amazons business is delivering very rapid revenue growth but not accumulating any surplus cash or profits because every penny of cash is being ploughed back into expanding the business further but this is not because any given business runs permanently at a loss it is because the profits from what is already there are spent on making new businesses
351361,still curious about the original question if there are resources that are helpful
351362,there is a certain irony in watching a discussion that starts by disagreeing with what is essentially theres more to the equation than profitability circle back to more or less the same conclusion but i digress
351363,but most of the companies that have raised billions in the last few years from investors dont have any significant amount of revenue to justify it most probably all of them except epic doesnt even have a sustainable revenue model
351364,eventual profitability is important thats how businesses are valued short term speculation has an impact long term this doesnt hold water revenue and other metrics for a business are extremely important and just looking at the numbers from the outside provides very little insight into the amount of profit a company will generate in the next 20 years
351365,of course
351366,just not true thoughthere are bets like magicleap that are the extreme exceptions the market has been flowing with cash these past few years not saying the 70b valuation uber once had made sensebut overall non web3 businesses are pretty easy to understand
351367,its important in all this to resist conflating businesses at different stages which have different players involved with different incentives
351368,then the differences need to be explained
351369,early stage startups get 20m valuations they cant exit at that but the reason the valuation may make sense is if they have a 10 chance of becoming worth 1b or a 50x return then the investment is highly profitable ofc the real numbers are different and it might be a 01 chance and then the bet doesnt make sense then its ev
351370,wework was losing billions a year even before their scandal and still managed to raise like 15 billions in private funding i was recently looking at articulate raised around 15 billion with only 80 million in revenue
351371,despite all the hand wringing about the rich its my understanding that most vc firms lose money on average so yeah super high risk
351372,coworking businesses are extremely extremely profitable they had high up front costs despite taking a massive hit to their 50b expected valuation a few years back its a super good businesses that is worth 10b for a reason
351373,high risk high reward a good vc needs to return 3x or so the capital invested many are unprofitable long term angels as well in recent times many are likely profitable due to overinflated paper valuations but ya longer term sp500 is a much safer bet
351374,this all goes for web3 startups too a tonne of it backed by vc fundssome is understandablealchemyinfura charge you a monthly feenansenicy tools charge you a monthly feemetamask takes a big cut on swapsopensealooksrare take 225 on tradesbinancecoinbase make money on tradesnft creators make money selling nfts artaccessgamestokens are a world of their own where it seems many dont have a good model but a v small minority doall of these are pretty understandable and sustainable and then theres a tonne of others out there that just seem totally wild and just dont get how they keep going
351375,the tie to crypto is that most successful investors in both arenas made most of their profit on 1 play looks like a power curve theres no sp 500 in crypto theyre just not comparable yet btc isnt even near gold so traditional retail investment isnt applicable to crypto closer to angel investing at a casino
351376,perhaps that is what this fellow did
351377,lol i think the rest are just beanie babies like you said without a future
351378,im curious whats an example of this other
351380,what happened with yfii
351381,exploit
351382,why tf is now yfi dumping
351383,oh man
351384,plebs think yfi is the same
351387,when vc sell 5 it is the vc fault that tank the price when devs sell 10 sorry guys we need funds plebs logic
351393,firstmargincall use ctrlf for a lot of legal and tax questions moreover this research chat is not for them if you have the lobsterdao nft you might discuss this in that chat as its more for investments alpha such stuff
351394,it was posted a lot on twitter if i am not wrong
351395,so why shares goes down rapidly in value when business still make money its never about value its about speculation revenue of some companies dropped by 5 but shares dumped by 50 there is no logic here shares gone up that far because of fed printing historical amount of money and injected them into the markets enormous amount of retail money that was stuck during covid it has nothing to do with any revenue logic you afe trying to apply there are companies that go to ipo spacs and whatanot just to cash out
351399,its all about speculation but its a question of what is being speculated on are you speculating on future revenue based on fundamentals and therefore dividend growthdecline or are you speculating on twitter shills doing a betterworse job at bringing in greater fools into the asset
351400,fed and other macro factors are still fundamentals since the asset youre holding isnt a companyproject working in a vacuum
351401,not saying one way of speculation is better than the other obviously the most profitable is the best i would just argue that its a lot easier to speculate profitably based on objective measurable facts and data on the long term
351402,well i didnt refer to crypto as from few years in market i cant say im expert but i know something and crypto is the most high beta risk assets which is scarce until its not hence pumps the hardest psychology of market applies in the best possible way into crypto just like early dot com bubble stonks and hence we still have that psychological model of euphoria and fear working here
351403,thats assuming pumps are the ultimate goal pumps are useless if theyre almost always followed by a dump and you have to somehow time your entries and exits right
351404,instead if youre in an asset that is steadly growing revenue or potential for profit for years you dont have to time entriesexits
351405,basically if the asset is continuously making more money to holders at some point there will be some pe ratio floor and dividends will bring up mc with it
351406,nfa
351407,at that point do you even really wanna sell tho
351408,basically if the asset is continuously making more money to holdersheh such blatant disregard for howey
351409,even if its still makes revenue in crypto general sentiment is much more powerful and hence overall market just need to purge all the crap
351410,not disregard many crypto projects are securities whether they admit it or not
351411,you got an example for this aside maybe btceth that just dump less then they pump in htf
351412,lol i suppose the lawyers will eventually have their day
351413,general sentiment is more powerful within short timeframes long term speculation is almost always on fundamentals
351414,whats the best protocol right now in terms of revenue distribution curve compound
351415,just to be clear revenue distribution isnt profit if the asset is deflating at a higher rate
351416,that aside isnt that you make money for me because im holding a token behavior the source of most problems in this space
351417,because your mc share and therefore your revenue share is constantly diluted
351418,to be really profitable a protocol should accrue more value to holders than it dilutes them
351419,imo maker is the only such case in crypto 0 dilution continuous buyback and burns
351420,depends on whether the project is at a state where it has grown sufficiently to grow healthily while accruing value to holders
351421,yet its almost always the example of a good working product with almost no value accrual to itself
351422,its a bad value accrual method but it is still a profitable asset if not really the only one i hold no mkr btw
351423,hence maker never pumped
351424,sure but what happens if dai grows even further for every dai in existence maker continuously earns interest
351425,this applies to all debtbacked stablecoin providers
351426,im not sure if anything healthy can come out of that relationship unless you are extremely selective of who you let hold the token or by hook or crook have it concentrate into hands youre familiar with mkr wasis infamously the most concentrated token out there only bested by eos at the time
351427,imo token holders are owners of the asset there is no relationship to be made with the protocol or the core team they own the whole operation and hire the team
351428,eg in maker governance has successfully executed facilitator offboarding proposals and fired people by onchain votes
351429,this is why i always say snapshot voting isnt governance because then core team becomes gatekeepers and ownership is taken from holders
351430,true in idealistic theory naive in practice
351431,works in practice when you have onchain gov hiring and funding everything
351432,this i fully agree with few protocols where the team basically denies governance by not allowing snapshot votes to happen
351433,more like true until you do something that forces the hand of people that actually control the token its dead in the water for the same reason you cant get rid of zuck
351434,hey been searching for it for a while but ctrlf fails there was this talk about a wallet that allows one to share his wallet keys with someone in a way that can be revoked what was that
351435,sure but youre still coowners receiving the same benefits and aligned with the same incentives
351436,nan
351437,cap lobster in the room
351438,is dis nemo
351439,yes
351441,great talk about lobsterdao and its history ill stop shilling now
351442,hahah nice
351443,ncerovac i think you forgot to wear your shoes there
351444,wait u saying that whiteheart purpose was actually to work as an options platform and not to just extract moneys for mollythescamdev and rekt those who gave herhimthempronoun said moneys
351445,no shoes channeling his inner andre
351446,
351447,i feel like people here are way too short term focused or used to speculation in crypto long term value investors like warren buffett do extremely well ultimately businesses are valued by their profitability long term
351448,i feel like you are boomer warren buffet is massively underwater on his apple buys
351449,lowkey getting the vibes but dont wanna offend or argue w elie55 so lets put this convo to bed now
351450,in general subjective couch philosopher stuff like this this was ok though but was crossing the line is a bit too gibberish for the chat anyway
351451,hahaha i wqs nervous and slippers were irritating me so i took em off
351452,yeah is of okeeeeehh we know the real reason
351455,mirror had stocks some and then synthetix kwenta maybe thats it
351457,coine_r imho screw every foundation doing their own proposal idk why not interesting just marketing larp
351458,
351459,they trying to raise or closed already if just started idk how easy it will be for them to get the 45 for crypto
351461,
351462,oops theyve done it
351463,cool thats what 05 do kwons
351465,total 76b fund 076 do kwons
351466,they were raising in jan closed already
351467,thx damn lol
351468,such pr is made when the fund is already 80 commited not when they are starting to raise
351469,thats very true
351470,fair play will help web3 as a whole for long term aligned investors to have the capital to invest instead of quick invest dumpers
351471,does the mention of regenerative finance in a16zs blog post refer to this
351472,valuations go boom on 321
351473,a16z rebranding as softbank
351474,theyre already on it
351475,story sponsored love the vibe
351476,hello techcrunch wtf did u post we will buy you out a16z
351477,check out kleiner perkins and the tragedy of cleantech venture capital how cleantech tarnished kleiner and vc star john doerr how the kleiner perkins empire fell fortunemay be similar headlines on a16z and crypto will come in a decade
351478,plz explain me smart people if im wrong here1 vc fund is small and doing first successful investments and exits its happening with the risk of vc partners own money in the beginningthis is genesis stage2 vc fund has media coverage influencers programs this is reputation stage3 vc fund changing its model from we re risking our money to we re risking rich plebs money why because they are creating new and new funds each time and now their business model is from raisedinvested funds this is softbank stage during this stage vc is actually interested in pumping evaluations for everything they are touching they have no exposure to the success or fail they just service maximizing capsnoiseright
351479,yes to me but i am pleb
351480,would be nice to have a list of those at softbank stage
351481,4 raise new funds v2 v3 etc to pump the projects from the former fund so fund 3 pumps fund 2 valuations etc
351482,not all vcs start with personal money not very hard to raise a 25m first fund if in the right circles and good background many start as scouts or partners at a large fund and then branch out to start their own fund but yeah the goal for many vcs is to raise their 3rd or 4th fund where 2 of aum for 12 yrs is enough to retire
351483,can someone tell me if i am dumb or there is free luna airdrop to be claimed be me1 buy 10000 worth of ust now send it to terra and wait for snapshot send back if worth something2 short 10000 of ustperp on ftx3 get free lunav2 airdropfin
351484,you probably explained vcs in easier way compared to many who try and write down infinite substack posts
351485,2 charged annually therefore 24 of aum
351486,mgmt fee is usually 2 pa for investment period 5 yrs dropping to 175 and 15 over the remaining 5 to 7 yrs and carry of 20 of profits increased to 30 once 2x3x capital has been returned
351487,wont you be paying funding though
351488,funding is lost yea but its marginal
351489,is the snapshot very soon with a declared time
351490,yes snapshot is confirmed for may 27th with exact time
351491,agtsi cant you also just borrow ust from ftx
351492,instead of buying and shorting
351493,i think the question is more where tf are they gonna deploy it it seems they are so well capitalized and just doing dapp seed rounds is not gonna cut it for them anymorei think they are gonna try to make a move and prop up a new l1 and go for a home run e g alameda with sol 3ac with solunavax jump with lunasol etc find a new promising l1 with a different narrative eg developer friendly think flow etc and fund the living shit out of the ecosystem and make a gazillion dollars the next cycle
351494,will check it out my scenario makes sense right
351495,dont you think there will be dozens of new chains new cycle
351496,flow is actually good example
351497,i hope dapp specific chains finally take off cosmos had such promise
351498,they are in invested in it already packy had a long piece spinning up a narrative about flow as well developer friendly normie blockchain etc etc
351499,inb4 a16z invested in celestia headlines
351500,yeah they fcked up with nbatopshots and never recovered from that continous huge unlocks
351501,
351502,why do they need money again for pol pools or what the idea why
351505,wdym raising because they can
351506,looks like borrowing cost is 10 per day atm
351507,how does one triple a valuation in 1 qtr
351508,does anyone know a vscode extension that allows to more efficiently analyze the bytecode of a solidity contract i want to do some changes and see how the bytecode changes between iterations sort of a builtin diff for bytecode between iterations if that makes sense edit opcodes would also help

351513,check this out
351514,not to shit on this but be particulary mindful of what you install on your ide things that have access to environment files
351515,good point maybe we should look through the code of the extension i saw it on someones twitter
351516,
351517,im in my early 30s if age mattersobviously buffett not a tech investor and doesnt understand it but some of the comments have been laughable i guess this what a few years of meme coins and meme stocks does to people
351519,
351520,i might be blind but i dont see where it is stated that 10000 ust will be eligible for an airdrop could you share link to the comment
351521,i simply used 10000 ust as an example final proposal is here
351522,i see thanks i thought that they put a cap or something
351523,
351524,nan
351526,my instinct is that theyre thinking about themselves and how they enter the market not about how they push us outon a level playing field cefi doesnt stay cefi
351527,ie this isnt about swooping in and taking over its about using custodial services to deploy their assets to crypto because they want to do so in a way thats compliant with the regulations they have to abide by being cefi theyre the ones with their hands tied
351528,all chris blec does is get post shit in bad faith and never present a solution hes engagement farming and really good at it why do yall pay any attention to him
351529,18888 memberschecked
351530,like a half bots likely but a lot real
351531,and never present a solutionwhere did you get the idea this is required
351532,general rule of anything buildingrelated if u wanna shit on my idea suggest yours as an alternative or gfy
351533,mirin those digits
351534,not sure if trolling or serious but that makes as much sense as the guys that told me i couldnt criticize bitconnectcardano because i wasnt holding it
351535,depending on whether u criticize a working product and wanna make it better or a ponzi scam
351536,if u r a cry wolf then youll likely be right one day same as yes btc will crash 50 true after it goes to 60k firs
351537,neither requires you present a better solution though all that does is excuse mediocrity because what dont hurt my feelings
351538,
351539,nan
351540,its more like just not being an asshole say your idea is shit go ahead but tell them why and what can be done to improve it you might even like the consequence
351541,has anyone ever heard of protofire dao kinda similar to what the defi wonderland peeps do except they dont have pepo and other awesome animals with their amazing knowledge
351542,it isnt a dao

351569,every single thing in our human existence could be improved so mediocrity is the natural state of things at all times stating the obvious without doing anything about it is the least someone can do totally criticize cardano and bitconnect since we have better alternatives already like literally any working product haha
351572,imagine if we could only speak when we find a solution seems like a total waste of energy collaborative work is going to include moments where people are chasing down a thread of thought that together with others they flesh out into something tangible maybe from a complaint or criticismi suppose the sheer number of complaiooors and haters means we throw people with good intentions out with the bathwater so to speak but we become weaker by doing so

351646,ok in my case i was hacked and stolen it is good reason to contact law enforcement but thanks anyway
351647,ip address at best tells you isp but youll get no other information without a warrantcourt order and if they were using vpn then likely untraceablesignificantly harder to track
351648,so report to law enforcement
351650,thanks for your help and sorry for out of topic question

351683,just in metamaskhas partnered withasset reality an endtoend solution for recovering seized crypto assetswatcherguru
351684,asset reality is the worlds first endtoend solution for complex assets its platform provides services and tools to public and private sector companies investigating managing and recovering assetsfrom helping crypto companies support victims of fraud to enabling governments to manage and realise portfolios of seized assets its mission is to improve asset recovery for victims and society
351685,as in they just have a backup copy of your seed and help sieze your assets if governmentprivate sector thinks youre a fraud
351688,is there a reason to believe thats what they do
351690,still better than most fiat though
351691,
351692,cant wait to dump this one
351693,no link for the eligibility tho
351694,see the thread he mentions eligibility checking is not yet available
351695,no solidly users airdrop nice
351702,grab your share of the 45 billion frens
351703,noice to know there are bargains and not just garbage
351709,valuations normal now like 20m seed rd instead of 50m seed
351712,lets support the builders
351719,so can anyone explain the testnet merge attack
351720,what happened probably wont matter because real chain is lot more competitive but is their anything to worry about
351721,how can i use graphqlcodegen with a schema from a subgraph on thegraph right now when i run it i getfailed to load schema for graphqlschemajson failed to load schema from srcschemasschemagraphql unknown type bigdecimal error unknown type bigdecimalwhere do thegraph subnets get the types from i saw the package graphprotocolgraphts but its very confusing
351722,from a subgraph
351723,you just need an abi
351724,sorry afaik codegen generates the generated folder correcting myself
351725,lets say ive got this
351726,and i wanna run graphqlcodegen in order to get myself typescript types
351727,how would i do that
351728,you should really read the graphs documentation honestly graphs implemantation are not straight forward and it looks like you still need to understand some basics on that topic so start from the basics maybe and then scale into executing that
351729,this has nothing to do with graphqlcodegen afaik i might be wrong here
351730,ahhh hit me with the rtfm
351731,
351732,yeap specially because for real implementing a subgraph is not that straight forward its a kind of weird typescript that gets transpiled to wasm with a lot of weird intricancies
351733,oh im not implementing a subgraph though i want to consume one
351734,id like to be able to have the rich typescript types as i query the uniswap subgraph using graphqlrequest or apollo
351735,you should be able to just clone this and yarn codegen and that is it
351736,ohhhh omfg i just understood what you want to achieve lmao
351737,im definitely a graph rookie both graphql and thegraph so apologies for not using the correct terminology and such
351738,hello im new here just finished reading this
351739,amazing community
351741,
351742,everyone bera market makes me pain fatman i have a new investigation source some anon twitter accs
351746,hmm there was a question about the popularity of rust programming language but it was deleted anyway heres a good source of insight although whether it will be a c killer is subjective worth noting that new languages ded languages pay very well if youre prepared to travel
351747,
351748,uni holders get nothing of this
351749,if so thats kinda fraud jfc
351750,they can get a thread a year later saying uniswap didnt add enough value staying true to tradition from meritcircle what more do u want
351751,so does that value accrue to equity holders doesnt feel right
351752,thread value accrues to elon musk if he can manage to get his margin loan
351753,always has been
351754,just one gov away for fees sharing
351755,oef that phrase hits hard
351756,nan
351757,the bait is never old especially with uni dydx
351758,how could you ivannnnn
351759,i cant understand how it is more legal to print shitcoins from the dao trust entity to make your normal company earn 9 fig on a casino while it is not legal to make dao decide to earn fees actually i wanna tweet this mr researchers dogetoshi lawmaster10 is this factually correct or no
351760,i rmb they make 2 company the fees belong to the foundation not protocol gov
351761,yes thats what i was trying to meme
351762,a multiple company setup is regular its to split operational legal etc responsibilities but to literally brrr a shitcoin to make equity moon idk i hope they donate it all to tokendao later
351763,one is good for institutionals the other is good for retail guess who is favored by regulations
351766,gang whats the best source to learn about reentrancy attacks and how to code against them
351767,
351768,if you want something more handson
351769,nice thanks
351770,you can just check the chain for this oneno need to trust a source
351771,bruh30m raise in this environment
351772,a raise for investment clubs aka more raises to be exact
351773,the fact that uni ventures was formed to better invest and then promptly invested in a protocol to encourage more investing is uhsomething
351774,metamask has announced that it will attempt to aid users who fall prey to cryptorelated scams and phishing attacks in their quests to recoup lost or stolen assetsread more
351775,everybody want to become vc nobody want to build ser
351776,false
351777,i implied satire
351778,anyone has contact with terras core team one exchange in argentina is asking for the contact because they are afraid they wont be whitelisted for the redemption plan or maybe someone that could help on this matter
351779,maybe the dev chatroom
351780,link blz 3
351781,check pm
351782,pleb question can someone expand on the 7 block reorg implications on eth was it on testnet what does it causes to the money that was in those blocks
351783,most vcs will be back on the street in 2 years
351784,it was on beacon chain
351785,are there any good starting points to implement a gas efficient employee vesting contractbeside the yearnvestioingescrow and badgers smartvesting which were mentioned here a while ago
351786,linear vesting
351787,see lines 46 to 86 for very simple but flexible linear vesting edited
351788,nice report
351789,yes linear vesting
351790,i cant access that
351791,oof my bad
351792,
351793,dropping this here for people interested in onchain governance verification based on uniswaps original seatbelt but we added some new things apart from make it aavecompatible
351794,remind the pleb how to check unlock permissions given
351796,
351797,
351798,hes been a little controversial with his conspiracy theories but this thread is pretty significant imo
351799,fatman fatmanterra13hin one transaction the attacker turned 10000 into 4300000 this was actually done several times generating a total of well over 30m all of this went completely unnoticed by tfl and the mirror team community this is the first time this attack has been revealed 1112
351800,solanas blockchain clock loses track of time now running 30 minutes behind
351801,can devs use this
351802,all these blockchains and we cant even keep trackof 30mil
351803,tfw a timechain loses track of time
351804,the blockchain is now in flow state
351806,great read im impressed that celsius actually made money this time
351807,
351808,nan
351809,if its out of thin air wouldnt that basically be the azeem situation
351810,oh damn i forgot to rectify i think they are backed by usdc
351811,
351812,hya am i supposed to have methods autocompleted from my passed abi file here typechais were generated successfully but for some reason i still have to type in everything manually same for contract object
351813,nan
351814,nan
351815,
351816,it was so evident that this pos model will lead to cetralisation omg
351817,this isnt final form dot sol etc have much higher staking rate we will see atleast 2x current eth staked post merge
351818,what if centralization is the most stable design evidence jesus is real
351819,federal reserve wants to hire you
351820,food for thought tbh
351821,but its okay because mass adoption and stuff
351822,i mean theres freedom in having your soul boundor u could always use a new address
351823,what is a man with no soul
351824,a bored ape not talking about the nft no pun intended
351825,how are soulbound tokens addressing privacy wheres the best write up on this
351826,its just another form of token
351827,no one can stop it from existing
351828,
351829,toe the line
351830,does anyone know of or have a resource on altchain network outages
351831,just get new address 5head
351832,yeah i see two diverging paths privacy self sovereignty and then open source auditable trackable data for everyone
351833,not sure which narrative will prevail if theres a happy medium or what
351834,why are crypto funds so interested in wasm
351835,is there going to be wasm x instead of solidity soon or what
351836,
351838,thanks for the shoutout it appears even uniswap isnt aware that gelato is seperate from arrakis now are they seperate lol nobody can tell if they are
351839,but federal statutes passed in the 1930s deputize ordinary investors to help the sec do its job by giving buyers of unregistered securities the right to sue the seller for their money back
351840,3 will be like 50 of the initial spice supply so might be quite interesting and depending on how many gel are locked you may get quite a bunch of spice
351841,which will be diluted by orders of magnitude by internal farming rewards going mostly to whales and insiders which should help compensate nicely for the lack off fees produced due to setting static wide band ranges that dont do anything different then uni v2
351842,farming rewards wont be retroactive and will spread over 7 years
351843,thats another discussion tho
351844,just saying that locking might be quite juicy
351847,
351848,maybe fatman was so wrong about this one after all de fuk
351849,this is so depressing i mean how is luna relaunching it needs to disappear from the face of the earth
351850,no
351851,protect this comrade at all costs
351852,yes the same way that there is freedom in being ruled by the tyranny of your own unconstrained desires
351853,hey guys little tech question is bsc forking a lot lets say vs eth or forking a lot at all does this question even making sense and if yes are there any stats on this im asking to prepare a discussion with a few devs any infos would be really appreciated
351854,relevant
351855,lol i love the idea that vitalik suggesting the idea of a token that cant be transferred has people clutching pearls its just a whitepaper about an idea for a type of smart contract some guy had yall literally any smart contract chain supports soulbound tokens today
351856,i can send you some sbts today if you like on any evm chain i wont because im too lazy to write any solidity today but it would take me twenty minutes to conjure up an erc20 where the only way to get it is to have it minted to you
351857,revolution populi
351858,smart contracts are turing complete you can implement literally anything you want with them if you couldnt implement sbts on a chain it wouldnt be a functional smart contract chain
351859,to me this feels more like vitalik had a random idea and wanted to take it to its logical extent in a paper he also probably wanted to be the first one to actually write that paper so he could make sure that now anyone who does this will use the soul terminology
351860,wouldnt be surprised if that last thing is the only reason he went to the trouble
351861,that paper is a lot more than vitalik had a random idea
351862,and hes not the only author or the most interesting character involved
351865,ok vitalik had a random idea and then wrote about it for like a week
351867,well the writing about it part is new
351869,well we can certainly pretend thats what it is
351871,that stuff is far less vitalik wrote a paper than it is vitalik was involved in glen weyls paper
351872,ah thats fair
351874,you could probably write an entire paper about them
351875,on one hand i think its kind of silly were making such a big deal out of a nontransferable nft it isnt really a new or crazy concept on the other hand it does go to show how someone with a large following and good reputation who comes up with a fitting name and powerful narrative for a simple concept can make it widely adopted and discussed similar to a memecoin in some ways but with actual technically interesting features
351876,even without making it bound for life you could embed hidden data in the nft that links it to its original owner would stand the test of time
351877,id go as far as saying just about the only thing vitalik added to that paper is his name and all the clout that entails and soso technical implementation few people care about glen weyls paper few would bother putting in effort to make excuses for the interesting ideas espoused in it but throw in vitalik et voila
351879,arent voting escrow the same too afaik vecrv is not transferable either
351881,isnt vecrv supposed to decay to zero by the lockup period
351882,yes you can kind of argue that vecrv is like a temporary soulbound token or put in another way you add a time vector into your crv balance and get a soulbound token with new special rights
351883,are lobs whitelisted for a lens handle
351884,
351885,yes if u had lobs nft in the wallet two days ago it was snapshot based
351886,lovely im in
351887,
351888,i know how liked certik is so just wanted to share this
351889,
351890,binance family and friends
351891,yeah incest
351895,a very unpleasant situation happened there is a team perpetual protocol they have two dex exchanges v1 on xdai and v2 on optimism and their token perp top 300 cmcive been trading on v1 exchange for over a year and everything was going great not so long ago eth started to unpeg relatively to other exchanges and remembering that it was not once i increased positions there what was my surprise when in few days exchange was stopped and not allowed to withdraw even free fundsspoiler alameda on one of pairs cream broke amm and because of this everything was stoppedthen held a fake daovoting in which neither i nor any other v1 exchange users could not affect anything where alameda voted as he needed and got his money back while i and many other users were left with six figures minus the team of course is trying to hush up the situation i dont have any pumped up tweets or instagrams so theres no way to make it all publicmore on the situationfound a discussion of the situation vote 1 2 the team supposedly consulted the community the result is that none of the proposals the community was not accepted and they put to vote their optionswhere again users had no control over anythingin the end random token holders decided the fate of the refund in a completely unfair way random holders alamedajust so you understand there was a difference between optionsopt 1 refund of 50k 10 of money opt 2 refund 55k 10 of money opt 3 refund 60k 10 of money opt 4 refund 700k about 90 of moneyfigures are approximateteam does not want to refund anything from their funds not even their own token perp which can be lockedi dont have any public accounts to publicize this situation so i would appreciate it if someone could help
351896,tongnk can elaborate if he wants
351897,so if you read the post theres a fifth decision that was placed and it grouped all community proposals together there was not enough time to collate data for all proposals i think there were like 10secondly perp is used for governance of the protocol and given its a protocol decision it should be voted by the token holders unsure why youd do any other method if you had users vote as per your suggestion then you probably would have received nothing given the largest account could vote and take everythingfinally your percentages are extremely misleading the sum to be distributed is the same for all options just distributed differently amongst accounts
351899,reincarnated soul token
351901,i think a vote will always lead to one of the first options as the biggest users tend to have the biggest vote power thats how governance worksthink the basis problem is rather that a trade protocol doesnt bother to refund people that trade on them and keeps going as people should know that if this happens again they will just let users pay for it again
351904,gm lords of the deep do you know any good examples of defi friendly cexes to my mind most of the cexes want just to rip off the founders of defi protocols founders by selling them a listing on a cex curious if there is anything beside launchpads pooling of assets to depositstake them that cex can offer to the founders of defi protocols
351905,use defi positions as collateral
351906,currently there is proposal for phase 0 drop on optimism from perpetual maybe you could inform wider community there on how perpetual are not being user oriented
351907,you mean kind of nexo credit card which borrows stablecoins against my collateral each time i do a fiat transaction
351908,hi is there any way to know or calcualte the gas spent in certain time period from my address
351909,u can export from etherscan csv and just sum up the last column
351911,it helped thanks
351912,did uniswap ever did gas refunds
351913,1inch still running their gas refund program
351914,want to know any other l1 dapps offering gas refunds spent 45 eth gas fees since jan
351915,paraswap but you need to hold and stake psp
351917,no more like if cex is willing to take uniswap lp positions as collateral
351919,great idea thank you
351922,thanks i have been holding psp but didnt knew it had this utility
351923,
351924,
351925,the issue was validator counts being too low primarily the bridge attack was a consequence so long as the network is fully permissioned does any of this matter theyre running 11 validators now which is 2 more than they had when the attack happened been trying to contact these guys for weeks now to comment on a report but sky mavis are completely impossible to get anything out of
351926,we deserve hell
351927,
351928,its a clever way to provide exit liquity for his tron position using the tron dao reserves sun is nothing if not good at making money
351929,
351930,reject doomerism embrace consumerism
351931,so true right
351932,follow the gamblers i mean consumers
351933,tokenize everything means turning everything into a casino bullish
351934,nan
351935,what happened to us trafi surpassed our rates
351936,
351939,do you have link to full article
351940,has anyone looked into what terra2 actually is yet is it basically just a form of terra1 without ust or is there some actual tech there
351941,its basically the same
351942,just without ust
351943,no new tech as far as i know
351944,whats the point of luna if theres no ust
351945,yet another step in fucking people over as a result of an ego maniac not dancing on the grave its just that trying to hide numbers vest etc is an attempt to defer selling into a few months from now down the line and hope not even hope is over that gamblers might help recover things
351946,thats what i was wondering as well maybe theyll just do the anchor play again but with tether instead and subsidize with luna
351947,yeah especially fucked up to do this without having any audit trail or anything released where those reserves got traded to
351948,emergency cash grab
351949,this
351953,took pic last month and forgot to send it it belongs here
351956,sent it to kingdom where the magic creature belongs 3
351957,fool me once shame on you fool me twice
351958,the dumbest name ever
351959,and you can already do that
351960,what exactly do you mean by accessing only the last 256 blocks are accessible in reality by contracts
351962,you have to have an archive node for this
351963,etherscan is a public facing service so they may not have that data cached etc
351964,the merge is not a new blockchain on the execution layer there wont be any loss of history due to the mergeseparately there are plans to remove old state from the working set of the chain but that still will not prevent anyone from running an archive node with full history by reexecuting the chain
351968,anchor protocol was exploitedteam for some reason updated bluna oracle on classic chain and bluna from classic started to cost as luna on luna2 as a result 40mln ust of bad debt for anchor
351969,anywhere with enough liquidity to dump 800k in ust
351970,yeah its kinda liquid several cex 45mln liquidity on dex 002 is still 200mln cap for 10 billion ust
351971,ready to exchange copyright foran nft lolstill got a video
351972,nan
351973,such cuties
351974,consider glory planet ido launch is 2st june i think it will be worthwhile
351975,
351976,meanwhile anchor up 24 today world makes no sense sometimes
351977,searching for the table of borrowlend protocols and their available collaterals like ethwbtcsteth etcsaw it some time ago lost the link
351978,is it too dangerous to launch a token at the moment without bot protections
351979,sniper bot
351981,we should really start releasing our database and the performance of code auditors
351982,certik has one of the highest rates of hacked protocols total audits to total hacks
351983,but theres a lot of sub data we still need to look at was the contract hacked audited time spent auditing total lines of code in contract is the code brand new
351984,audits dont test everything you need to actually read the audit to see what it tested and what results they found
351985,and make sure that code added after audit didnt introduced new issues
351986,you probably want to go over the code again after the audit if youre lucky you wont be surprised by what you find
351987,
351988,i got a simple heuristic for you
351989,is there a written specification document outlining requirements and expected behaviors that is not inline developer comments
351990,if the answer is no ngmi
351991,layerzero solves this
351993,if it sounds too good to be true it is and no he cant
351994,univ3 yields are quite high but keep in mind youre risking your principal on eth price movements and also you incur very high il on stable pairs
351995,yes and bizzarely most audit firms dont even ask for this
351996,its pretty terrible
351997,
352001,connexant imo
352002,i think celer is slightly cheaper most are around 20 or so as current gas prices
352004,i have a list of addresses that own a specific erc20 on ethereum i want to know which of these addresses have done at least one transaction in the last month on polygon any idea howi was thinking to use polygonscan api
352005,this is the huge onea lot of exploits we find the code audited wasnt we the code deployed
352007,looking back at the bull run it really was a minefield
352008,hi all does anyone use a uniswap swap widget
352009,my god crypto is dumb sometimes luna v2 the cashgrabbening is at a 6b mc
352010,can you short it somewhere
352011,you probably can but i wouldnt underestimate the fundamental value of having convinced a lot of people to buy a ponzi coin feels like a good way to get rekt for not enough upside
352012,polygonscan api is fine for oneoff solutionyou could also try covalenthq or polygon dataset on bigquery
352013,
352014,wow will be interesting to see op launch as well
352015,nan
352016,i just want to eat pizza
352017,is there something funky about the wrapped version of nexus unclear why it is 13 of the price just for being freely tradeable
352018,you can dump it without kyc
352019,only the wrapped version is freely tradable
352020,but could you also unwrap it do kyc and claim the bigger prize
352021,theres also moralis deep index
352022,arent they below their mcr so it would be awhile to install
352023,ah so there is a catch then
352024,yeah and it takes time to unstake once they are above mcr theres a queue to exit theres a limit for how much each person can exit limit is both size per exit and is also limited once it reaches the mcr unstaking takes 3090 days i think dont remember tbh
352025,thank you ser i feel better informed
352026,i should get back to learning more dev rather than speculating on these things
352027,anyone honestly have any idea why nexus gets so much hate i agree their token infrastructure isnt the best but the mutual hasnt operated as a bad actor on any claims have they
352028,they dont get hate product wise unless its related to nonpayouts where people dont read small print its most so bagholders crying rightfully so here
352029,coinstats is completely safe to connect with all my hotcold wallets
352030,connecting doesnt do anything to ur funds except maybe expose ur ip
352031,it is very weird when crypto related websitesservices dont accept crypto payments just fiat
352032,you can sometimes get delta neutral yield like thisdeposit usdc into eulerborrow abc and xyzcreate abcxyz position on uniswapthat way you earn the uniswap yield without being exposed to the underlying quite so much
352033,hypothetically speaking borrow rates will pretty mcuh always be more than the yield from amms
352034,depends on the asset surprisingly theres very little demand right now for shorting long tail assets so borrow volumes on the long tail are low which means interest rates are 0 or low
352035,now the question is whether il borrow cost yield
352036,exactly if token a stays stable and token b goes 50 u lose about 2 in il if deltaneutral hedged it kinda goes parabolic below that though
352037,make sure solidity compiler did not introduce new bugs between versions
352038,longtail assets experience harder il so thats even worse though
352039,yeah but it is not that bad if you dynamically increasedecrease the short to keep up with il
352040,but sure anything yielding less than 2530 becomes tricky to manage
352041,ive been trying to think about a way to do this with euler its costly to do on an individual basis but if there was a pooled short position that dynamically updated the debt
352042,then it might be economical
352043,as a user you would get a share in the debt pool as the position on uniswap changes you need to repay some of debt of asset a and borrow more of asset b
352044,you could even do it without following the uni position independently from your farming position something liketoken drops 50 increase short by 10 token pums 50 decrease short by 10 rough numbersalso because providing a ready strategy might dilute the yields too much
352048,
352049,update on kleros attack
352050,chad upgrade
352051,back again
352053,still funny
352054,sbf
352055,lmfaooooo
352056,does sam confirmed not get bitches tho like you said
352057,he had gisele that one day
352058,tb12 has her everyday tho
352059,memes r okay for lobsterdao kingdom chat here we stick to research get the ugly nft and join
352063,
352064,thinking of aping here yaynay
352065,liquity good
352066,wow they have a ton of integrations
352067,first time i see it so explicit takes note
352069,yes this as well we are tracking all that on historical hacks i hope we can release some stuff for people and play around with end of june
352070,not sure here but arrakis on poly has decent yields afair
352071,there was a project that was exploited this week that certik audited 1 they paid extra 11k for expedited audit in 1 week it took 3 weeks and certik wont refund them the fee 2 a few days after launching their new contract its was exploited though certik directly audited it for such exploits no updates were made to the code 3 when certik was contacted about the expliot they still understand how it happened though it wasnt complex hack certik basically subbing out audits to low quality dev farms at this point they have 0 accountability
352072,anybody able to connect ledger via ledger live to chrome
352073,give me an error all the time
352074,lmao another certik classic
352075,all namebrand
352076,like dre beats
352077,its the most popular not even close to the best quality lol
352079,i could check with our risk manager if youd like work with our database we have a lot of this tracked and id like to open source it
352080,its extremely subjective and changes over time fast auditors quality changes is say every 18 months or so as team members rotate its the same as giving ratings to investors see some personal tldr here
352081,couldnt you limit some this subjectivity by adding time variables that weights audits more based how recently they were done or something
352082,absolutely for auditors u can investors quality changes waaaay too often
352083,transparency should the key which we dont currently have in much of the space if youre getting something audited that secures millions then there should be some background on the auditors experience education previously audited projects etc now its more done by certik not very comprehensive if it was legitimate business world that would never fly in the future it wont either and theyll be more accountability from auditing firms
352084,i agree with this a lot its not easy though for auditors either like edward_f said earlier in the chat the code broken may not have even been reviewed from the auditors cause code was altered after or they werent asked to review the exploited section we definitely want to make it more transparent
352085,and each auditor has there own standard practice for risk assessment code problems that are looked at as serverly risky for one auditing firm could be locked at as moderate from another that makes standardizing our data very difficult taking all their rating and trying to combine it into 1 feels incredibly subjective
352086,and that bothers me cause i want our underwriting to be as objective as possiblethats why i want to open source it for consensus also data backed underwriting would be huge for the defi insurance space standard practice on cost of coverage could help us move away from the price bonding model
352088,what is this our datadatabaseunderwritingetc you keep referring to like a defined thing
352089,sauce plz
352090,check libre defi
352091,youre better off not getting audited than letting certik do it
352092,were building dao2dao insurance protocol one thing were doing is building the database to properly underwrite risk lots of data lots of outputs hopefully the db can help everyone in the space
352093,oasisapp uses it
352094,imo uni v3 lping is kind of pvp so if someone makes a lot others arent
352095,has there ever been a case of actual legit founder exit in crypto not an exit scam but something more palatable where a protocol got either acquired by another protocol
352096,satoshi
352097,satoshi went out to buy milk he will be coming back soon not an exit
352098,xdai acquired by gnosis chain holders were taken care of hermez acquired by polygon not sure how the token swap if any behaved there kain stepped down from active ops of synthetix its still being worked on same goes for andre yearn
352099,voyager bought ethos
352100,i guess should have just researched polygon they did acquire a lot of stuff but thanks xdai suffices the example i was looking for
352101,gem acquired by opensea
352102,i think dharma was a better example as gem never had a private round
352103,did
352104,yeah but for frens
352105,it was never published nor anything else
352106,you thinkn people give private round to enemies
352107,ok makes sense
352108,gotta raise 100m 1b valuation somehow
352109,isnt that what vcs are
352111,oh true true
352112,also tonic finance and inversealtho i think that was just tsnark on the team
352113,member charlie noyes leaking the internal convo of paradigm about 1inchs series b
352117,but that round happened though 180 or so at 15b
352118,yeah but the point remains that people do give private rounds to enemies considering all the history not just that particular message
352120,im not exactly sure what you mean by crypto friendly but i run a few blockchain nodes at contabo and that works nicely
352121,
352122,fun discussion i thought
352123,i recon these dapps who when you open them directly wants to open a mm window to connect your wallet are annoying to me i personally prefer when i have the choice to not connect directly by clicking on a button etc
352124,is there any ethereum crypto wallet thats just a signer
352125,so perhaps the problem is the metamask pop up not the option to immediately connect cuz imagine the opposite if it took you 5 extra clicks to finally connect your wallet to uniswap wed be screaming about how horrible the ux is
352126,yeah horrible ux same goes for dapps that say wrong network and then dont give option to automatically add said chain to your mm expect user to add rpc details manually is beyond stupid
352127,indeed best ones add the rpc for you and dont go blank page if ur not on their obscure chain
352131,
352132,what is an example of a project that did this well
352134,anyone knows why frax crosschain does not work anymore
352135,nan
352136,it is not pop up the crosschain page anymore
352138,they just released good explainer video
352139,are there any successful projects building tradfi qis strategies to generate yield from the market volatilty
352140,hello solidusi wonder can i connect you for possile partnership
352141,can someone check the math on this post and let me know where the error is a lot of users are reporting receiving way less for aust than expected
352142,to some extent youre forced to do this if youre writing fuzzing and invariant tests
352143,so probably some of the larger money market codes have examples of this with their formal verification audits
352144,you only get 30 upfront
352145,im well aware of that
352146,look over the whole thread the thread is saying that the amount received by users that included 30 70 vested was not the correct amount
352148,let alpaca do the hard work for you then
352149,guys a question to the cross chain experts here i have been trying to learn how the bridges work so my question is when i initiate a tx from one chain and send all assets to the bridge address for it to send to my destination address in different chain how exactly does it manage the address because in bridgeterramoney after i initiate a tx from terra chain i cant really see a place where they store the destination address on chain
352150,you can find the recipient address in the event logs on terra
352151,iirc chains will be enumerated with eth l1 being chain 2 for the official terra shuttlebridge
352152,in general the bridges have a escrowmint function you sent tokens into escrow on chain a and get an aquivalent mintunlock on chain b how the information is passed is different from bridge to bridge there are different architectures to do this in practice but the overall mechanism is the same
352153,
352154,
352156,same thing matethey gave us about 30 less than was calculated on the proposal and its not about vestings
352157,is there a good ipfs hosting service one where you can acutally host your website on pinita is slow afalso is there like a service where you can test load speeds around the world for your site
352158,use their premium gatewaysor simply run your own node
352160,arweave works well for this
352161,if your site can be built through something like npm run build you can supply the built folder to arkb and use the arweavenet or arweavedev gateway to access it
352162,for a custom domain theres also options
352163,intresting as i understand i would have to pay some 1 time fee for the files to be hosted forever
352164,yeah thats right
352165,website data is generally very cheap
352166,how much for 1mb worth of data
352167,0004 usd
352168,lol ok and how would the custom domains work
352169,provides a way into arweave hosting with custom domains
352170,spent 5 mins on the site didnt understand anything would love tldr
352171,is your website on github the short of is it that you link your sites github select arweave as the network and go
352172,its just for static websites right admins pls ping if this conv is spamy or irrelevant
352173,the websites can run any js you like call apis etc
352174,im actually not sure of the definition of a non static website these days
352175,you have some kinda backend running code api endpoints
352176,it wont do the whole backend no
352177,itll do the front end
352178,i use arweave as my backend haha
352179,and call it from the site
352180,ok and how does the domain thing work does arweave work with ens
352183,personal gateway seems fast but i tired to browse to site using brave ipfsq and it took forever to load
352184,no itd work with a traditional domain you set your domain records on the merchant side to spherons records
352185,although arweave name service is being built
352186,seems like ethlimo domains arent ready for production either cuz ur just gonna be dependant on the ethlimo endpoint and its probably gonna be slow i wonder when chrome is going to support eth domains i guess its gonna happen whn theres gonna be some fincial incentive behind it prob by people selling web3 services
352187,yeah the endpoint centralization is an issue as is browser support at least we see brave supporting ipfs assumably well see them support other decentralised naming services quicker than chrome
352188,chrome does tho with metamask installed
352189,what if i want to have some kinda of control of the website like the background color does that have to go on chain what would be the solution for dat
352190,yeah but thats from production ready
352191,try entering enseth in chrome rn
352192,either its controlled by js or its controlled via continuous integration with the github repo reupload automatically
352193,the code goes on chain and can react to input
352194,jumps to google
352195,it take us about 50ms for response via the premium gatewayscheck where the request comes from if im not mistaken pinata delivery is from aws useast1also the main issue with ipfs gateways is ttfb if thats not the issue in your case try to breakdown the site to smaller sites
352196,bruh
352197,just tested on ff as well works with just metamask installed yeah obviously dont google it visit it
352198,i dont use mm what im saying is that it just not ready builders arent gonna build on this
352199,i disagree if there is one thing all of crypto has in common its a metamask install its ready and works right now ens linking is very flexible and can lead to decentralised ipfs content or just web2
352200,webdev for testing website perf theres a bunch of these
352201,whats the most comprehensive pricing api for tokens
352202,i dont have mm and its not on anyones main browser on the phone
352203,
352204,
352205,
352206,can someone please explain to me why crypto foundations start a company in zug
352207,adds legitimacy
352209,he should have said that 001 of the lpers that are professionals and know what theyre doing can dodge il
352210,interesting hes surprised a ahem useless withoutuse token is down so much if anything its still too high by a few billion
352211,low tax favorable laws
352212,right but most of the jobs there are remote
352213,if your engineer lives in germany he would still get taxed according to the german laws
352214,does the employer get to pay lower contributions
352215,employer doesnt pay tax
352216,no social contributions etc
352217,hmm
352218,so i assume the employee has to then pay for insurance and pension on their own
352219,ja usually its a payroll construction
352220,is this a universal thing for remote working for another company
352221,the advantage is only for the company
352222,unless the worker lives in ch too
352223,then different cantons have different tax rates
352224,its a pretty generic construction nothing exotic about it
352225,why scoff at 15 tax
352229,so i want to incentivize people doing some anxietydepression vr tasks and economic incentives are required for the science part i want to do it with digital assets and i want it to be transparent people donate and they see it immediately turned into tokens and sent to people
352230,avoiding doing anything with tokens inside germany cuz id get burnt makes sense to create an ag in zug and do the token stuff under it right
352231,do they have stiftung or smth there that is easy to create
352232,trying very hard not to sound couchy here but yes taxation in ch will most definitely be lower than in de on any income the company generates
352233,setting up any swiss company requires someone who lives in ch tho or a fiduciary
352234,not an easy task
352235,i dont actually get any income from this token its just to do these things somewhere where there is an existing legal framework for it
352236,its way more complex than your pick up the phone and set up a delaware inc in 5 minutes and 300
352237,and not get burnt when germany passes laws and punishes u for not following them 5 years before they existed
352238,that does not work if the employee only works for you you have to employ them and make all social security contributions etc
352239,yea i heard this from my lawyers if you are responsible for their livelihood they are no longer freelancers
352240,it has to do with how much of their income comes from you vs other clients
352241,which is why youd go down a payroll construction and shift the burden on them
352242,what do you mean by shift the burden on them
352243,payroll invoices you corp2corp employee is empoyed by the payroll company they handle all the paperwork payroll is usually in the country of residence of the emplyee
352244,yeah that works but its not really any cheaper gives you a tax advantage those services are actually quite pricy it just sucks to employ germans
352245,the net wage of the employee goes down yes its a cost to them as a business you just pay out xhr
352246,enough before ivan wakes up and bans us for being couchy
352247,ive always read the main advantage is better laws regarding privacy and all that less likely the government will seize all the servers hand over data etc recent marketing we store your data on swiss servers whenever possible taxes probably arent as important as long as they arent onerous
352248,curious if ur data is on aws will the gov just directly get it from them
352249,which gov
352250,western ones
352251,us uk germany france
352252,the long arm of the usg has few limits
352253,soso relevant microsoft has stated that per theusa patriot act the us government could have access to the data even if the hosted company is not american and the data resides outside the usa
352254,how do i debug rpc traffic from my browser
352255,i thought i had seen a debuggable metmask somewhere but cant find it anywhere anymore
352256,calls to rpc are logged in network tab in developer tools chromebased browsers
352258,question has there been any sustainable play to earn model yet
352259,another question im struggling to find a valid business model for an interopable metaverse as a consumer the idea is great but as a business why would i want the person to bring their digital stuff to my world and even dev to make that happen when i can sell them another one
352261,anyone know how this isnt selling a security
352262,isnt it by definition unsustainable
352263,i like this question its similar to any open source business model red hat is the goto usually here provide a standard service for free that expands horizontally then sell premium services infrastructure and support to those customers or sell their eyeballs
352267,maybe websites can read config from contracts on optimism its just one infura call away right do you have to buy a special api key for this or can be done without
352268,its basically perpetual options but instead of getting assigned either side of the pair when it hitsu eat il instead for the perpetual exposure hedging it is possible but gets difficult as you take linearly more assignment as it trends towards either edge which means your delta shifts due to high gamma when youre close to the range edgesi do it myself and its decent if you want exposure to spot longs and volatility
352269,not necessarily depending on the jurisdiction the employer isnt obliged to make social security contributions
352270,its specifically about germany
352271,is there any way to find out which exchange a trc address belongs to
352272,not if u are harvesting people for data
352273,meta will probably love playtoearn
352274,do you have any source you can share to better understand this
352275,hi guysme and thiago we are incubating a nocode smart contract solution and need to talk with developers and entrepreneurs to better address our productwe would be very pleased to have a chat with you and know your difficulties and experienceshould you be interested give us a shoutout thanks
352276,
352277,thankfully a big brain has done the work and sold away all our edge for engagement so yeah
352278,at some point u gotta pick fame and glory or money and power thx
352279,nice i was going to post this but actually i think the above thread is better
352280,youre technically usually better off selling options if u want to do lp with no token incentivesbut option pricing in this space has taken a huge shit since dovs so
352281,thank you iandao
352282,dear lobsters im down the rabbit hole at threefoldio tft and would be nice to get feedbacks from frens that have looked at it before if its your case please dm
352283,this seems interesting is it proof of capacity based are you providing compute or storage how do you address the farmers dilemma tldr such systems tend to centralisation
352284,they say its network storage computation
352285,also from the site including the technology page there isnt a lot of depth as to how the tech works
352286,can i dm you dont wanna flood here
352287,hey everyone what is the best way to derive the swap fee in uniswap v3 from the swap event on a pool
352288,is there any way to borrow with aethc as collateal
352292,a job
352293,its somewhat weird but beautiful thing that uni v3 prices its lp based perpetual option similar covered call position by ongoing trading fees
352294,
352295,fyi
352296,collected the future distribution of optimism tokens from projects in one table i will be glad to feedback
352298,one of the biggest learning here was dont rush with the token slapimagine if we realized all of this and then had a token too and then we rekt peopleanyhow if i can suggest to anyone here one thing its postpone the token for your platform as long as possible so u can give yourself a space to asses learn meet your team etc
352299,taking a huge shit from the sell side does this mean buying options might be cost effective now or do you think that before they were overpriced and now its efficient
352300,the tvl and the fee accrual into the lp and the actual covered option things happen to fall into the same profitability band because the market is efficient friend
352301,dov vaults give mms cheap vol because its readily locked capital u cant buy from those vaultsthe only other places a deribit which are european and maybe lyra but lyra also has shit prices
352302,as a retail the only main places i know is deribit and lyrathere are some smaller places like liftmarkets and some i know are doing fun stuff like knock in knock out options but those arent launched
352303,i think you mean deribit vol crush into the auctions weve spent some time digging into this at friktion if youre looking to measure the impact
352304,fair point tho working on permissionless auctions soon open biddingfull article
352305,
352306,dropping this
352307,whitepaper tmr dao fund of funds focused on incubating and investing in investment daos
352308,sir i will love u deeply if you have a market for options psy closed down theirs i think cause their mm either had problems or just wanted more volume in their dovbecause i would love to stop getting fuck by eth whales on eth defi and be a lobster in solana
352309,do u guys have any upcoming vaults that will flip over to covered calls from cash secured puts because the performance on these are to be honest abysmal they barely outperform the market by holding underlyingi love friktion as a service good ui good ux trustable team i understand this is a result of market forces outside of control but most users dont actively manage these instruments and theyre losing money
352310,thanks for the kind feedback ser the wheel is in the immediate backlog right after volt 5 comes out next week
352311,can i do a spam ivan hates me already so im not too worried about the consequences i guess either way defi saver just went live on optimism and arbitrum today with support for aave v3 automation for l2s is in the works already too and weve also got new integrations on l2s lined up alreadylink to announcement tweet
352312,anything cool can be done there anything that could make you more than single digit apy on stables
352313,cant help with any higher yieldapy right now but will try to ping here if any more interesting opportunities show up
352314,cavkie nice flag
352315,which country is it
352316,that level of alpha can be shared only in kingdom after you buy lobster nft
352317,ok i see
352319,can we short it
352320,if you have ideas on what sort of bounties should be done lmk
352321,that is just a fancy way to describe impermanent loss
352323,twitter threads
352327,just send a link with actual info to read
352328,we were awarded as one of the winners
352329,what does that mean are they the winners or are they not how can you have more than one winner
352330,a winner for every track
352331,for every project and so on
352332,we are all going to be billionaires
352333,anyway post redacted u can blz send direct info and not just random shill mistbrown
352334,
352335,im not shillings anything just remind me where they describe the loans as options in a good way
352336,nan
352337,damn where have we seen this before
352338,haha
352339,now any arbitrageur will remind us luna
352341,i dont think sambacha was referring to luna with his comment
352345,so i dont know what he referred to where have we seen it before
352347,wordcel describes il
352350,
352352,predictability stability and efficiencysame goes to singaporebased on your weather and culture preferences i would choose one of these two locations ch or sg
352353,talent lives there its attractive to both normies who want salaries and a safe ride home and also degens who have money to afford zurich night life same reason why top tier projects build on ethereum best of whatever u need
352354,so its not mostly remote workers with the company being established there
352355,also zero capital tax crypto custody at safe vaults rule of law if u get scammed
352356,ive seen a combination of both most ppl actually wanna live there if they can if not looks good on cv till u can
352357,same goes for singapore really depends who your audience is asia or not if you like palm or pine trees around you
352358,so to make a charity or ag there u need someone to live there in the canton or zurich would do
352359,better zg
352360,idk google is your fren
352361,you will have better tax and legal treatment in zg than in zh
352362,thanks guys
352365,is it allowed to drop some points i made on blockchain gaming to receive some feedback
352366,ill go ahead if it breaks the rules just delete it
352370,is there a ethtron bridge for usdt
352371,works for smaller amounts worked well and fast between the other networks they support
352372,used them to bridge usdt or usdc from other networks to conflux
352373,
352374,
352375,okx also most exchanges have erc20trc20 usdt support
352376,
352377,pretty good update always was wondering why all crypto analytics platforms work on postgresql nansenflipsidetokenterminal work that way too web2 was doing that in 2010 and switched to hdfsspark systems after that and i didnt get why we as a crypto industry had to repeat all the errors instead of learning on others mistakes
352378,next step would be just make a wide table with bunch of columns but that would depend on how one wants to build the product
352379,not allweve at santiment never worked on postgresql
352380,nansen uses google bigquery afaik not postgres
352381,
352382,op airdrop 2day never heard of this exchange and lotsa debating in the op discord whether its true or not
352384,never heard of them
352386,haha onramped some eth onto op via their official bridge jeez it was smooth and cheap trx fee 175 usd cant remember ever having a transaction so cheap on eth network
352387,also a trx on op itself is only like 01
352388,op still isnt claimable so relax
352389,its more the question if its an official listing or some fake thing
352390,optimism didnt announce that hence its a fake
352391,lesser known exchanges often list new tokens to attract customers doesnt mean that its fake
352392,nice got hooked on footprint lately because of their ready made dashboards but this looks like a proper multichain way to maintain a dashboard for the project
352393,lobster daily 427 daily recap 30 may1 metamask lacking uxlink link to discussion 2 where is the mistake users less aust than they should have beenlink link to discussion 3 can someone please explain to me why crypto foundations start a company in zuglink to discussion 4 measuring the impact of hidden dex costs link link to discussion 5youre technically usually better off selling options if u want to do lp with no token incentiveslink link to discussion

352400,ty added some articles to my pocket ill have something to dive into on my long flight
352401,is there a portfolio tracker for tax purposes that doesnt suck caveat im in eu tokentax looks nice but seems usonlyon my list to test koinlyio cointrackerio cointrackinginfo zenledgerio rotki
352402,tbh they all suck when it comes to anything beyond relatively simple transactions or ive yet to find one that doesnt require a lot of manual effort to cope with things like impermanent loss yield farming lendingborrowing etc if someone finds one that can do it ideally from a blockchain import then that would be truly amazing
352403,i use myscreenbreakcom and save as pdf if you want an alternativeor use feedly and it imports all as rss

352437,a lot of people doing
352438,unmarshal has separate apis for balancefor all tokens in wallet or single one latest block number
352439,might still be team testing
352440,i dont think so
352441,look at the amount
352442,its trading check uni
352443,yep
352444,they changed the community hub to say its claimable on appoptimismioairdropcheck but its not working for me
352445,tip notice op airdrop 1 is now available to claimclick here to claimairdrop 1 does not require payment
352447,me neither
352448,now its working
352449,hey lobster dao happy to share some news about polkadot and liquid stakingwe at mixbytes just launched lido on polkadot via moonbeamfeel free to ping me and happy to discuss anything related
352450,is that true for univ2 curve too isnt itit is a short gamma to proxy the il expo for univ2 and similar to a short put option or hedged call for the v3 where the strike is where you provide liquidityhow can be the differences between v2 and v3 summirized in options and gamma terms
352451,now my address not eligible like it was on previous web wtf rugged
352452,what is fairness ratio guys
352453,the correct answer is marked in green
352454,who has the merkle root
352455,haha lol
352456,v2 is more basic with no strike its 0 infinityso technically more inefficient in terms of capital efficiency which results in lower fees on eth ethusdc liq is super thicc so u wont get much feesother chains it may still be useful to have lower gamma
352457,actually you can assume to have a kind of a strike considering there is a speed up and down in your il expoin the sense that you wont have the same loss if the btceth for example moves from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 2 difference
352458,i wouldnt say v2s have real strikes you are constantly taking assignment and selling it as the prices goes down and up accordinglyyou are always 50token502ndtoken
352459,il is based on your initial entry
352460,it sort of has strikes at 0 and infinity
352461,what did you do i should be eligible but i have the same issue
352462,right
352463,is there any paper or article about gamma exposure vs univ2 exposure
352464,nothing estrange just connected my wallet delegated and claimed maybe there is an issue with the website for some people
352465,the thing about lping is that the fees only compensate you for the instant changes in price like 12 il is bad when it accumulates and becomes exponential this is why being an active mm in v3 is way better
352466,idk but id be curious in a formal study about it too
352467,do not understand why is better what do you mean by active mm
352468,going in and out of the pools constantly updating your range etc basically being a traditional market maker
352469,il inventory risk in traditional market making
352470,being an lp in v3 and is not always worse than be short gamma on deribit moreover lets say
352471,
352472,is there a way to calculate what is the implied volatility of your lp in v3 and make it easier to compare it with a short put on an perpetual option
352473,jib0xd
352474,apparently team testing im showing as noneligible now
352475,here there is some formulas idk how accurate they are but 20 iv makes sense intuitively that is the premium is way too low
352476,cry emoji
352478,
352479,use the starkgate if u cna guys
352480,eth is full but u can do dai
352481,found this one too
352486,according to their discord it isnt supposed to be life but some people sneaked in during their testing phase
352487,and others claimed straight via the smart contract although for me its not straight forward how they did it
352488,
352489,if someone wants to have a look almost 1400 people claimed already
352490,check his medium
352491,just using an abi and using for example remix
352492,for that they need the merkle proof
352493,right how did they get that
352494,interacting with contract
352495,write delegate maybe
352496,we need a dev guide us
352497,yes already read all of his articles not easy at all if you want to understand formulas and if i remember well they are valid just for univ3 curves
352498,frontend loaded for me to claim just now on 1 of my wallets
352499,can we claim op via contract
352500,they removed a ton of sybills mine too although some of people claiming clearly had multiple wallets
352501,should be possible yes
352502,anyone knows how to speed up your transaction on metamask doesnt seem to allow me to increase gas on optimism
352503,whats the claim link i just see coming soon
352504,i had to change the rpc from the public one to infura
352507,i know i might sound like a noob and in terms of understanding the technical weeds i definitly am but could you elaborate on that
352508,yeah main thing it to get merkle proof so you can provide it in claim function anyone knows how to do that
352509,
352510,contract is unverified tho
352511,prob requires front end interaction correct
352512,you need to be able to interact with contract abi directly without using etherscan
352513,anyone have the contract address
352514,
352515,claim still not working
352516,nan
352517,rats
352518,correct
352519,would you recommend remix for that
352520,hey guys is does anyone maybe have some spare tickets for ethcc paris
352522,when you look at actual data see research of guillaume lambert you realize that average returns are approximately 0 while risk is very high
352525,use ctrlf or ban
352526,how i can iteract
352527,with unverified contracts
352528,re op airdrop
352529,announced 30 minutes ago
352530,yeah so i do not understand why someone above was saying that for mm active liquity providers univ3 works much betteris there any univ2 backtest as well true that as stated in the tweet as well you have a delta positive position so i do not understand why there is no comparison here with respect to holding the 2 tokens instead of lping it
352531,uni v3 is best for jit liquidity providers they are the only ones who make meaningful returns see this research from bancor
352532,jit definition
352533,just in time liquidity providers think people who are hyperconcentrating their liquidity and providing it for just one block when they see a big trade coming in the mempool
352534,note the current version of starkgate alpha doesnt support your browser use chrome to connect what a joke
352535,basically they are extracting value from legit liquidity providers i think someone at the how to dex conference in amsterdam analyzed the volumes and 30 of the total fees are just captured by jit liquidity providersanyway that is why we are trying to build an amm more efficient for lps with swaap
352536,never thought about it it is brilliant
352537,i ll give check it out it is insaneso to sum up for a normal user is there any advantage into providing liquidity in a v3 curve instead of a univ2 on average because i do not really see any advantage after this conversation
352538,for non stable pairs at least
352539,where claim op
352540,personally i have been lping on v2 with no rewards for over a year i like it more than having to clear txs onchain to claim rewards etc
352541,muted for a month
352542,if you are a normal user i wouldnt provide liquidity at all in current amms for non stable pair and i would rather stake my tokens provide liquidity in lending pools the current return risk ratio profile of amms is just very bad unless you add liquidity mining incentives on top of that but thats just ponzinomics when you understand that the product fails to deliver adequate returns to lpsif you really want to lp and you are not a professional active market maker i would definitely go for v2 style amms
352543,on v3 you have offers called clm concentrated liquidity managers like arrakis or gamma strategies that manage your v3 position for you i have not crunched the data myself but it seems that they dont overperform other liquidity providers see amber report
352545,anyone have experience or aware of someone who have been able to wrap an nft collection for owners to bridge their nft to differing chains
352546,in essence the big issue with amms which explains why those strategies dont have a good return risk profile is that they perform two things at the same time price discovery identifying the right price for an asset and market making providing liquidity to an asset pair to make it efficient the fact that they do both of these things at the same time is both their greatest strenghth being able to list any token without relying on any external data but also their greatest weakness they have to pay arbitrageurs to update the prices in the pools and the value extracted is basically impermanent loss
352553,dont send weird op claim links redacting everything dumb
352554,lol ok
352555,it might be correct and safu but risking this makes no sense sowwy socket
352562,yea totally understand
352563,makes perfect sense
352564,safu better than rekt
352565,ivan is not a degen
352567,no market maker in tradfi cefi has a strategy which is amm like this is why i expect amm to rely more and more on external data feeds and more advanced algorithms to have strategies which can actually yield consistent returns for lps this is what we are building at
352568,why all apps on optimism are lagging af jesus
352569,i saw a github for claimming op but i think wait for the op team
352570,op network is lagging like hell
352571,the airdrop
352572,metamask uni 1inch they all are lagging
352573,interface isnt up but the hordes are hitting the contract directly
352574,which i still cant figure out how to do rip
352575,rpc getting hammered
352576,hopefully these well paid vc backed devs had their fair share of valley high profile startups exposure to know how to scale some aws infra
352577,use those vc money for something good
352578,actually works fam just tested it
352579,ok fine adrian confirmed otherwise we email his government
352580,aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
352581,it was sent here like 10min ago but didnt want to keep it unless someone checked no leaking alpha
352582,i know i know thanks vaibhavchellani
352583,thanks for getting me out of banned jail
352584,so it is safu
352585,oh fk u changed ur name jfc
352586,i didnt recognize u haha
352590,does anyone have a private op rpc that is not lagging like hell ankr seems to have skipped this
352591,u can make your own on alchemy
352592,
352593,create an alchemy account and get one for free it worked like a charm for me
352594,
352595,fuck me
352596,87c for a transaction on op
352597,gives me uni airdrop vibes
352598,gross was 1000 gwei that day
352599,back in the day ive found somewhat surprisingly that i have heaps of uni tokens airdropped way after the airdrop so sold then for 30 per uni or something
352600,no regrets
352601,
352602,i can make memes cause i cant use the network
352603,nan
352610,hope ivan wont let such a mess happen w gear
352611,i think a lot of ppl talk about il and stable pairs plus theres not long term data that looks at multiple cycles to determine return of more correlated assets like ethwbtc i know that my uni v3 position had made 1 return yesterday in past 4 daysthough due mostly to eth dumping and pumpingstill better imo than long term just holding btc and eth until next bullrun and dominance starts dropping
352612,if any lobster has a semiprivate rpc that can share my dms are open
352613,i tried the testnet works well they are offering free integration for any existing nft project wanting to go multichain
352614,ok but how can you calculate the be point because i d say that finding it is the interesting part like for options you have your iv you can get the breakeven by multiplying by 1 sqrt 365 and the price and you have to try to beat that implied be with the realized movement right in a amm as an lp your be iv adjust automatically bc you ll receive more as higher volatility will also be consequence of higher swap fees if you can calculate your be point considering a costant ratio between swapfeesbe iv then you can simulate when is worth to partecipate or not as liquidity provider i imagine the market will be adapt and there won t be any statistical aebittage but you can actually make money if the lp is incentivized like for sushi or other dexes with their farm token when you think the risk of farming there is actually low enough in terms of rugexploit
352615,sign up for one with alchemy
352616,if its a low number of transactions you should be cool to use the free one
352617,would love to but currently stuck on a missing flight so not that convinient
352618,if any lobs created one please share via dm
352619,im so confused why you cant go to a website type in an email pick a password and get the free rpc they provide
352620,if you can access an rpc you can access an https website and sign up
352621,youre talking on telegram how can you not use the literal same device to sign up for the service
352622,dont you have to spin up a machine
352623,sign up for one with alchemy
352624,did you read the suggestion
352625,did you ever spin an rpc machine
352628,infura is also an rpc provider that has a free tier
352630,you literally go to the link make an account and it will give you a rpc url to use
352631,takes like 30 seconds
352632,you need credit card details
352633,to get it
352634,no you dont
352635,1 alchemix v2 does not yet support small screens please get a larger screen or resize your browser window2 i dont have an account cause i use a different provider for private rpcs and dont want to create an account just to spin a vm for this
352636,alchemy
352637,and its not a vm
352638,ohh i tried using infura they told me to add a credit card tho
352639,mayen in a hurry i didnt read properly
352640,if your transaction doesnt go through sign up for create new app then choose network as optimism name and all give something you want optimism mainnet then click view keys then you should be able to see https link copy that link and in your metamask change the rpc endpoint url to the one you copied it will be faster the public rpc is very slow right now
352641,
352642,maybe they changed it but i dont have a cc attached to my account and i use infura as my backup rpc
352643,this will help
352644,mmmm
352645,you know whats faster sharing
352646,plus sharing is caring
352647,i can imagine that they might have tightened things up
352648,serrrrr
352649,its free tier
352650,i barely have
352651,its actually not faster most people rightly do not expose their rpc endpoints to the public internet
352652,enough request for myself
352653,
352654,i dmed u one ser just dont share
352655,it will be down in seconds if its shared
352656,i exposed my rpc endpoints to the public internet once and lost 5 figures ask me nothing
352657,
352659,oh wow
352660,was is so hard someone does it and shares it with the community
352661,well yes because that endpoint is going to be pretty much worthless after today
352662,go ahead and use all of those free requests lobsters
352663,be the change you want to see in the world
352664,excellent work
352665,what happend is it because alot of ppl used it and you have to pay for it
352666,no its because the system had a key loaded and someone was able to ask it to submit a transaction with that key
352667,within about 2 minutes of it being open i might add
352668,like i literally opened the port opened the log and watched it say executing eth_sendtransaction for
352669,expensive lesson
352670,most modern ethereum clients dont even have this capability anymore because of this type of issue
352671,its actually a bit risky because part of how agencies like fbi investigate crypto scam is to chase rpc callers and get data from centralised node providers like alchemy i was told this by a founder of a top100 coin which has something to do with privacy
352672,i mean there are tons of reasons not to share
352673,guys its a free account you are helping a lobster navigate these latency heavy times
352674,which is why you want to avoid using things like that that give individual users their own api key
352675,providing liquidity in a volatile pool to share fees and farming rewards in a heavily inflated token is so defi 20 i more than doubled my stack of eth in past 8 months with no risk of il nor diminishing returns from a growing pool chasing the same yield and i always have a direct claim on the eth at contract level without depending on a dao vote or multisig to release funds sure the eth price might tank but i always have access to the underlying eth and my eth stack grows from fees just like irl and not a reward token created expressly for farming which may or may not have lasting value in the future depending on governance revenue intent and ability of founders community strength and a million other factors
352676,ribbondopexanother structured product
352677,thats true although you can compute the il even when liquidity pools did not exist for v2 like amms using this tool for instance on weth wbtc pair impermanent loss reached 479 between 010116 010522 which means you need a 1055 apy to break even today the apy on uni v2 is 26
352678,serious question anyone know why optimism decided to airdrop launch into this rather bad market doesnt seem like there was huge urgency why not wait
352679,i mean its a race for market share atm
352680,and clearly it wasnt working out for them competing with alt l1s without the ability to brrrr
352681,true i have never done it myself but liquidity funds usually price amm positions like options then you can essentially hedge buying another option see crab strategy by opyn for instance but usually the payoff is negative when you cumulate both it can be positive at times especially when the pool is incentivized but what i mean is in the long run those farming opportunities should disappear because the tokens should not accrue much value and the market is starting to realize this
352682,it can be better to launch a token in a bear market because the community will be in green most of the time instead of being in red and fudding
352683,thats a super interesting point actually true uponly if you launch at the bottom
352684,and since they arent raising money the valuation is irrelevant to them
352685,depends on the goals of the project if they only look to pump the price well thats why some of them pospone the launch until idealbetter market conditions
352686,nan
352687,yeah but that really only matters if they are actually trying to ico raise money then obviously valuation matters
352688,isnt that backwards if you dont haveare not getting other money the token matters theoretically quite a bit
352689,
352690,only if they liquidate it though if they were going to give x of the supply away it really doesnt matter at what price
352691,the total supply is 4ish billion right so even with price drop its still at like a 5b mc
352692,cant liquidate anything without a counterparty and its not really a tangible 5b see luna
352696,could you suggest where i can find an abi for unverified contract
352697,speaking about univ2 curve example rightbut if i provide liquidity to an univ2 incentivzed ethusdc pool for instance whats the way to calcultae the right options straddle position to proxy hedge your il moreover you do not have any perpetual option in the market maybe just on ftx no idea
352698,would you elaborate how
352699,i beleive you could use squeeth in theory but i also heard that it appears to be too expensive to be practically useful
352700,that being said if we had an ethusd pool on curve eg without btc hedging would probably be as easy as uni2 or sushi
352701,squeeth historical daily funding 032like thats per day
352702,its almost like uniswap lping is ev or something
352703,squeet
352704,squeeth yeah squared eth the option which has the price designed to follow eth squared which is theoretically good to hedge constantproduct invariants if it wasnt that expensive though
352705,its quite interesting how cheap lps are willing to sell vol for i think a big part of it is lps see it as a way to take profits or dca into assets similar to why a lot of people use ribbon vaults maybe more alternative ways to sell vol like primitive finance makes the market more efficient unsure though
352706,i think im most optimistic for the panoptic finance approach
352707,anyone from ambire is kcc gone
352708,ivogeorgiev i guess
352709,i just realized i posted this here was trying to post to my frens group lol
352710,pls ser how to use it
352711,where are you calculating wethbtc pair years before uniswap existed also i use uni v3 havent used v2 much since v3 came out 17 today on uni v3 pair though thats using defi llama dashboard i would bet its higher in reality would have to check fees vs liquidity in past 24hrs to be sure
352713,its just the impermanent loss that you can calculate since it just depends on the following variables none of which are related to the pool prices of weth wbtc at beginning of the period prices of weth wbtc at end of the period
352714,for v3 your yield essentially depends on your ability to use the right ranges for your liquidity and on average liquidity providers have a neutral to negative payoff it doesnt mean that some dont profit congrats if you do
352715,on average 90 of ppl prob lose money investing in crypto
352716,does anyone know of a toolwebsite that lets you see token amounts in a wallet at a certain time back in history say i want to know the contents at jan 1 2021
352717,what are the tools to check the gas fees i spend till now
352721,
352722,they dont have ssl unsecure connection
352723,hello guys i am new in this group and fortunately i became aware of the group on the blocksplit3 event in croatiacurrently i am writing my bachelor thesis about applications of ethereum in the financial industry to answer the main question which applications of ethereum exist in the financial industry i planned to talk about dapps and defido you guys have any ideas what i can add every link or idea would be very helpful thank you guys your awesome
352724,daaps are decentralizedapps which can be anything not defi related can be social apps or whatever ps this is just a note for the sentence where it seems you put them on the same leveldefi is probably want you want to talk about given you want to talk about financial applications and yes defi protocols have their dapps interfaces to connect and operate with smart contracts basically what defi stuff that you can google for and get a gazillion of articles options lending amms all of the saucesgl
352725,this paper says that defi is 1 out of 9 categories of dapps thats why i will mention it in my main part
352726,
352727,been looking for a timetravel feature like that for ages maybe on lefterisjps rotki roadmap already
352728,re op drop
352729,yeah this is easy as long as you have access to an archive node
352730,couldnt you derive any point in time from token transfers
352731,yeah as long as every token you are interested in has a transfer event spoiler not all do
352732,which tokens arent erc20721 and 1155 has its own form of transfer anyway
352733,off the top of my head all aave tokens
352734,balance changes each block
352735,cool can someone send a link to one of these scs
352736,does it actually change its not just an internal change and then when you withdraw the actual transfer happenssounds pretty annoying
352737,guess when you call balanceof its calculated dynamically
352738,
352739,nan
352740,were do you guys find good projects ever second theres a scam token launched can i get some help finding legit projects
352741,uniswap
352742,checkout the weird erc20 repo
352743,
352744,thanks
352745,i wanna know if theres a project where token value makes any sense beyond speculation i still dont get how we are where we are with an entire world built up on speculation
352746,people think the future is going to be better than the past otherwise we fucked
352747,does uniswap have a document that goes over their contracts and functions i know they have a very thorough test suite but i dont recall them having something like that to give an example what i was thinking about is something like rais geb outline of how the contracts work but with more words specifying expectations and how they function
352748,for example ens no investors so no centralization of holders and no debts governance over the protocol and has a constant revenue from name fees
352749,no investors so no centralization of holdersthat doesnt follow ser
352750,the typical vc funded team has a big allocation for their investors thus centralization of holdersthey need to pay back all that money they get somehow
352751,such centralization exists inspite of vcs
352752,the vcs just give a more acceptable excuse for why its that way
352753,some that havent launched yet
352754,question from anyone doing gaming or xr dev is it realistic now to do web assembly unreal engine or unity how is the user experience
352755,the goal is to have my game inside other games thro a browser without the user having to wait more than 13 seconds for the thing to load
352756,
352757,love me some weth depositswithdrawals
352758,its wrap unwrap guy
352759,
352760,get it cause weth9 uses guy
352761,they have a whitepaper
352762,there is also the audits by here is the audit url link
352763,
352764,something less i need a phd to understand this would be to go and see yearn stratagies
352765,they are typically written out prior to authoring the contracts as part of due diligence
352769,is there some easy to way to calculate liquidation price point on a loan from compound i want to get a usdc loan from coin but am wondering at what price the coin would have to go down to for me to get rekt
352770,thats roughly dependent on your loan to value
352771,yeah right smaller ltv of deposited amount the less likely youll get liquadated
352772,or u can turbo stack your long so it increases your ltvthen youd have to do some extra maths to see when u get fully liquidate inclusive of your loan lolo
352773,35 on coinbase
352782,any luck getting a transfer through to coinbase i sent a few test transactions and nothing showing up in my wallet yet
352783,metamask hardly even recognizes the op network let alone lets me do anything with it not a good first day for op
352784,i used the alchemy rpc and it was still a bitch
352785,i had no problems claiming or sending across wallets transfers to coinbase just seem delayed
352786,ok for me using the one on
352787,can you deposit to coinbase directly from the optimism network
352788,i sent it to one of the exchanges after claiming so i got my coinsnot able to withdraw though now i see op is tradable on coinbase but cant get it there
352789,sign up on alchemy get an optimism rpc
352790,obviously limited but still better than the default
352791,yep same rugged again
352792,i havent been rugged yet in crypto but i think my employer will pretty soon
352793,
352795,gm lobster fam its been a long time since i posted smth here 3 just finished a new article about crypto opsec i hope youll enjoy it officerciamirrorxyzvcuaozkvmw1csanm3vnafrdlx4dwejdiqo6qsoibo8o
352796,
352797,you can probably use this tool weve build to analyse the holders time seriesas an example one interesting eth and not only whalewe even plot it over the asset price for better visual analyses picture attachedas lefterisjp correctly said there are some tokens which are more complicated to time travel
352802,
352803,pretty disappointed of this
352804,how is it possible that we still have this kind of issues
352805,indeed on a web2 part of the infra
352806,
352807,
352808,test before really cannot believe rpc was the bottleneck
352809,hope some good devops will transition to web3 and help on manage traditional infra
352810,i got the airpod for a similar ust amount i cashed out close to depeg
352811,tried to crtl f gro any one know what happened
352812,or just markets being markets
352813,nvm found it
352814,wonder if that is part of their liquidity incentive program but better fine print
352815,this is general stuff that fei_ondo were doing before now i think is frax_ondo
352816,of ondo yes those terms are communicated
352818,the fact that they will dump your token at the end of the day interesting
352819,so they were just a layer on top of anchor
352822,didnt follow the case carefully did users lose a lot of money in their vaults
352825,they match the other side you gib shitcoin they gib stablecoin if end of the day the loan turns out to be less in usd than what they provided they make sure to match it back to keep their stablecoin issuance at par
352826,only logical right they aint taking shitcoin risk cause then they would be a market maker instead they r neutral to the position value at the expense of ur token if it dumps
352828,ondo finance fei were collaborating to provide liquidity as a service to gro protocol by looking at etherscan it seems somewhere between 117 days ago and 97 days ago they ended up with 118m tokens 30 of the circulating supplytoday they dumped all of it on uniswap without knowing more details i would be calling ondo finances management of their treasury more into question than gro protocol
352830,gro is a layer above curveconvex providing a stablecoin vault they have employed other strategies with other protocols in the past
352833,well with ondo one side provides stables and only loses if the volatile asset drops 90
352834,the other junior sides risk
352836,gro is a yield aggregator indeed people using their junior tranche vault product lost funds due to exposure to the ust3crv curve pool whilst the senior pwrd product remained protected and earning interest as designed
352838,logical i dont know i suspect anyone that used ondo based on the storytelling that it was a better alternative to liquidity farming because mercenaries wasnt expecting to be getting in bed with what appears to be an industrial scale oneshot mercenary
352839,i guess 90 protection will work only if shitcoin has liquidity outside ondos market so actually there is no 90 protection ondos tranchess and laas are separate products afak
352841,tbh its stated to projects openly and that is exactly the reason why gearbox members so far did not move forward with ondo the risk of downside when feiondo will be dumping is pretty big as we see with gro their apy they ask for is small much smaller than retail would want and size can be big but ye that clause is a catch
352842,are the clauses public i couldnt find any details in their docs about rebalancing operations or what they do with excess liquidity at the end of a contract
352843,not a nice goodbye to the community when the contract ends
352844,not sure what you mean but i believe ondo is just a mercenary no you pay them x and they provide liquidity where you also add the shitcoins if they have more shitcoins its totally reasonable for them to clear the books
352845,usually the contract gets renewed
352846,happened with alcx a few times
352847,before maturity they renew to lessen the impact however ngl this was rough
352849,yeah seems to me youre better off doing a runofthemill liquidity program
352850,all the posturing about mercenaries bad were better is not even skin deep
352851,tbf im guessing gro had the option to renew the contract which couldve alleviated the problem so in a sense doing feiondo you have multiple ways of preventing the dump either otc with them or other deals
352852,with mercs they just dump relentlessly
352853,sounds like a mercenary with more steps
352854,at least you know the counter party right right
352855,its worse because its a singular party that will dump everything in a single go without any qualms
352856,zomg dirty token just cleaning books
352857,never mind the fact that the dirty tokens are the only thing that makes them relevant
352858,havent been in the talks so cant say what exactly happened and we can only speculate perhaps theyve cleared it with gro perhaps they didnt but this is definitely a bad look for ondo 100 agree
352859,well with ondos recent 225m fundraise on coinlist plus 20m from the round peter thiel was involved in theyre decentralising their product to split it into tranches and offer it to retail
352860,not really or do they just the initial vc loving sale got degens confused apart from that no
352861,i think so when i asked they ondo responded very openly to that
352863,i think the issue most have was that the feitribe token sale was uncapped people aped hard into their governance token and its pretty much been on the downtrend ever since
352865,is there anybody from optimism team l need an urgent help
352866,sorry for the late feedback wow thank you for this great tool is there a way to paste contracts into the asset section im looking for a way to see my different curve pools at dec 31st it seems i can only input tokens i currently have in my wallet
352868,ico price for tribe was 320 and they raised 639000 eth current price of tribe is 023i am guessing a16z coinbase ventures et al paid 0038 since they get 5 of 1bn supply and supplied 19m longterm 4 year vesting lockup though
352869,does anyone have graph optimism token supply from the time for the next 25 years
352870,you can but i sent in first deposit at 35 and after some nice comvos with cb it arrived 4 hours later at 18 although it was done on chain in a matter of seconds quite risky imo at current time still to be trying this
352873,
352874,interested how this will play out
352875,salty people receive token because they used the chain they could do anything they want with their airdrop token
352876,that is an interesting requestwe dont have it right nowtalked with devs they will eventually add it
352877,ngl its silly instead of punishing sellers reward hodlers
352878,kcc is hidden you can select it if you have assets
352879,backwards thinking is f
352880,del
352885,can i confirm it is really an airdrop farmer or some weird shit i dont understand
352887,lol no looks like cex address
352888,hope he will vote against this proposal lol
352889,which cex is it tho
352890,nansen says eth millionaire
352891,by the way how did they manage to get this address for the contract of op 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042
352892,22k addys with the airdrop feels bad man
352893,bybit
352894,confirmed with my recent deposit
352895,ok siryessirdefi blz edit
352896,sad hoped on mega dump good find though
352897,you can do both
352898,when do you draw the line is selling farming rewards not similarly bad why not just 33 or disable sell button all together
352899,anyways i found the top wallet depositing to this address sent 1m op
352900,well is there a good reason for optimism to give tokens to people who arent interested in governance
352901,selling not interested in governance but ofcourse this is pure speculation if i sell now buy back lower to double the stack should i be punished
352902,its an airdrop if youre interested in governance you can buy it later
352903,binance labs closes 500m investment fund to boost blockchain web3 and valuebuilding technologies
352904,well if they wanted a pure governance token why making it transferable
352905,fair point only pointing out that it isnt the most rational thing you can do
352906,for whom
352907,rational from the standpoint that you want to have the biggest op stack for the lowest cost basis
352908,
352909,i think you may be assuming that 0xjohn is a representative from optimism the person only has 3 previous posts in the forum cant seem to find him doing google fu
352910,you can do that without an airdrop
352911,1m op to bybit assuming bybit is correctsource of tokenswhich received the tokens from optimism team multisig0x2501c477d0a35545a387aa4a3eee4292a9a8b3f0
352912,you dont exactly need to think too hard about all the problems that exist with nontransferable tokens
352913,addresses arent accounts with passwords that you can call the ethereum customer service to change
352914,not arguing that you cant but lets just agree to disagree just think that broadblank punitive measures just because someone sold isnt the best approach
352915,channeling my inner degenspartan excellent proposal encourage people to hodl their responsibilities so that i can dump at higher pricies
352917,well yes but dont you think governance is also free to do whatever it wants with how it allocates future tokens after all the token is a governance token if you sell you precisely sell away your right to have a vote in these discussions
352918,
352919,shill the top again
352920,sweet im a fan already using your product for kusama it would be great if you could at some point build a rewards dashboard like the one for steth that would make tax compliance a lot easier
352921,it is not enough that i should succeed others should failsuzhu
352922,ty ser pleased to hear believe me or not have just talked about it
352923,not the troll we need but the troll we deserve
352925,could i please share whitepaper to get some feedback from community
352926,
352927,lmao this is funny
352928,jfc ban em all d
352929,so most probably those wallets will be excluded from arbitrum and zksync and other l2 airdrops
352930,seems so glad i only sold 5 op to get some eth for gas
352932,its a troll i think so
352933,your souls have been tainted
352934,where is free market spirit so much hate from holders
352935,i sold cause i barely get 1k per month from donations now im banned ok
352936,digital gulag social credit psychotronic jail no more research for optimism
352937,new narrative blackmail people not to sell their token
352938,untransferable nfts are really gonna become a thing arent they
352939,soulbond token right
352940,time to get it double airdrop if you sold free tokens
352941,as long as you can burn that crap i dont mind personally
352942,but you cant though isnt that the point
352943,wasnt there one that costs 32e to burn lel
352944,it will be up to openseaetc to implement spam filters like etherscan had to do for those spam erc20s
352945,only the unblemished shall be let into paradise
352946,so retarded communist social rating approach instead of making better token distribution design they started witch hunting to please greedy noobsare those our heroes
352947,why does free market mean giving people free money though
352948,its obviously very great for the person doing the getting but how is that supposed to help the giver here
352949,well that is part of the game otherwise the giver should have added vesting or restrict the airdrop even more
352950,funny you call this communism when airdrop hunters expect other peoples assets for no specific reason whats that called again
352951,the whole point of this airdrop was to get people talking about optimism their tvl is neglible and decaying tx volumes meh gas prices higher than arbitrumthis wasnt a gesture of goodwill by op labs it was designed to incentivise people to use the damn thing
352952,dont say the quiet part out loud ser
352953,yeah tbh airdrop such airdrops are fucked up token distribution models by default
352954,statistically its almost always better to sell than to hold what did they expect esp w such market conditions greed on both sides
352955,hey 1 lobs 1 lobs just as 1 gear 1 gear
352956,im still interested in arguments for why selling is a good thing tho it puts token into liquidity pools and into cexes is that always good when does it stop being good
352957,sure i wont deny the op token is incredibly useless ahem withoutuse like uni and friends and theyre probably aware of this but giving randos who are tripping over themselves to dump their tokens isnt going to help their tvl
352958,thats why i dumped it but i would surely look into it again in some time
352959,yes selling lobs is crazy
352960,but it puts into peoples wallets soooo
352961,as an airdrop enjoyooooor
352962,but people are retards ser
352963,all airdrops are good except geist
352966,hey are you a dev
352967,lobs is the real deal never selling since airdrop
352968,maybe they should maybe they should isnt that what the proposal is about thoughwed probably have less pding if projects were more selective about who got to hold their tokens potentially fewer disappointments too
352969,lmao
352970,yep we should mark the wallets that sold lobs with an untransferable nft
352971,s p a m s e r s
352972,yeah but the system is too messed up now
352973,idea will send untransferable defamatorycancelculture nft token to people but for a small fee you can protectexclude yourself
352974,jokes on you half the nfts i have are so dumb theyre basically selfblackmailing
352975,but seriously this account registered 3 hours ago has no post history etc can anybody confirm this is legit or a larp
352976,a troll ser i think
352978,wondering how queries based on tx hashes will perform
352979,wait for people to catch up to soulbound 20 docsrmrkappnontransferable
352980,just another extension of cancel culture
352981,might have been a fake post based on comments
352982,damn impressive very detailed explanation of a 0day exploit here where file opening isnt even necessary not sure how legit is the op not that op guys but wow
352984,only applicable to windows not mac fyi
352985,if legitimacy is a problem
352987,can people sue zksync for sending unsolicited tokens to their wallet asking for a frens
352988,lol
352989,lmao dont do it ser
352990,was too lazy to claim first airdropgot more airdrop

353005,any resources understanding cross chain mechanisms with possible future utilities regardless of low tps
353006,seems like most projects use the technical analysis charts package from tradingview what about centralized exchanges what is the premier react packages for chart visualization pricecharts order book ladders depth charts etc

353032,hi everyone someone flagged there were some questions about ondo laas liquidityasaservice and gro yesterday tldr gro effectively borrowed fei from tribe collaterized by gro through the laas offering defaulted despite multiple extensions proposed workarounds out of goodwill from tribe and got liquidated ondo itself is just an intermediary and was not exposed to any of this financially including no feesspreadsrevenuewe havent been particularly public about these deals since theyre dao2dao and dont affect our community but were happy to provide contextour laas offering pairs a token issuer eg gro with a stablecoin issuer eg tribefei the stablecoin issuer provides a base asset so that daos can ramp up their dex liquidity in this case tribe provided 5m fei in november 2021 with 5 apr to create a grofei pair on uniswap tribe additionally gave substantial tribe incentives to gro for joining the launch cohortin the language of our structured products tribe held the senior tranche and gro held the junior tranche with additional assurances offchain unlike our community vaults the token issuer gro agrees to cover any losses to the stablecoin issuer tribeafter these vaults mature janfeb in this case the senior tranche gets paid back first and the remaining amount goes to the junior tranche this means that the junior tranche bears the cost of il note that the goal of the junior tranche in laas is not to be profitable rather its a cheaper alternative to liquidity mining or paying a market maker like jumpwhen these vaults expired gros price had fallen substantially so there was quite a bit of il typically the vaults would sell gro in the markets for fei to cover the difference since gro had low liquidity outside our vaults out of goodwill tribe agreed with gro to settle the transaction via otc to minimize price impact weve facilitated otc settlements with several partner daostribe gave gro multiple extensions to settle otc from feb until now but gro did not settle and more recently became unresponsive gro has a lot of stables in its treasury so it couldve settled directly in the meantime gros price continued to deteriorate the assets finally got liquidated earlier this weekondo is a neutral intermediary providing the protocol facilitating such dao2dao transactions we dont have financial exposure to these vaults we also dont currently generate any revenue from them at the momentour laas vaults have a different risk profile than our community vaults thats why weve restricted to daos for now the primary purpose of these vaults is to increase liquidity an alternative to pool2 liquidity mining market makers like jump bribing protocols etc not to generate a profit obviously loans are risky for both counterparties involved so the daos need to evaluate if its a good fit for most of our partners the program has been a huge success in achieving lowcost liquidity gros vaults were part of the first laas cohort and were iterating on the product to improve the experience for everyone involvedwere happy to clarify any questions feel free to hop on our discordtelegram and our team can answer morecc ivangbi cryptondee coine_r romanscp sonicblend

353035,web3 trello going places
353036,we really back in 2017 huh instead of xxxxx of blockchain this time its xxxxxx of web3
353037,is there a project that calls websockets for exchange data and then reconciles later with oracles and not directly go thru oracle route in order to reduce time lag basically
353039,if its a separate contract probably it should implement ownable interface the ownable contract module can be mixedinto contracts to provide basic access control mechanisms
353040,it is a separate one it is ownable one detail that may be key here is that i never transfered ownership after the deploy itself the deployer wallet is still the current ownercould that be it
353041,maybe os uses transferownership events to set that name and wasnt listening to my contract yet
353042,yes i had the same issue probably triggering change of owner could help to trigger evm event not sure about opensea intrinsics though
353043,instead of mass physical violence against sellers in general could instead have one large horrific outsized violent event eg but more like the crucifixion of jesus rather than a terrorismtype event in order to dissuade sellersreally strong proposals
353044,have the lobsters seen this concerned letter to congress by noncrypto technologists

353051,
353052,coincidentally this was news today yet no powerful new letter
353053,this is just hilarious the biggest human exploiters are crying because there is a slight possibility that new players might enter their arena this is even beyond hottentot morality
353055,when sufficient sacrifice has been paid you will receive a fraction of an eul soon like i said 6 months ago
353057,top crypto podcasts of may
353058,people who recursively borrow pay more interest to lenders so they dont get nothing plus recursive borrowing has never been easier on euler thanks to the mint function its delta neutral farming on any asset whats not to love

353098,is there a schedule for when solana goes down feels like its one a month but just want to make sure
353099,penalty time in our chain safety reports
353100,can you expand on this
353101,
353102,lmao
353103,each time a chain fails we penalize the chains score by 50 for 6 months we figure in terms of technical risk it doesnt get much worse than you not being able to access any funds respond to margin calls whatever else you need solana this is the second time solana has gone down in the past few months and the 8th time so far source the block
353104,is its score in the negatives now
353105,each time the score goes down does the clock reset
353106,what effect does the time drift have on the score
353107,it processes transactions promptly or it gets the hose again
353108,at this point not sure if chain or amusement park
353109,you should build a rating agency for governments too i like how strict this is
353110,yes it perpetuates eg score will now be updated to 50 of 50 ie 14 of existing score
353111,we were trying to consider how this would affect frontrunning etc but havent reached any actionable conclusions
353112,so never 0 or negative shame
353113,reminds of the luna dump never quite 0 but approache it asymptotically
353114,if youre 2m away from me and walk half the distance and then half after and then half once more well never be touching yep close to 0 but not quite
353115,so basically having a 10100 is not 110 of being 100100
353119,fyi its bad habit to come shill randomly sir
353120,is there any data on how many people get wrecked by these
353121,thnks will dig in
353122,river0x
353129,seems like the wrong link got deleted
353130,how many down for this recently
353131,remember this
353132,0 for now because we havent seen any significant risk to funds as a consequence our main concern was pyth other oracles didnt see any alarming signs but were watching
353133,wrecked by downtime unclear i have read a lot of people getting liquidated by moneymarkets during downtime as well as that time wormwhole bridge got exploited but its hard to extrapolate need more resources time to see
353134,why is it down this time tho i remember the previous one was because of nfts or nft sniping bots
353135,i know but it was all over the news last yr sir
353136,if youre gonna do insider trading at least dont use an address that has your name as the ens domain
353137,i know the point was the detention charge etc
353138,american company with american employee us takes insider trading very serious it sets a precedence and gives them a chance to peek under the open sea hood they generated a bazillion dollars in revenue last year prob curious where it went and this is pretext
353139,why do most nft scams get caught due to the same reason i swear 90 of zachxbt threads end with scammer getting caught because they used a wallet with publicly identifiable ens to route their scams
353140,basically solana was stable only 2 months in 2022
353141,nan
353142,i mean still more stable than many of us in crypto
353143,this particular heist career has a low barrier to entry
353144,only one if you check the rpc node uptime
353145,why so often when the month changes just a coincidence
353146,typically coincides with market sentiment changes or nft launches i think anecdotally even on eth gas price is typically high on the first few days of the month because of scheduled nft launches
353147,honestly as a nonparticipant in the ecosystem it seems harder because you need a community influencers generate hype to actually get people to buy but i guess none of those necessitates blockchain knowledge
353148,right tech requirements dominated by socialmarketing machinery that make for the best scams
353149,
353150,have they tried turning it off and on again
353151,nan
353152,is his game plan to release a second millionaire token
353153,ofc
353154,now where have i seen this model before
353155,yeah it was unclear whether or not they had implemented the solar bridge in the end via arweave
353156,billionaire token this time because why not
353157,i honestly love the caption exgoogle techlead bathes in blood
353158,pretty sure he already has a billionaire token came out from the previous millionaire token community which is widely believed to be from the same deployer
353159,
353162,
353163,
353164,just in case you missed it
353165,patrick fitzgerald smartfunds jun 1 2022 at 33720 pmfascinating development here i think this goes to show that the distinction was never a hard line between funds and daos but rather between a fund and a club an org that has seperate gps and lps and an org where everyone is simulataneously gp and lp with no m and p fees interestingly their provision for sweat equity looks a lot like performance fees will that be viewed as another way to earn equity than contributing capital or not either way i have been writing a lot about the developing services stack and it appears daos both those that look like web3 native funds with gps and those that are clubs are moving towards a compliant model of incorperation kyc fund administration and taxationthis pairs well with joel_john s previous writing on solo capitalists 1kx recent report on the unbundling of vcs by service daos
353166,i looked at ens token holders dont get revenue atm
353167,thats not the point protocol amassing revenue you can later decide how to split and use it no revenue nothing to decide on in the first place
353168,does it have a discord server
353169,but so far no protocols are paying out holdersdo we ever expect it to happen
353170,i dont believe so its a project built by metacartel i dont think its built or open now
353171,curve is vecrv pays out some other ones smaller do probably
353172,some are stopped because the unnamed country regulations they are afraid af
353173,some dont yet because they wanna amass a treasury first like ldo
353174,guis pls help its 2 in the night and i cant sleep till i find this tool
353175,
353176,you should consider adding those caveats to your docs
353177,all the wordy storytelling is nice and fine expected even but those docs sell something that this is not without those caveats perhaps the idea is to reveal the caveats after someone has jumped the gun and convinced themselves the offering is a good alternative to the standard runofthemill liquidity mining
353178,the docs reflect our community vaults where those terms dont applylaas has been a private dao2dao offering and we discuss with the daos directly since the program is tailored theres a lot of handholding for laas for nowan upcoming example is goldfinch you can see all the terms above are described in the governance post
353179,in our liquidityasaservice laas offering we started to create vaults for daos who would put their native tokens into one tranche and source the base asset from investors in the other trancheis that the community vault
353180,could you explain this more my understanding is that volatile tokens combines with stables is disastrous from an il perspective this looks a lot like tokemak
353181,by community vault i mean vaults tailored for community investors not dao treasuries ie not dao2dao community vaults are offered directly from our website see there are expired vaults none open at the moment and the community invests directlythe goldfinch vault is not a community vault its also a dao2dao vault between goldfinch and frax the funds will come from their treasuries not the community
353182,any suggestions how to find good chats on crypto here in telegram
353183,thats a quote from your docs whats the page supposed to be describing
353184,exactly the primary purpose of laas variable tranches is to increase liquidity for the token not generate a profit this is meant to be a cheaper alternative to pool2 liquidity mining paying a market maker like jump bribing protocols like tokemak etcthats why we dont offer those to the community directly
353185,you just found it sir look no further
353186,im not sure i understand your questionlaas is a special type of our vaults focused on daos pretty much everything that applies to our vaults applies to laas but laas has extra considerations
353187,the first table is community vaults the second table below is laas vaults
353188,
353189,the goal of community vaults is to make a profit the goal of laas vaults is to increase token liquidity
353190,the link you just shared is about laas not community vaults
353191,right so i fail to see why you brought up community vaults
353192,im not sure what youre asking
353193,could you clarify
353194,here you go
353195,ah the docs primarily focus on community vaults and provide a highlevel overview of laasthe main reason is that laas is fairly tailored to specific partners at this point so certain terms are communicated directly the goldfinch post is an example of a planned vault with such termsnonetheless our docs mention assets will be rebalanced on maturity to pay back the senior tranche see workflows here ondo swaps usdc and eth for each other as needed in order to service redemptionsif the grofei vault had settled like a standard vault thered have been a massive gro liquidation back when the vault expired tribe and gro agreed to settle via otc instead but ultimately did not settle so tribe decided to sell the tokens
353196,my original post earlier today provides a lot more color on why this happen
353197,provide the color in your docs ser carry on
353199,hey everyone we just announced the launch of tr3butor the web3 talent platform weve been working on for the last few months jobs grants and other native web3 quests from the best companies in the industryheres an official announcement the most interesting feature for those who dont want to work but want to make money or hire effectively is referral recruiting refer a friend for a grant or share a job link on telegram and get 10 of the payment if your recommendation is successful winwinwin for the company the talent and anyone who helps them find each otherfor the launch well be doing a genesis nft collection which is essentially the key to the ecosystem with exclusive deals and events governance and airdropsthe first couple hundred people who join the community and pass onboarding will get a guaranteed spot for a free nft mintps all lobsters will get a ticket for the genesis nfts more details soon
353200,if your gonna shill shill your tldr and not a novel
353201,made a thread on it tmeofficer_cia299 actually a cool technique quite rare
353202,wwwyoutubecomwatchvgron5ovd1xq
353203,this guys channel is pretty cool
353204,thanks for posting all of this stuff btw
353206,anyone going to consensus what side events are u looking forward tosame question for nftnyc ethcc
353207,velodrome live
353208,
353209,velo airdrop claimable yesterday we got op today we are getting velo from velodrome this airdrop goes to people who received op yesterday curve convex magic redacted weve and platypus usersclaim it now airdrop thread
353210,anyone got the contratc address for velo
353211,
353212,liquidity is coming in
353213,and its gone
353214,cant believe lobs didnt get any
353215,anyone have an example of a dutch auction contract where the funds are sent back for people that overpaid
353216,basically a contract where everyone pays the lowest price
353217,i know some exist but dont remember their names
353218,gnosis auction
353219,we use it for our bond auctions
353220,also miso batch auction stuff too right
353223,there was a popular thread from a solidly fork protocol explaining what was wrong with solidly from their perspective and what they were doing to improve it i thought it was velodrome but apparently not anyone has any idea what i could be talking about
353224,i think it was called bilidly
353225,or smth like that
353226,ah yeah that name sounds more familiar hope google can figure out what i want
353227,does it do nfts
353228,i meant dutch auction nft sale
353229,someone sent me this example
353230,why not eligible ser
353231,i think most people are not aware that evmos has activated inflation on their protocol if you dont want to get diluted you should claimstake regularly
353234,is velodrome a pure solidly fork or are there changes
353235,
353236,has anyone mentioned adjoint yet
353237,no idea what that is
353238,adjoint is diehls company where he develops blockchainbutnotreally fintech solutions for businesses
353241,recommended by lex
353242,whats next cory doctorow also a scammer or he got scammed by diehl adjoint has long failed no
353243,he seems like a bad case of sour grapes another stolfi
353246,doctorow hates crypto because hes a communist so maybe a case of stange bedfellows bruce schneier hes a cryptographer for sure he doesnt suffer from lack of understanding
353248,i think this goes a little deeper quite a few people from the berkman klein center seem to hate crypto
353252,to a degree they are precisely the kind of people you want to point to when justifying regulations do you really think lawerence lessig is irrelevant he seems influential but i dont know his views on crypto
353253,hes on faculty at berkmans
353257,i like bruce scheiners point about trust to a certain point calling everything a fraud maybe a bit too over the top
353260,hes this sort of notorious law professor in certain circles and one time presidential candidate coined the phrase code is law and the creative commons license so you know him just not by name does the name joi ito mean anything to you
353264,redacted a couple msgs weird slander fin
353266,mrkwhg sowwy sowwy just didnt seem relevant as in some larper is writing some bs covered opinions given all good moving on
353268,is this how daos registered in virginia or just an llc not a dao llcwho knows
353272,thats a trademark application
353273,surethe question was about how dao llc are functioningrepresenting in the documents as llc or dao llc this was a questionbut i think in that case bankless isnt dao llc
353274,yeah pretty sure thats just their operating company
353275,not the dao
353276,hi guys does anyone know if there is a defi platform that would automate or offer vaults using option credit spreads i could do them manually with lyra or deribit but just started to wonder if there is a structured defi product that would do them for me
353277,i hope they dont enforce the trademark in chat writing bankless will get tedious
353278,where was the info thread on the loop of abradabra degenbox 1 borrow fee at opening idk i have vague memory that basically opening a position there with ust entailed 15 buys up spell right away and thats was the sexy part there for treasury i could be totally wrong just trynna remember
353280,was that covered in the letter or are you referring to some of his essays
353281,
353282,thats kinda against tetranodes plan
353283,curve still got to worry about dpxusd too lmao
353284,lowering a while pool is off balans means impermanent loss becomes permanent
353285,lps get rekt so thats not so good
353286,currently theres too little pusd relative to 3crv
353287,so if pusd supply goes up a can be safely lowered
353288,which is why were recommending that more collateral be added to jpegd so more pusd can be minted and depositedswapped in that pool
353289,nan
353290,and then a can be lowered without too much loss
353291,hey guys we are developing the yield routing protocol need some feedback and advisory could someone point us where we can find itthe main concept is about routing among such aggregators like beefyautofarm
353292,aggregating aggregators
353293,yeap lol would you mind to look at wp just for the discussion
353296,i heard you like aggregators so i put
353297,lol the main idea to provide users simple tool finding the best yield farmingrecompoundat the moment
353298,interested to hear more doing something in a tangential vein that could benefit from tech like this you working with erc4626
353299,thats aggregating and aggregator again
353300,yes its may sounds not so good for pros but for new users it might be useful
353301,the idea is to aggregate all aggregatorsfarmingsstakings and provide best to users
353302,send me a dm if you put together a standardized api we might be interested in utilizing yall
353303,and one more cool thing was to create a deflationary tokenomics my main idea was to create something that will be like sum we burnsum we unfreeze but the concept was far from ideal unfreezing schedule pointed to infinity but as a concept i believe it was good cause all the linear and stuff is a bs
353304,where will the burning come from revenues or how
353305,yes
353306,revenues
353307,thats nothing new or interesting per se in fact burning tokens is more like a retail narrative more so a useful thing u get rid of expansion possbilities
353308,anyway fin on the discussion sowwy giving floor for no reason rn
353309,he asked for an advicehe received iteverything is coollove this chat
353310,sorry ivan adding a bit and overmany shitcoins tried to implement hyperdeflation and in fact it didnt work well cause sell pressure was hyperincreasing as well
353311,it really depends on your math tbh
353312,the math doesnt work in your favor senpai
353313,it depends on many factors but keeping aside speculation premium market conditions etc it depends on what your product is and how good it isthe question is how much money is really there between aggregating aggregators since they are taking a fee on top of farming but adding their coin you might aggregate them and slap your own fee on top while having inflation to attract depositors but it doesnt make much sense to me then not sure anyway
353314,nan
353315,anyway this is not a shill fest place i hope some brief feedback helped but going further is not cool buy the nft and ask kingdom if u want dd
353316,lmao ikr this
353317,the only acceptable shill fests are mega pints
353318,stop shiling
353319,its mega pint szn so no
353320,wtf is mega pints
353321,amber heard accused johnny depp of drinking mega pints
353322,it became a meme since
353323,even more now since he won
353324,hence mega pint season
353325,platty joobs mega pints
353326,its sorta like one of these i think
353327,
353328,but they tried to insinuate he poured himself this size of wine
353329,hence the meme
353331,fin sers this please continue in kingdom
353332,
353333,i wonder how this will go actually if there is still any appetite for gamefi metaverse whatever whatever narratives
353334,incentives turn on in 24h
353335,i had too many mega pints last night tbh
353336,yearnlove from banteg
353337,lobster daily 429 daily recap 1 jun 1 yearn finance principles check out here yearnlove2 does anyone know of a toolwebsite that lets you see token amounts in a wallet at a certain time back in historylink to discussion 3 were do you guys find good projects ever second theres a scam token launched can i get some help finding legit projectslink to discussion 4 gro token could not evolve to provide value to holders link link to discussion 5 a severe attack in ms word docs allowing hackers to take full control of your computer without even opening the file link link to discussion 6 sextoearn project review from the defiant bear market we deservedlink link to discussion 7 us charges opensea exemployee in first nft insider trading case link link to discussion 8 solana network halted link link to discussion link to discussion
353338,
353339,yes im bain
353340,im auction watching all the cheap lands are gone but expensive ones have no bids it seems
353341,retail is in but whales are out
353342,kingdom discussion dd
353343,wasnt there no vesting on these really suprising for a deal that large
353344,
353345,346 minted out of 100000
353346,what are they doing with the eth raised for land again
353348,goes to warwick pockets
353350,74 goes to warwick pockets
353351,26 is the share of all stakers
353352,why etherscan create 2 page for a token contract
353354,houses in aussie land arent cheap
353355,wdym
353356,
353357,they aim fo dn
353358,100 of the raiseand back in eth or converted to ilv back to staker
353360,jesus
353361,it creates 2 pagesone for the contract itself generic for all contracts with interaction log transactions and readwrite interfacethe other for erc20 interface supplied by that contract to show holders some statistics token transfers
353362,to add dex tradesholders in case the address is a token i guess
353363,why both have transaction tab and both have different txns there shouldnt both have same set of transactions as every interaction with token is interaction with contract address
353365,one shows all the interactions with the contract call to any function the other only the transfers
353366,how is dola journey going and the redemption didnt see nours tweets for a while
353367,whats the new backing for susd and whats the latest on it i heard it has lusd now and is more safu milli3e
353368,blz shill
353369,susd is partially backed by eth and lusd in its current form
353370,and the lusdeth backed portion can be redeemed anytime via the wrapper contract 1inch routes through it as well
353371,could u link me blz my memory still tells me 700 coll ratio from snx haha i am so late
353372,cratio is currently set to 300
353373,so if you stake snx you can mint susd with a 33 ltv
353374,
353375,at the bottom of that dashboard youll find how much eth and lusd are also backing susd
353376,currently at 38k eth and 45m lusd backed
353377,so roughly 113m of susd is backed by collateral other than snx and those collaterals are availble in a wrapper contract which any one can redeem from on a 11 basis minus a fee
353378,for eth you mintburn seth at 11 which can be swapped back for susd with no slippage
353379,for lusd you mintburn susd at 11 minus a fee
353380,so in case you were wondering susd is very well backed and very redeemable
353381,can anyone tell me how to sign a terra address proving ownership
353382,how to the daily txn volume on other blockchains than ethereum
353383,see use a block explorer
353388,they were paid with imx token the fuck were they supposed to do with it hold to 0
353389,was covered here back in feb they dumped 30m tokens upon receiving the first part of the 100m grant
353390,
353391,weve entered the then they fight you fase of the adoption curve
353392,when do we win cuz right now im losing
353393,dunno but this can take a long time
353394,i almost just swapped to gusd fk that
353395,they sued over something which happend in 2017 jeez how obvious do you want it
353396,but yeah as you said actions from 2017
353397,nan
353398,yeah can confirm that gro was given the option to do an otc deal and received an extension of over three months
353399,then gro stopped responding afaik for a couple months so not sure what else the fei team was supposed to do
353400,wen new video
353401,
353402,
353403,anyone know who 0xa92be7f728ef585851212b1ceb318b8a2fbacc96 is
353404,they have 45 lobsterdao nft
353407,ethswarmeth
353414,i think they bought anyway this stuff is for kingdom chat pinned link
353416,you familiar with feeder finance just went bankrupt the model wasnt sustainable although the website was super sleek and service was smooth af
353421,one year to migrate if youre on the graph hosted service
353422,sucks balls this will not make the ones using hostedservices to use their mainnet
353423,i guess we will need to spin off our own indexers
353424,yep
353425,and they will just make it more difficult to develop in the graph
353426,once again the turn fees on move does not work smoothly
353427,it never does because they dont have a way of doing so without having to go through their api x
353428,so just raising the bar of difficulty in order to get there to be honest
353429,but once you spin off your indexer there is no reason to move to decentralized indexer other than availability decentralization which are important
353430,fwiw they have been offering grants to projects to switch but yeah its hard to sell the decentralized solution with the token query business model when one can self host and there are alternatives available
353431,yeap also im not sold on the tokenomic of when you update the subgraph curators get their staked tokens cut
353432,isnt there like a 10 penalty on update
353433,i might be off tho
353434,is there a video of the presentation
353436,this is the biggest blocker tbh some subgraphs would take thousands to upgrade
353437,thank the bear market for making it cheaper right now
353438,yeap also developing a subgraph correctly is not as easy as it looks for complex dapps so it might take a lot of bug fixing until you have something stable tbh in fact i have been cutting features from my subgraph to make it more stable kek
353439,mood
353440,have you tried writing tests
353441,its a time
353442,the only way to do it right on my opinion is when you think about indexing when you are writing the contracts
353443,matchstick framework is pretty new afaik i started last week to write the unit tests
353444,very true also not a lot of helping devs getting setup but lots of pushing devs to migrate to their paid version after setup
353445,i went pretty deep with matchstick on the yearn vaults subgraph it takes a lot of effort to get anything remotely close to 100 coverage
353446,yeap to be completely honest i feel that if we had a debugger for the graphs that would be a 1000x improvement
353447,yeah that would be big
353448,tons of times ive found bugs and having to literally debug by logging the logs also get ordered pretty weird its insane in 2022 haha
353449,we are so early meme
353450,
353451,and some kinds of errors will prevent the logs from flushing
353452,for avalanche mev enjoyers
353453,fucking finally knows my pain
353454,hahahaha
353455,heres the nightmare that is our tests
353456,im not alone lol
353457,wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy
353458,its trying to emulate chainlink but forgets its largely a nicetohave rather than a needtohave like chainlink
353459,they need to drastically change how subgraphs are written because in its current state it doesnt feel like these methods will scale
353460,100 but honestly i feel debugger would be the 1000x improvement tho
353461,i dont think they can even do that because its assemblyscript it might be on the as people to make it happen
353462,nah dude that is insane way too big its like watching someone hurtthemselves
353463,my subgraph is like 18th of that and it already feels diff
353464,kudos to you and the contributors on that one believe it or not i did touch that codebase in the early days with some other anon name
353465,someone has to figure out all the wrong ways to do it lol
353466,
353467,quickly launch a synthetic eth product that allows maker to tap into the mergedoes this mean maker is creating a lido competitor to steth
353469,the farming rewards means this will immediate drive governance participation and help deal with voter apathy and centralization of governancelol
353470,he is a big angel in lido isnt he would be weird
353471,the post largely reads like rainbows and unicorns we will fix everything and aspire into greatness by changng the sctructure of the dao
353472,rwa to deploy dai into us treasuries
353473,good illustrations
353474,from here u can read the actual sauce
353475,just so u save urself half an hour
353476,i guess here is the answer no not that
353477,he wants his synthetic eth to be the standard instead of steth
353478,did you read the part about arnolddao yet
353479,and then rocketpool stakewise lido etc can all battle anyway
353480,but they are the ones paying for liquidity bribes and all so why synthetic eth itself
353481,no where
353482,looks like it was rebranded to just governordao was cooler before
353483,shib founder deleted all tweets and blog posts ryoshi i am not important and one day i will be gone without notice take the shiba and journey upwards frensshould all decentralized project founders eventually disappear
353484,the beginning of the end
353485,charlie lee did better tho
353486,worked well in satoshis case
353487,lets compare shib and bitcoin sure
353488,well the interesting question is whether all decentralized project leaders should eventually disappear
353489,if shib fails coz ryoshi disappeared that means it wasnt a decentralized project that succeeded from talents of contributors from all over
353490,what talents
353491,are you really comparing dog shit copy pasta with bitcoin
353492,its just a bad comparison case sers nvm ofc shiba is a rug scam and there was never any project but the broad question of amazongirl by itself is fine
353493,there is 0 infra its literally just a shitcoin
353494,ahhh let it be
353495,yes bad comparison
353496,question stands
353497,yes the bus factor basically theres just nothing for ppl to contribute to in this case
353498,yo how does mkr burn 436m a year not including comp
353499,they should be able to but uh its not exactly secret how the comlunitee members take that in practice
353501,what a scammer lol
353502,most of decentralized projects will dissappear if core team is disappeared thus governance tokens
353503,the original soul bound token till death do you part every bagholder is rich else scam
353504,no there is shibswap shibnft and shit like this
353505,i am not sure i totally get this synth eth wrapping steth
353506,an update around cf
353507,a synth eth that might make more sense could be something like deposit daistables mint synth eth that replicates the staking rewards of steth
353508,imma pretend i didnt learn this
353509,maybe i read too quickly and dont have full context
353510,thanks coiner new word added to my lexicon
353512,bitcoiners think ethereum is a shitcoin whats your point everything is relative and a matter of degree
353514,lol
353515,google illusory truth effect
353516,no one is praising hayes ethics or character but hes an exceptionally shrewd observer of and has a very deep understanding of global macro and traditional finance and crypto as well as being a very good writer and the combination of those four things makes him almost unique
353517,anyone in this graph day event seems they announced a new web3 browser
353518,he also has huge network connections in financial world
353519,simply disregarding his opinion is bad already sbf doea the same as he did before but ct praising sam cz did a lot for the space but people hates him
353521,lol what a stupid take
353522,here i thought some earth shattering news would be revealed
353523,arthur hayes is a fabulous writer with lucid insights he is sly and cunning yes but so are most adept entrepreneurs he just doesnt hide it nor pretend to be politically correct
353528,hello may l ask who was the artist behind solidly ui
353529,if only brevity was a crime
353530,sometimes every morsel is a treasure and more is more not less but same length divided into separate sittings enhances digestion
353531,sometime when you cant amaze with brilliance you drown them in bullshit
353532,its not a competition about brilliance i take the useful parts and discard the rest
353535,how is azure vs google cloud vs aws looking now i am building a metaverse gamelike proj there is a lot to do on the cloud most of it will be computational models but some multiplayer game server hosting small game rendering and streaming with unreal or webxrwebassembly too to xr devices
353536,hey everyone does someone know of any resources that talk about how rollups plan to incentivize running sequencers since thats the next step in decentralizing l2s
353537,i think polynya has a thread on it
353538,
353539,investor protection
353540,in solidly is ve voting power or does voting power decay over time any quick pointers to where voting power is set used in code thanks
353541,note that crypto backedalgo stables are not in the regal definition of stable coin
353542,
353543,they should tar and feather anyone that sells their op tokens
353544,
353545,time to make a government proposal
353546,op team should make the crucifixion of christ seem like a wedding to op dumpers
353548,ve votingescrow balance is calculated in vesol
353549,bilidly has published quite a lot of doc about how solidly work and solidly tokenomics work you should check their documentation
353550,everyone sybils airdrop and gives op volume gets airdrop op says op token dumpers bad literally the reason they had volume as a mechanism airdroppers are much better distribution mechanism than solidly lets give to protocols theyll behave correctly
353551,i checked the chart it looks like the tokenomics was set to downward facing dog position
353552,clearly solidly tokenomics were surprisingly very bad given the big brains behind what is even surprising is that some forks like dystopia decided to keep the same tokenomics
353553,at least velo improved the reward schedule bad thing is they are not really fixing the issue of liquidity for lockers we would need to have some secondary liquidity for lockers otherwise its not very attractive to lock for years i am afraid that without this it doesnt really work yet
353554,isnt that an argument to not be giving tokens to what youve basically described as transient tx spammers
353559,i mean you need the biggest challenge in crypto is fair distribution how do you do it without giving preferences if not to presales then from network participation which is fairer all same price instead of discounted rounds at least ppl that got the most put most capital on the actual network
353561,maybe souldrops is a thing that will change the game
353562,anyone
353563,ivangbi when you realize that tetranode with jpged literally did what we talked about a few weeks ago deither buy the stablecoin at a premium force use their protocol or all their emissions get collected by themselves from crvcvx
353564,in this case anyone can mint their stable using nfts like punks though right
353565,not like theyre maintaining exclusive control over minting
353566,the evmos team gets 25 of inflation
353567,not sure how they do it in the code though as their inflation module doesnt make reference to the their 25 allocation although there is 25 unaccounted for in their distributiion parameters
353568,ah they front loaded it so they have 200 m vesting over 4 years
353569,still a crazy number though
353570,ye aka forced to use the protocol with possible liquidation risk
353571,
353572,
353573,is this april 1
353574,honestly doesnt matter unless you want to use their platform specific features which i dont think you do because in that case you would have already selected the platform to build on top of instead of asking here just plop it on a docker and make sure your state is not in there so you can easily switch out if and when the need arises
353575,he is working towards something
353576,he should work for the sec or irs fits perfectly
353577,
353578,not sure you can make subgraphs from an ipad or something
353579,do i have to buy an ipad now smh
353580,yeah i also saw the ipad and macbook questions and rolled my eyes a bit d
353581,what was this
353582,the geo waiting list questionaire
353583,hi does anyone have any recommendations where i might be able to find historic chainlink price data available in csvjson
353584,can anyone here help me with reading code from gethmevgeth specificly the block construction part im good at cpp but a noob at go and code isnt well documented pls dm
353585,you can take all historical data directly from sc by calling getrounddataround_id
353586,you can fetch it directly from onchain logs datai made a code and a report for some of the pricefeeds on ethereum
353589,thank you
353590,hi degens i am trying to contact the future fund this is for my project on governance and id like to discuss a couple of things with them anyone has a contact at the team there if yes please dm i would be very grateful
353591,
353592,anyone know of a good crypto marketing group legit stuff not evil marketing
353593,i know these 2 teams and seen their work but anyways dyortwittercomhypepartnerstwittercommyceliumgrowth
353594,is mycelium the aussie team behind tracer
353595,dont know for sure been working with them when i was in immunefi so know only about stuff related to their work in this specific project
353596,more looking for a lobsterdao chat of marketers less interested in hiring an agency
353598,tx
353599,ohm not exploited a seed investor dumped it
353600,sr
353601,also interested in such a thing would be great to chat marketing
353602,5 is
353607,
353608,if you are looking for content production i can suggest
353609,not marketing
353610,huh its almost like the big institutions knew it was going to implode all along and just didnt mind dumping on retail who could have anticipated that
353611,it could be anyone luna is a ponzi it could die any time
353612,looking for some mev experts potentially compensated dm me if interested
353614,update your docs to include access control info implement a bug bounty of 200k explain who invested
353615,tbh you havent updated your docs in 3 months and you launch in 25 days this is unacceptable imo
353616,that only makes sense if the people intend on actually bothering with the network for longer than 5 minutes after they get tokensyou should prefer those people over transient tx spammers its not like the spammers actually care about fair distribution
353617,tbh i find it quite chad of jump to publish such an analysis i bet they were among the big ones who got out i guess what it shows is that despite all public shilling the big boyz knew that theyd be able to get out if shit were to hit the fan and they did
353618,contribution to protocol revenue
353619,looking at your repo theres more details but you should digest these functional spec into simple language for users not devs in your gitbook my main concern is the number of validators but it seems like youve done some good work so far at getting that up a roninstyle fuckup shouldnt be as easy here multichain is extremely complicated as im sure youre well aware and you should probably hire a specialist team to consult you on this one will be pretty expensive theres so many different attack vectors here you need to implement an entire security strategy and use forta tenderly with sms alerts this is serious stuff youre trying to do
353620,discord invite link is invalid
353621,which docs are you refering to
353622,we have 20 validators now and will have more
353624,i see there were some updates but seems to be not merged
353627,not okay to discuss further given the previous disrectionary banning of wallets that were simply trading unless there is post mortem with regard to those its a major red flag going forward that would apply to any protocol as we wanna stay impartial even including the ones we favoured talked about before
353628,all are recovered and ownership is fully burnt to 0x0
353629,ok chief btw kingdom chat for u is oke to share just jump in there first pinned link
353630,okay
353631,hey anyone looking for a solidity dev
353632,blz check daily ape hr or lobsters hr
353633,thanks
353634,your community is your best marketing group
353635,is this still a thing
353636,as long as the token goes up
353637,kek
353638,yeh but where do all the marketing ppl from all the projects hang out
353639,should be better to have people knowing and using the project speaking about it marketing stuff are just here to make and dont even know what the product is about you are paying for a database not for a real spirit
353640,in their moms basements
353641,i costarted one of these called community of communities a while ago it died off a bit as we all had actual communityfocused responsibilities that superceded our metaresponsibilities
353642,but it still exists on telegram
353643,maybe you should google dao
353644,dm me i can add you in
353645,ur like 2 cycles behind the meta
353646,at the crypto conferencesbtw this topic is boring and pushing people to share links of marketingpr agencies consultants and etclets fin here
353647,where to devs hang out idk ffs maybe on stack overflow in dms in their own respective private groups u r not gonna be in either of those thoughbut how to be in those start creating smth unique keep shipping little by little grow ur network as a result cold outreach its a slow process gl 3pleb discussion fin
353648,wise man gif here
353655,hi lobsterdao
353656,have a question im hoping this group can answer are there any alternatives to set protocol
353657,set protocol as in the framework to make indexed positions or what exactly
353658,would make consider enso to be relatable and enzyme but if you take a position of index is actually a vault and a vault can be any strategy even yearn then
353659,yes they make index tokens is there any other protocol thats doing that
353660,well they dont actually right see above tho its indexcoop galleon that do it with the use of set protocol no
353661,im looking to launch a custom index token
353662,would look into enso and enzyme too i guess then
353663,the priority fees i set exactly that i pay
353664,awesome thank you
353665,dhedge settoken also but very limited assets
353666,anyone here coming to consensus i will shill some events to the lobster community
353667,yes im speaking at consensus
353668,shilled
353669,also lobster dao who is a reputable options trading platforms for btc and eth looking for your reccomendation
353670,binance is pretty good
353671,ser bzl why anyway hegic is still alive worked opyn for some i forget the ones that do only dov and that actually do options
353672,where one may see composition of mim collateral
353674,deribit is miles ahead of anything else ftx for us users none of the defi options are even close combination of lack of liquidity not having expiries beyond a few days or weeks etc
353675,it will be 1 lobs ser
353676,wut
353678,it seems like this chart is outdated ser
353679,yeah indeed probably outdated its 5x ust marketcap in there
353680,is it still around 150m
353681,coingecko says
353682,lol interesting number
353683,ok this is the source recommended by their teams
353684,just realized mim had shrunk to 400m mc wow guess it shows the system is working as intended
353685,i see ib still available there a bunch allowed for yearn ftm and a bunch for avax
353686,not sure how well those handle liquidations even
353687,
353688,quick someone make that troy horse meme
353689,the only time where i liked do kwon was the vid where he said maybe i just dont dream about the us every night and dont obsess with you guys
353691,tru
353692,did they ask the two asian kids building houses in sand somewhere in south east asia who never been to the us to file w8ben forms
353693,i would imagine youtube aint giving em money unless they submit their dna results and do some form filings
353695,
353696,
353697,has anyone compiled a list of crypto development agencies would love to figure out which ones have a good reputation in the ecosystem
353698,crypto development de fuk is that
353699,if i put priority fees in metamask ui 50 then will it use exact number 50 as priority fees
353700,per gas yes
353701,ok so its not max priority right its only priority if i type 1000 there it will deduct that much gwei per gas
353702,usg tries to claim jurisdiction over the entire world what else is new
353703,correct theres no basefee type thing going on with the priority fee its the miner tip
353704,on gnosis often txns are submitted with a very low basefee like 00001 gwei and a prio fee of 1
353705,team of devs that implement crypto projects
353706,there are devshops each to their own irl dev teams doing outsource stuff dont really need any vetting because they are irl normal businesses so they werent born to scam per se unless on hourly billing kek altho if its some sc work and real stuff not front end stuff i would argue no one would stay in such a firm if they can get good deals from any decent startup with a much higher pay unless some exclusive ones idk such tho
353707,and they fail most of the time right
353709,no
353710,first txns cant fail due to too low gas price they just wont be included
353711,second the basefee is very low on that chain because blocks arent full most of the time
353712,if you have any resources related it please do share here i am also looking for some vetted ones
353713,thanks makes sense just wondering where would web2 large brands go to or would they hire inhouse solidity devs to launch projects
353714,check developerdao xbankert youll prob get some leads asking there
353715,hey yall we are building kresko novel synthetic asset protocol uses singlecdpperaccount modelwe opened a waitlist for our alpha access if youre a sophisticated defi user wed like to have you
353716,also if anybody is interested composing synthetic assets on their wallets and dapps happy to chat
353717,gib tokens to lobsterdao holders sers
353718,saft signed already
353719,nope hence contemplating to delet or not
353720,then at least gib to lobsters
353721,haha youll come sign up and help us improve the protocol
353722,does anyone know good free or cheap wallet txs visualizers
353723,breadcrumbs
353724,exactly what needed thanks
353725,has anyone heard about this integrallink so basically this is a onchain otc for large orders devs recently launched a product called size and it has a slogan size matters last year they raised 30mln heavily underradar worthilyyesterday i came across this twitter account not only this project has the same idea on chain otc for large orders it has the same name and the same slogan as the integrals productam i getting it right that some guy just stole the idea the name and the slogan of the existing product and raised 6 mln
353726,nan
353727,nopeintegral size is an amm built for very large whale swapsthis new sizemarkets is for otc trades of vested unvested tokens
353729,
353730,ok the idea part is different what about name and slogan still looks fishy
353731,cant comment on that as not part of either teamwe just labelindex large 2m dex swaps for integral and saw a huge market need for new size otc for vested tokens plus 3ac invested which still has cache
353732,cache
353733,cachet
353734,are there any decompiler that gives you readable solidityesque code for unverified contracts
353735,you can install panoramix yourself the newer version is better last i tried than the version on etherscan
353736,oh i thought etherscan already used the latest version cool will try it out
353737,it might now in the past it wasnt on the latest im not sure if they have updated though
353738,new here
353739,
353740,bit of hope for us degenerates in the eu
353741,in our case prev web2 studio we gained ptsd from an ico in 2017 and became a web3 studio since then i personally migrated to sc developer now auditor and blockchain researcher so we ended up both training existing ppl as well as hire for the new mindset
353742,i know of a few other studios in pt that either went to web3 as well or ended up being acquired to become the devs for some large crypto corp cough uphold cough
353743,wait if you have ptsd from 2017 ico why would you become an web3 studio
353744,because its that bad of a ptsd that were sadistic nownow but srlsly was joking they were indeed the craziest times at our company but very successful in the end raised 22m and the project got acquired a few months ago
353745,traumatised by huge bags of cash
353746,nan
353747,how come irob bank has such high voting crv issuance they dont have any assets do they who s voting ser michwill
353748,nan
353749,youd be surprised some ppl dont make the best budget decisions when their project goes from 0 to millions in a few days
353750,no idea not me
353751,is there an easy way to see the voter for a certain pool sorry for newbie questions
353752,you can check a gauge weight voting page but it has a limited ability to look into past
353755,germany has strong lobby group they will block all the unnecessary bills by eu
353756,the same people that bodied greens and their boiling oceans nonsense
353757,no some blockchain group have strong connection to current finance minister includin patrick who tweeted this also one whatsapp group where they openly discuss this
353758,yes the crypto lobby in germany is pretty strongwhatsapp group is indeed goodmostly in german language
353759,anyone know about a list of accelerator programs in crypto
353760,
353761,is this as bad as it reads
353762,re consequential state transitions i reckon there are probably going to be detectable differences between executing in a simulated vs actual environment so not foolproof either
353763,can a smart contract detect a simulation i assumed the whole point of simulation against the mainnet was that to the smart contract it was indistinguishable
353764,how would it detect it no it should behave just the same as it would in reality in actual onchain interactions thats the experience with tenderly for example and the sim mode we have within defi saver for usersthere could be issues with how things are being simulated though something may always be not handled properly there
353765,simulation is done locally on mainnet fork so i assume no
353766,it cant and if it could whatever it was doing would have to be right there in the contract code so the simulator could just override that code and proceed as usual
353767,blockcoinbase whitelist for the few largest miners for instance
353770,you can easily override state and add yourself to the whitelist
353771,also that would just mean users would be up to the mercy of their tx not falling on the smaller miners by bad luck
353772,well he is important made his money etc
353773,i know who is behind tbh
353774,whitecollars making more on retail classic
353775,say who then or dont say this
353776,thomas greco
353777,yes any contract you interact with can steal all your rune i think ive shown an example around a year ago
353778,nan
353779,this never heard of tbh
353780,blz proofs or just conspiracy
353781,i cannot sadly or i am going to be kicked out of an insiders group lol and where do i get my private seed rounds then haha
353782,you could but that requires that would require someone to figure out what to change and also do that in a reasonable amount of time which would leave a pretty large window of opportunity for phishing scams
353783,
353784,probably would be good enough to cover 9095 of hashrate then the scammer would just get a couple less rune
353785,
353786,lmao
353787,either were mixing conversations or i fully missed that the question i was answering was about rune
353788,attacker could simply not rug the user if it detects or guesses that the tx was being simulated eg by checking blockcoinbase against a whitelist of the top few miners since ganache etc usually set blockcoinbase to 0x0 or something iircthen displaying state transitionsemitted eventswhatever would end up being useless in this case
353789,so youd still leave holes if you attempted to patch over the bad design in the ethrune token contract with displaying to users what they are signing etc
353790,not that showing users what would happen if they sent a tx is bad but it gives a false sense of security
353791,im aware we were just talking about different things i guess
353797,
353798,dear couch lawyers is mobile game still just a mobile game if the coins you play with can be withdrawn as crypto
353799,not a couch lawyer but i think app stores wont allowsource im a couch app store expert since i read a couple articles
353800,apple will definitely be all over you for that and obviously google just started getting aggressive over enforcing its inapp payments policy
353802,shame they got gabagool that weve disaster of his with the arbitrarily high fees does not make for a good role model
353803,its not just a legal issue app stores want their cut of the money and to control payments its why amazon still wont let you buy kindle books on phone in their app
353804,is there some free api for testnetsuch as kovan contract event logs
353805,hitting the kovan rpcs
353806,dune doesnt run on testnets because of no business model even tho mainnet hasnt one either really
353807,yeah the graph doesnt support testnet either but sometimes projects want to collect some testnet datas before they launch on mainnet
353808,eh
353809,no its because they prioritise whats in higher demand there clearly is more demand for mainnets data only a very small subset of users are interested in testnets data would be stupid to prioritise stuff with smaller tam
353810,yeah one does not think about the costs they have on running the whole thing up you can always run your own etl and host your database but running an airflow instance is not computational cheap and a postgres sql in aws is quite expensive
353811,i believe the best option is making a script querying the rpc transforming events into a csv that is not hard at all
353814,but actually having a testnet instance with charts even tho slowly queued and migrateable to mainnet when formally deployed can ease a lot of data design problems imo itd be nice to have disposable etls to ensure that users dont abuse the service only decode your contract for 1mth or so
353815,
353816,
353819,1inch something about otc starts it seems
353820,any good general nft collectors channels
353821,
353822,is there a way in the etherscan api to identify if an address is a contract or an eoa checking internal tx doesnt work asking an eoa for verified contract source code returns 0 but not all contracts are verified so there can be false negatives
353823,
353824,again werent they hacked already
353825,yes
353826,well really concerning if the most well funded team cant prevent its community from social engineering attacks which i am guessing it is because dont think discord as a platform has disclosed any vulnerability
353830,in discord when you enable 2fa every admin is forced to activate 2fa to reaccess the channel
353831,so either idiot admin or 2fa wasnt activated
353832,possible also the main email has no 2fa
353833,is there a tool that opens a site that you made in different resolutions devices browsers all at once for testing
353834,yeah i dont remember what theyre called though
353835,usability testing tools
353836,nan
353837,how did you do the spoiler text
353838,
353839,cool seems like for simulations and testing i just wanna see if the site renders legitamatly accross devices resolutions oss and browsers
353840,does anyone know where to generate similar transaction graphs saw this earlier but no source as to where it was generated
353841,ms paint text and arrows
353842,powerpoint is the easiest way
353843,or drawio
353844,maltego
353845,that looks like someone took a screenshot and added the red overtop with ms paintonly website i know off hand is breadcrumbsapp
353846,appreciate the responses gents lol yea the red text is the easy part

353851,i hope these resources will help ya i may have missed a couple tho
353852,thank you for the links ill start reading
353854,youve already got a reply sir this chat is techfocused tmelobsters_chat353632dailyapehr lobsters_hr
353855,sorry if it is not the right place to ask for but i have never asked anything regarding this project before thank you though if you help me find a team
353856,what are some of the best desmos links to test slippage functions or just defi math
353859,any lobsters going to be in austin next week for consensusi have some free codes for a cool side event that backd is sponsoring on the 9th send me a dm if interested
353860,what time is it at well be there in full force but thursday is kinda a down day so maybe interested
353861,
353863,i remember i was so impressed by that when they announced it years back what an amazingly powerful piece of software to perform any intelligence gathering and general exploration of networks orgs or anything really
353864,
353865,there is this paid option that i came across once never used it myself but the guy who recommended it knows his frontend stuff
353867,anyone have thoughts on polkadot switch away from a counsel and towards a liquid democracy model where you delegate tokens to a representative of your choice im excited to see how it turns out but at the same time concerned itll turn into a political spectacle with elections type feeling
353868,this is really transitioning to a multicouncil model rather than a strictly tricameral governance system as is the case now so it is a direct improvement since different councils will hopefully have different expertise rather than be a popularity contest
353869,oh hm i listened to a podcast yesterday of course now i cant find it and it sounded more like counsels were to be discarded entirely very possible i misunderstood
353870,so its not a liquid democracy model where you delegate to members of the counsel or just any rando you choose
353871,
353872,i think thats the episode
353873,so until now it was on council and on technical committee alongside tokenholdersto pass a referendum like a forkless upgrade or a simple variable change or just an xcm message you would previously have two options1 to ask the council to make a motion and then if all or most councilors agree it will be either negative turnout bias super majority fail or simple majority by the dotksm holders to vote the referendum in2 propose publicly as a pleb and then it is positive turnout bias super majority approvethe technical committee could expedite any pending referendum to make it execute faster but do nothing elseone of the problems with this setup is that the council was a popularity contest where anyone could nominate themselves and with enough votes they got in and then there were a lot of councilors who never voted on a single thing there is no way to kick someone out except by being voted in above them so whipping the council was very importantnow it will be a dynamic council system where you have these subgroups subcouncils dedicated to specific things so rather than one council having the ability to issue any motion now there will be for example a technical council that just does runtime upgrades a treasury council that just approves treasury requests etcin reality a lot of overlap will still exist between the member groups of each council but it looks like it will be much better with people being able to kind of specialize
353874,oh interesting okay yeah the episode definitely wasnt particularly clear on that then edited to add could also just have changed since it was recorded in march
353875,how will having sub councils avoid the popularity contest issue
353876,the same people can only be popular in certain contexts so many times and having contextspecific groups in theory makes sure people argue for their candidacy with actual credentials
353877,so is there no vote delegation at all then that was the whole core point of the podcast and the part i was excited to see how itd work out
353878,no there is you nominate yourself as part of the eg treasury council and then people delegate to you just like they do now on a single council
353879,
353880,will these larps try to recreate the entire vertical and horizontal
353881,no time to explain were going back to irc
353884,ahh okay i see so basically people compete for votes in areas they are actually or at least supposedly qualified for thats cool
353885,yeah in theory
353886,discord sucks on most points for sure but good luck building something similarbetter and web 3 friendly and dealing with all the issues that goes with it
353887,how abt no discord
353888,i cant say im addicted to discord myself now while i litteraly was hating it before but nvm just my 2 cents here this is probably a better convo for the other group
353889,
353890,speaking of
353891,irc could work well with web3 especially as they are developing irc v3 standard for a while now
353893,why thatthey had great hype in the past
353894,weird claim polkadot is the biggest dao alive and active and the recent experiment in reputational avatars doubled the turnout its by far the most active onchain decision making body objectively
353895,its a niche eco with very few users and a big moat but the governance is incredibly successful with over 100 referenda executed successfully over the past year and a half
353898,time to fork keybase with an apechain wallet
353900,will the governance scale as well when it has more users
353901,i dont see why not
353904,nan
353905,i think she answered your question 4th of may
353906,most still dont even with few users its important to have voting power based on turnout plus lockup buffs imo and that works well
353908,incentivizes random voting for the sake of voting completely counterproductive
353909,also its unreasonable to expect every token holder to be into governance
353910,this will be botted and for those who dont know how theyll probably just delegate
353911,they have a 25b reserve
353912,
353913,whats the tetra play here wasnt the goal to have pusd higher to make people to go mint via the protocol itself lp back in ratio restoredarent they breaking the a parameter at first to actually make it imbalanced or am i dumb
353917,i think you might be thinking a little too highly of the average tokenholder some people can and will indeed click on a random choice
353918,or maybe use a bot to vote which is why you see snapshot proposals that youre explicitly told not to vote on so they can filter out bots
353919,exactly
353920,this has been studied pretty extensively at this point and also includes people who hold tokens on cex and such you cannot expect everyone to vote you must not it makes no sense in any system at scale
353921,the system so fsr left seems to be working well but will be infinitely improved with secret voting
353922,comparing it to an actual voting system in a country is pretty legit in this case tbh
353923,not everybody will voteincentivizing voters can lead to botspunishing those who dont vote can lead to the same issue
353925,similar to actual country governance to an extent yeah
353926,i am seeing kp3r market cap is below the protocol treasury despite generating positive cash flows any idea why
353927,dropping this here for if somebody wants to read a bit of defi risk philosophy on sunday
353928,euler_mab might be interesting
353929,do you have a link to this group ser
353930,zulip hehuhuhehee
353931,discord is broken by default its spyware owned by microsoft
353932,there were some examples posted by the mev folks last year where they showed how bots got rekt because they couldnt tell the difference between simulation on a local fork and the real environment
353933,its not even fucking secure
353934,the flipside to this is dai implementation of their own standard permit
353940,sers there seems to be something wrong with lobsterdao daily all links to discussion point to some placeholder channel
353941,is there a way to one time manually generate a random number by sending a txn without writing a contract for callbacks or something
353942,dm
353943,i was trying to consolidate chat eliases and make them cooler and fucked up1 changed the elias of this chat to get a new cool elias lobsterdao 2 in the new one made the current one hence redirect lobsters_chat 3 my account in this chat was fking up and didnt let me change to lobsterdao elias4 so i gave ownership of this chat to my gf account so she could try from her phone5 she had the same issue it must be that elias is linked to the previous owner being louis6 then had to try to transfer to louis since he owned that elias7 gf didnt have 2fa on so she could not change owner again6 have to wait 7 days now aaaaaaa
353944,nan
353945,rekt
353946,alias you mean hmmm kay
353947,now i cant change back the alias aliens elais elias whatever thekimonoofbithumb of this chat rekt
353948,rugged
353949,fixed
353950,alex3pg
353952,huge update
353953,good team
353955,if its an eoa it wont have code in it
353957,i read that on stack overflow for etherjs but wasnt sure if etherscan had a similar mechanism the api docs are pretty sparse its ok for now though manually checked the troublesome wallets thanks
353958,hm feels dumb cant find there any specific linkdescription to sharemaybe by the name blockchain deutschland
353959,microsoft does not own discord
353960,lol
353961,you cant fish an ape but you can definitely phish dozens of them
353962,lmfaoooo
353963,seems like u cant they are ready to provide even the contract code but only if it was verified there anyway i used js script with proxycrawl for scarping bytecodes for similar purpose btw to reduce false positives you can use two checks first with etherjs getcode and second with excodesize and check for non zero results also here
353965,any possibilities to get connected for it
353966,wat
353967,microsoft was attempting to buy discord at one point but the deal didnt go through
353968,yup
353969,still shitty spyware
353970,i have also heard this
353971,any startup willing to sell out to microsoft is shit
353972,why microsoft can take care of it better
353973,you can believe that still wont make it owned by msft regardless
353974,i hate discord as well even have to pay to use stickers and gifs thats scammy someone need to take down discord love tg
353976,wait til telegram rolls out subscriptions for premium stickers
353977,our dao revenue source lfg rich
353978,yeah due to some clues this may happen but due to rumors it will be a paid storage
353979,didnt get it
353981,
353982,starts with onchain orderbooks does not mention oasisdex the disappointment
353983,its an electric shillfest but its not too bad education wise so i shared anyway
353984,tru etherdelta be like how did i end up in this list
353985,is this what happened to blockarray
353986,are there any attempts to build serum like clob on starknet or use unrestricted gas consumption smh in exchange tech
353987,dydx will have to come up with something if is to happen
353988,oh yes they tryin
353990,guysis this on twitter real
353991,banteg milkyklim fake right
353992,people keep asking looks fake
353993,hes addicted to the clout if thats real lol
353994,afaik all of them are fake and he still has his old one which will reactivate in case he wants to appear active again
353995,one guy from fantom said so
353996,i think fake
353997,r people really that desperate
353998,its bear market so yea
353999,i can give u a comic about andre if you want some resolution
354000,always assume fake until proven otherwise
354001,does it make sense for to take off so we know everyone is a human and not a bot i guess it overlyinfringes on privacy
354002,how does it verify someone is human is the method anoncompatible
354004,i dont think so its asking for a video showing your eth address as proof
354005,you submit a video of yourself with the eth address then if there is a dispute it goes to kleros court
354006,but you dont have to give your name address still you need to show your face
354007,nan
354008,nan
354009,nan
354010,reading further down their docs it looks impossible to use as an anon
354011,as the folks mentioned video evidence is needed and then users need to vouch as well as duplicate protection all of which requires your face plastered somewhere on the internet and linked to your wallet
354013,nan
354015,does anyone know what is happening with the fuse hack and whether tribe dao will still reimburse the affected pools
354016,how many chapters of this are there
354017,and where can i find them
354018,to anyone interested in a chat platform purpose built for web3 communities by cryptonative founders
354019,100 not not andres attitude writing style etc
354020,the fact everyone knows he was always gonna come back after quitting again is hilarious
354021,didnt he just release a very lengthy medium article around regulatory defi another reason why it isnt him
354022,unlikely real
354023,likely unreal
354024,unreal likely
354025,promoted lol
354026,cool domain
354027,and name
354028,maybe its a trick to push the real andre to reactivate his account
354029,scam lol
354030,there are 4 chapters one introducing each of the yfu characters the first one is done and will be out soon we have a script for the second one and the overall story arc
354031,hmm why not build it on top of matrix i really wish more apps would start building on top of existing federated protocol instead of coming up with a new federated protocol each time
354032,wheres the money in doing that
354033,are you saying people are not here just for the tech
354034,what tech
354035,my rolex and lamborghini both require technology to work so yes i am here for the tech thank you
354036,comms design is fundamentally different than matrix and potentially incompatible in matrix every user has to manage their own key for e2ee and the matrix server doesnt do key management comm relies on a community keyserver that can reencrypt content given a changing community key setin the case of lobsterdao somebody like ivan would run a comm keyserver on his laptop home server or cloud server this allows the comm keyserver to host applications which are more complex than chat but still have them be securely encrypted for example a photo sharing application or a twitterlike feed these things cant be e2ee on matrix because they have many different participants and there needs to be a keyserver reencrypting the content with all participants keys i admit that my understanding of both comm and matrix is a little bit rusty now but i did learn about why comms architecture is different and it was roughly because of this
354037,maybe i am misunderstanding the semantics but this is entirely possible with matrix too you can have a matrix instance where the keys are not managed by individual participants but managed on server side still need a passphrase so its not like the server controls your encrypted chats the event spec of matrix doesnt assume a chat by default so you can easily adopt it for a number of flexible usecase
354039,yeah i guess it should be possible but i suspect it would require both a custom server and custom client people couldnt properly use it with element and accounts possibly wouldnt even be portable across regular matrix synapsedendrite homeservers and comm keyservers which kind of defeats the point and would make for a poor ux
354040,really unlikely
354041,i agree on the custom client because you would want something that feels web3 native and maps wallets to the 3pid system matrix has but i think it should be fine with the regular matrix homeservers because in this scenario you are not creating a keyserver you are creating a custom client that lets you create an identity that is created using your web3 address and whenever you participate in the larger your matrix ecosystem your homeserver takes care of establishing your identity
354042,nan
354043,nan
354044,same as dovs squeeth is not a deltaneutral isolated farm you cant lp in ribbon and just think apy nor can you do it with any marketdirectional protocol where you sell volatility
354045,last i checked was still being discussed looked likely some form of compensation was going to happen previous time was vested dai that eventually allowed for 11 fei redemption iirc
354046,agree with this although i think in small sizes dovs call selling can be a good source of yield during choppy bearish environments overall tho systematically selling calls will underperform over longrun as the price of any token will jump past the callstrike during bull markets we wrote some research on this a few months back
354048,the fake account doing promo on itself is not andre deleting all references questions about this to avoid flood
354049,coom
354050,ah i ctrlfed but didnt find it here maybe you add its name not the link to your message so ppl could find it
354051,
354053,let him be find some new drama already
354054,never waste a second to call someone an idiot
354055,nan
354057,gemxyz was sold to opensea the nft aggregator vasa has been building
354058,yes
354059,any details on it for how many millions it was sold
354060,dont think they made that public ser
354061,hello guys just wonder does anyone know where can i long volatility
354062,isnt buying the asset itself longing volatility
354063,no because it can be on both sides either downside volatility or upside volatility
354064,yeah realized that after sending it out
354065,you can do it on volmex
354066,damn i love this group
354067,quick n informative
354068,does this have liquidity
354069,not sure yet seems to be minting a vix token of some sort need to check
354070,hi all can you tell me what is degenscorecom
354073,degenscore is the crypto equivalent of credit score for vaccine clinical trials degens people in crypto who invest with an extreme degree of overconfidence who identify new onchain investment opportunities alpha are rewarded with a score based on the projects and the phase in which they invest in a new project earlier they identifyparticipateinvest higher the score the success ratio is similar to vaccine trials and hence the equivalent score per project you have many hits and many misses the score is associated and unique to the participating wallet addressthe score is a great marketing reward mechanism and acts as a marketplace filter for projects to test experiment and identify early investors and many have successfully leveraged the score to create allow lists for investors to become early participantsdegenscore is the only true flex in crypto
354074,sounds interesting its too bad i cant just plug in a wallet address without signing
354075,why its bad tho signing message with your wallet is free and dont create any txs or token approvals
354076,id like to look at how it scores particular wallets but i cant unless i own them
354077,does anyone know how much time do we have to claim wins in pooltogether
354078,why tornado cash only supports 01 1 10 eth txns
354079,because if you deposit 42069 eth then withdraw the exact same amount of 42069 its way easier to track
354080,but it should work just to make it easier they make it limited
354081,whats the point of using tornado cash if you make it easier for others to track you
354082,i remember from somewhere that in v3 they will be able to disclose addresses to law enforcement by community vote it sounds like a bad cringe joke but it is
354083,do you have a linksource for this
354084,sauce
354086,so in order for police to deanon users they have to buy supermajority amount of tokens exit to police
354087,this is brilliant
354088,finally we have the chance to dump on the institution
354089,this is acually cool githubcomnootatomicswap if keep in mind these as well
354090,also curious of source since i dont know how it could be implemented i guess maybe possible with offchain stuff but that seems bad
354091,the search term is collaborative deanonymization tons of such schemes
354092,cool thanks
354093,there was some projects launched after uniswap v3 release to make liquidity management on v3 for devs anyone have to links
354094,visr gelato and popsicle correct
354095,mellow too
354096,charm
354097,wtf is that link can you give some context the text translates to some shit about the buterin family being like a mafia that profits off of ethereum based projects
354099,wtf
354100,thanks
354103,incentive to dump
354104,now visr it called gamma
354105,btw telegram has a builtin translate option you can enable it via settingslanguage interesting channel seems like a tankie though if i am understanding what the message is saying correctly
354107,not really but who knows if it survives now and will be alive during the next bull runcould be interesting
354108,i was being sarcastic sorry it screams scam to me no inflationary measures yet pays out more when mc drops wheres that money coming from what if the market forces that have caused its price to drop also impact the nfts its pegged against
354111,silo finance getting hammered by the investor unlock like what they are doing but tokenomics seems wrong
354112,you can look at floordao and your project is very similar but the actual performance is not ideal
354113,what was the issue with floordao
354114,sers whos going to ethny this june usually there are big coferences that end with top hackathon i found the page with hackathon but i cant find the conferences can anyone suggest place where i can find all crypto conferences and around ethny in particular
354115,hard to say but i think it may be that vault fragmentation nft transaction fees are not enough to support floor long term inflation
354116,fyi if you are using it in your project wwwbleepingcomputercomnewssecuritycriticalatlassianconfluencezerodayactivelyusedinattacks
354117,im not much into tech should i just delete trello app from everywhere
354118,nan
354119,or just use something like openprojectorg or plankaapp i love it
354120,ty man planka looks fantastic never heard about it
354121,i tried to analyze it for the past couple of days but their docs dont make sense whatsoever however someone said that they are merely abusing looksrare incentive system by listing land and earning rewards on it looking at their address it does really seem that they are doing that this shit is hilarious and totally unsustainable though i aped cause i am retarded someone can totally kill the project by sweeping their listed land
354122,floordao is much more sustainable though
354123,how much do you have
354124,anyone know if accepting an offer on a random airdrop nft could cause any negative issues on my wallet
354125,nothing substantial just put 1 eth to support my bags got quite a lot of stupid monkey land please dont ask me why
354126,i have a random nft in my wallet with a 15 eth offer on it
354127,yes it can farm42 wrote a post about this new interaction recently i think might be mistakingtransaction fails hex data gives a link to a scam site scam site initiates a different transaction money gone
354128,any link the only thing i was was that zero day exploit
354129,idk how approving a specific nft contract could cause an issue with anything else
354131,
354132,
354133,literally in the post ser
354134,yeah i found the twitter post after i said that seems not worth the risk
354135,rune exploit is one thing they use txorigin for the most part you are right but also if the offer is too good to be true it is and will fail
354136,seems like elrond received its first flashbot attack more than 800k egld dumped on the onchain liquidity
354137,
354138,is chris full on anti defi now
354140,he was from day 0 idk where u been ser
354141,what he said isnt per se untrue chainlink reliance by almost every protocol is huge there is just no alternative thats as trustedgoodeconomic aka free
354142,maybe mistaken him with someone else but early 2020 learned a lot from him
354144,understand theres no incentive for chainlink to change because the people seriously criticizing their weirdness are few and far between and even then the response to them is basically terra the week before it imploded
354145,band protocol
354146,is it that much different
354147,maybe some chad defi developers will invent a secure dex oracle one day
354148,if your in lobster dao do you get access to the best alfa
354149,mostly twitch soft porn screenshots bad memes crying and 0 alpha
354150,damn was gonna buy a lil lobster guess not
354151,u ll never know if this was psyops or not
354152,
354153,ivan stop using ur own pics for lobsterdao marketing it looks bad on us and next time keep the pokemon thing home or u get mugged
354154,5mil drained from elrond apparently
354155,no one talking about this tho
354156,nan
354157,they just launched their permissionless bridge to eth a few days back chain still has around 250mil tvl according to defillama so more happening there than on some of the hyped l2s but the community is pretty niched indeed
354158,no one taking advantage and shorting tho which is sus
354159,how to buy at this price
354160,saw ftx dipped about 7
354161,you cant dex smart contract is paused and also public api is disabled
354162,you cant they stopped the dex and apis
354163,well the team moved fast to disable things and stop a dump from crowds so the price didnt dip that much some shorted a bit and made profit but i think overall cex liquidity is low around 6 so it can easily be handled by the mm
354164,whats the point of a dex sc if it can be paused by a team not really decentralised
354165,elrond is 100 not decentralized they performed a hard fork last night on all the validators curious to see if they will chain revert
354166,its unfortunate that a product claiming to be decentralized is able to things like this but if we think of the 92 percent price drop they experienced in terms of eth itd be equivalent of ethereum dropping to 130 they might be able to recover now whereas if it had traded at such low prices it couldve been like ichi but now they lose some consumer confidence
354168,jordanalexandermeyer shared already ser grats
354169,same as many other things nothing new under the sun there are other dexs out there albeit with lower liquidity that dont have that function
354170,its cool
354171,the dex is not permisionless even token listings are passed through a process and you cant just add liquidity there and create a pair that has been the status quo for everything that the team built slowly decentralize nobody stops anyone from building products that are permisionless though and there are a few already even other dexs
354172,
354173,hi there whom should i contact regarding listing a new grant program on your page at defillamas wiki
354174,doesnt this mean that solana is literally converging to eoss resource management model
354175,llamaintern
354176,hey like wikipedia the defillama wiki allows anyone to edit pages
354177,noone trades on a dex because it cant be paused thats dumb
354178,people trade on a dex because it has the pair they want its quick enough price is alright its without kyc
354179,yes its open for anyone to edit but i can help with any questions you may have if you want to dm this was a project i helped to initiate
354180,oh ok i know its open for anyone to edit but thought you guys curate that one and wants to ask first all good
354181,just curious what program isnt listed that you are adding in
354183,i just sent a response and it disappeared
354184,there is no need to do it here blz dm sov or do via wiki
354185,unless sovsignal says i am a dick will put it back in then
354186,ha sure thats fine with me i can help just dm me maderaz
354187,im not saying its the reason for why people use it more so its used as a marketing tool by many to claim some advantage by being decentralized when in reality its far from it
354189,is there a place where i can see how much a convex pool had tvl on a certain date
354190,just guessing here can you go to the analytics tab on the smartcontractss etherscan page
354191,usdn pool only has like 40m locked now
354192,im pretty sure it had way more on convex
354193,is there any locker for uniswap v3 liq nft tokens
354194,duality finance launched recently
354195,borrow with those positions
354196,some upcoming

354207,
354214,hey lobs can you point me in the direction of a project if there is any with tokenomics that incentivize the team not only based on the time they keep the project afloat 1 year cliff 2 years unlock you know the deal but also based on the performance of the product eg team has 10 of total supply locked and they get additional 25 if project reaches 50 mil tvl or something like that is this a viable approach for crypto
354215,posted back from yosoymiguel
354216,dont know any projects but sounds like amazing idea we need more accountability in this space
354217,isnt that what umas outcomefinance is all about
354218,we are building carrotethlimo and have an active campaign with atlantisworld they build something for us and unlock the rewardswe are planning to use carrot for distributing team tokens for swapr based on product milestones merged and released
354219,my 000002 btc on this ive been part of a project that gets 10 tax on the farmed token for the dev fund when users are claiming their rewards needless to say that the model doesnt work very well especially if you are looking for a constant flow of funds to be used imediatly
354220,kaurihero
354222,lukso came up with the concept of a reversible icobased on vitaliks ideas of a dao like ico daico where investors can vote on a projects success and milestones and put the ico in a refund state if things go south
354223,radix tried to do something funky with moving averages and token unlocks but afaik that was with retail investor monies i dont think it worked or at least they chose to abandon it and go full unlock
354224,has anyone here used the open gas station network for gasless transactions
354225,thanks for all replies will investigate
354226,yes
354227,i just had a dystopian thought of l1s having exclusive smart contract agreement with dapps seems like easily provable
354228,from going multi chain to solana exclusive
354229,op trying that already with offering perks to those projects that have contracts deployed on their chain only
354232,
354233,wow interesting
354234,soulbound nft
354236,whats the best dex for nfts like the uniswap of nft tradingobvious answer would be opensea seaport or looksrare but smart contract wise they dont support important things like smart wallet signatures i know i know next seaport is fixing itany good underdogs sudoswap
354237,sauce
354238,its debatable whether thats dystopian but you have bigger problems trying to enforce it
354239,the tandem valleyswap swap evodefi bridge has stopped bridging back from the oasis blockchain this comes after the mysterious stability of the valleyswap token which was staying stable for months when the whole market was puking there is over 60m is usdtethbtcusdc still on vs evodefi and vs tg are now closed they are working on the situation evodefi refuse to show proof that they have the funds
354240,could not figure out how vs was able to pay 40 on 80m of vanille tokens usdtethbtc for months without budging now i am thinking that the token was propped to attract funds on the evodefi bridge and steal them unfortunately well find out soon vs is 90 of the oasis blockchain tvl
354242,looks really well done
354243,gemxyz
354244,sorry for removing but the other one has questionable founder ethics
354245,whats the story between genie and gem been trying to find out for ages what went on there
354246,click on demo on mobile please install metamask to use matrixswaplol
354248,gg
354249,this is the first rug pull of a bridge that i can recall really odd
354250,
354251,bridges are much more complex in there design why would you need to do such a high level scam
354252,dont worry itll only affect bad people
354253,not all bridges are the same not saying theirs is simple just that you can easily make functioning bridges through centralization
354254,the scam was fairly basic they hid some funds for reasons and processed transfer normally for months so noone was alarmed
354255,you can function almost indefinitely with say 30 of the funds in fact as long as there is not a mass exit if the farming apr on vs stays high then there is never a mass exit
354256,fractional reserve bankingscamming
354257,it seems so
354258,if its 90 of tvl then oasis is about to implode
354259,it should but im not sure the oasis holder crowd is extremely defi saavy
354260,rather than pure stealing they could also have been ust farming with the funds result would be the same
354261,oh lawdy
354262,if the bridged assets come from ethereum cant you just take a look at etherscan to see where the funds are
354263,not since they moved them through exchanges for reasons
354264,lmao what
354265,by exchanges you mean centralized exchanges
354266,it seems so i havent followed the funds myself
354267,sec investigating whether bnb was a security when sold in 2017 link archive
354268,just saw that one today when i was browsing the airdropincentive program op wiki
354269,dumb question anyone ever use the polygon token bridge successfully
354270,yea
354271,nice is the third approach the right one put the target recipient wallet
354272,i think bridge it to yourself first then operate on polygon send wherever might get complicated otherwise
354274,is it possible for a nft minting contract where a percentage of the users purchase is sent to a charity address in the same transaction
354275,yeah
354276,pretty easy you can do it at each mint or you can do it after all the minting has been done or just call a function to do it manually whenever you want to do it
354277,it would be more gas efficient to do it once but also less trustless
354278,foundation also allows you to do splits so ppl so the profile you share with
354279,well you can have it be trustless in a way where you cant withdraw any money from the contract without sending a percentage to the charity
354280,true that
354281,yeah splits ive forgotten about that project
354282,wts some lobster but still too expensive for me
354284,whats a good account or channel to get most current merge related news
354285,any reason for this sudden death candle on eth
354286,liquidation zone
354287,
354288,adam always coming thru with the good stuff
354289,no dividends so buy back and burn tokens all the way from here on out
354290,damn i feel so stupid thinking it was real andre
354291,about time telegram made added a reaction
354292,i am not sure if this is just perception but it seems in crypto despite having some big players like coindesk etc news wires are super slow i remember when ttd problem happened few weeks ago it took forever to get any kinda coverage same with the bill information asymmetry is a huge problem
354293,well the counter point is crypto moves too fast what you hear now is old news by next morning
354294,frrens why cannot borrow cel on defi
354295,
354296,is there anyone know how to check ath price history of nft which is listed on binance nft marketplace
354298,
354299,whats his motivation behind releasing it lol panama papers
354301,hello devs and defi researchers i would like to introduce a 2month startup to lobsterdao members your critical reviews and comments are highly appreciated
354302,video is not loading
354303,lmao what
354304,farm42 for u ser
354305,lmao
354306,its arbitrage btw not arbitage
354307,
354308,maybe text will be better than that video but from what i understand how is this better than cowswap
354309,cowswap just splits a large amount among several dexes to get the best price and minimise slippage we make one step further and arbitrage other coins not participating in the swap to get more amount out
354310,i am kazakh so make mistakes sometimes where did you find the typo please
354311,thanks sounds super dramatic though
354312,i have and set up relayers on polygon and bsc happy to field questions
354313,so it just routes through other coins
354314,not just routes like cowswap we buy those coins from pairs with stablecoins and sell them to pairs with basis currency to make arbitrage if the basis currency goes up
354315,so basically it abritrages with stables takes the best route aka routing just like uniswap has done forever maybe im missing something here
354316,how does it determine which coins will be bought for arbitrage what about gas costs at what size does this become unfeasible because the gas costs of all the swaps will eat away your arbitrage profit
354317,uniswap is the worst in routing its multihop only routes 100 of tokens one way or another it does not split the transaction into parts 1 inch is a bit better than uniswap study more defi
354318,study more defi oof
354321,
354323,easier if i could read something and not watch some weird 2 minute video to understand i stopped halfway which is why i ask for more clarification not everyone studies defi through weird videos but ty
354324,please avoid vehemence gentlemen ladies
354325,yea is there a way to check the validity of the messages farm42 if it is not a larp are they not in a prime position to fuck anyone or save
354326,great questions the arbitrage happens onchain on the contract however to define which coins to arbitrage we have an offchain monitoring system that tracks all coins on all major dexes and feeds the smart contract with the most suitable assets to arbitrage gas cost are taken into account because there is a limit of number of tokens to arbitrage and and each additional token adds value but also adds to the gas costs so we have to balance this
354327,if you dont like my videos darling you can check this
354328,thanks dear first time hearing about this
354329,im pretty sure this is just a larp this has nothing common with reality actually
354330,great concept the video could be better if you werent here explaining it id have heuristically put it in the scam bucket
354331,its my first video
354332,based on gut feeling or the improbability of such an exploit to begin with
354333,this is impossible true dont fall into cheap psyops guys such exploits are impossible due to tgs infrastructure lol so nothing to add here maybe signal again fudding telegram
354334,excelsior
354336,well one way or another it will for sure be a bumpy ride kek
354337,not to mention whats with the weird slowrelease over weeks what benefit does that have over just dumping everything other than to cause panicfud
354338,built up shorts
354339,thats literally the guys mo spying and making actionable from it but yea feel like an exploit like this wouldve been leaked way earlier especially with all the ukr stuff happening
354340,such things could have been written by a person who is incredibly far from understanding the telegram protocol and its weaknesses which undoubtedly exist but do not look so the task of sowing panic among technically unskilled people is done kudos to a signal team lol and especially to mr snowden
354341,so when is the arbitrage done on each swap also such an arbitrage will be prime for mevbots how do you plan on gaining value beating them
354342,so that everyone can plan and take some time off to read the chats
354343,if you do have the time could you point a few resources as to why
354344,telegram docs zerodium website telegram api why because thats impossible thats why lol
354345,telegram groups are not encrypted are they
354346,theyre not
354347,they claim they have an access to dms which is impossible even though they are not encrypted in e2e
354348,to me this is a big honeypot which aims to track peoples reaction if big accounts will delete they are criminals and has something to hide
354349,oh i thought he was only claiming about groups dms makes it way too improbable
354350,my point in asking was mainly because its always the case that we though something to be impossible and than it might be not that impossible maybe im offbase but wasnt that the case with the recent office 0day
354351,this is smart though
354352,you yourself decide to believe or not to a random twitter larper
354353,such exploits are posted by special media not by anons even if we take recent microsoft 0day case
354354,have you seen this research most interesting findings you are much better off providing liquidity on higher fee tiers eg 30 bps rather than 5 bps all main pairs ethstable btcstable btceth are doing better on uni v2 than passive uni v3 due to the density of the professional market makerssample size has been very well chosen though eth price didnt move much between the 16th of september and the 28th of march which means very low impermanent loss
354355,they start by anons tho
354356,im on the 995 chance its fake but again would like to cover all the bases
354357,there was the only one eternal blue case which looked like that and they simply posted it without any warming up
354358,yep thats why im pressing f to doubt weeks of warming up random person who is dying apologizing to family lots of weird red flags
354359,or its just gonna leak some stuff from like solstarter or some dumb stuff nobody really cares about guess well find out wouldnt trade on any of this tho personally
354360,the arbitrage is done each time the transaction is large enough to move the basis currency this is a special type of arbitrage which is created and captured destroyed by a trader in the same transaction so no transaction no arbitrage mev bots have nothing to eat
354361,1 for doubtthe entire thing seems written in an overly dramatic way plus its stuff likeyou will receive the 7zip archive ahead of time but it will be passwordprotected like whats the point of that typical psychological technique to get someone to believe they hold something real
354362,maybe virus lmao file wont stay fud for long fully undetected not crypto fud so building up largest audience as possible leak file to most gullible boom mass infected and steal all the bored apes takes off tinfoil hat
354363,
354364,yeah like that password protection can hide viruses in certain cases
354365,then boredapes will create a new telegram along side their new discord so everyone can live safely ever after
354366,tbh its for sure a larp if he had anything he would have released an excerpt today to provide some veracity to his claims
354367,sounds like nsa psyop to force cryptobros use signal
354368,yeah also was thinking about it lol
354370,oh i see the arb opportunity itself is created due to the large swap and its settled within the same transaction what about the capital for the arbs flashloans
354371,hmm tho cowswapcow protocol batch auction mechanism is not just about aggregating external liquidity from other dexetc the most important part is surely the p2p trading coincidence of wants cow actually the part where solvers use external liquidity and acts like a dex aggregator comes after not having found any cow
354373,whats wrong with signal
354375,
354377,ez
354378,
354379,kicked from the gated chat
354380,are the houses equipped for wireless electricity also are we talking about a 2 dimension space or 3 dimension
354381,yes you are right the extra capital we will take from our pools from wowswapio our first product
354386,thats dumb so if i live in the middle and the guy in the left house has a leak and needs to close off his water i lose my water too
354387,they clarified it later
354388,guys please use lobster gated chat for autism tests this is becoming hard to moderate
354389,maybe 2 people complaining get them to fix it faster
354390,maybe but sign me out of that shitty suburb lol
354391,the wonders of modern day suburbias combined with developer cost cutting
354392,whats fxsfpis pe ratio so to speak how to calculate
354393,uma kpi options product i think goes into that direction setting goals to be reached which unlock rewards to the teams
354395,as an option
354396,maybe sam knows this one or where to calculate itasked in frax
354398,interesting will study it thanks
354400,wtf
354401,this is not spam per se but wtf
354402,sank you for your patience

354461,only possible with gnosis safe
354462,dynamite thanks will take a look
354463,
354466,
354467,intersting is this just for evm chains
354468,yes
354469,you can check it here
354470,like anyone is going to go through 137 gb of data let alone be able to download it
354471,how is downloading 137gb a problem thats like 4 blueray movies
354472,
354473,i think it may be theoretically possible if the owner of some group bot like rose cryptowhalebot or smth similar was logging messages of certain users in the group
354475,yeah but he may be saying that to hide the real source
354476,1inch did buy one of the hugely used telegram verification bots forget which one
354477,shieldy i think
354478,but most private groups wouldnt be using those types of bots
354479,rose or smth
354480,he doesnt claim to have data from private groups though does he he just says he scraped data from groups withou joining thats not really spectacular
354481,you can just go to any group browse through the messages and see the participants without joining just no private groups
354482,most yeah maybe but almost every private group im in has some kind of bot price checker of gayness calculator or smth like that xd
354483,nan
354484,seems like larp shit from an anon acc those expose accounts usually have nothing lets fin this i agree w cia here
354485,they can just set up this also restrict sharing content
354486,yep he said he found out how to create an invite link to any group
354487,this is a newish feature though
354488,how long would it take someone to just bruteforce all possible invite links
354489,he basically refers to an old osint trick when link were formed without aaaa mask and were able to be brute forced via hex redactor if knowing user id fixed 3 years ago
354490,thats how feds in russia doxxed political channel admins just vice versa
354491,you were able to convert user id to a join chat link and vise versa thats what i mean it has been fixed once it was posted publicly a lot time ago nothing to add here
354492,to me this is a big honeypot which aims to track peoples reaction and behavior patterns if big accounts will delete they are criminals and has something to hide easy
354493,haha i remember i created a private group and posted a link to it in another small private group which had a gayness calculator bot and 3 bots joined the first group immediately after that
354494,can you make a forwardeable post in your channel ser
354495,this is currently impossible and works only with old links without aaaa mask fixed by telegram a long time ago
354496,because i think the same but my channel admins are freaking out as soon as they wake up and i dont want endless deleting of the bait and youre the one to listen to
354498,np will use anonfacebot and put the respectable anon opinion append
354499,farm42 if youre bored of this panik got something totally unrelated i wanted to talk with you about check dms
354500,where to check on chain liquidation date
354501,alex3pg why you are deleting my messages
354502,cenzorship
354503,nope just trying to avoid politics and war drama talks here
354504,its not relevant
354505,the block twittertelegram says lurid twitter claims have all the hallmarks of a hoaxby ajrummer
354506,u can see the tx time stampor u mean something different
354507,nan
354509,a spokesperson for telegram poured cold water on the lurid tales telling the block that the post has all the hallmarks of a hoax and the purpose of the text is likely to make gullible people download some malware that steals your private keys
354511,i mean how to check the liquidation data of these loan platforms such as aave
354512,this is helpful
354513,ser where a smol brain no coding shrimp like me can check past comp distribution to its markets like how much comp the usdt market got in octdec21

354526,also thats a fuck load of de fuk u gonna do w it
354527,airdrop on lobsterdao duh
354528,airdrop
354529,for the dao to decide init
354530,treasury round the rd company doesnt get a penny
354531,rd firm then gets hired by dao
354532,euler_mab ser
354533,if the dao would like to hire rd company services i think that might make sense in the early years
354534,posting here since i dont see it discussed a lot packing a payload with a huge file is an old trick still working to avoid most av scans
354535,so how does the rd lab sustain until then
354536,ser we know u r bound my nuh law dont worry
354537,joel_john u know the answers lol
354538,i escaped commercialgrade avs with files 160mb during security assessments
354539,im doing research for gerabox
354540,euler xyz raised a series a round from paradigm last year and were tight so its not running out of cash anytime soon devs get paid in doge
354541,rd will ofc apply for grants as soon as its primary funding runs out which is logical imho
354542,yup what michael says all makes sense
354543,wait you guys actually take payments in doge
354546,
354547,100 says hell make it back in less than 2 years
354548,yeah gonna make it in 2 years and gonna lose it after 2 days
354550,for anyone that has lost money like that realise you have soft asset that is the skillset and assuming you made that money on research networking collab etc all those are worth way more than the you lost sometimes losing some money gives the drive to go ham obv market conditions different now but giving up after doing a 100x is like a short on yoruself not everyone does that unless u bought like btc in 2012 and slept till 2020 or something dont discount the hard skils you make along the way
354551,how can you say that futures arent gambling
354552,so youre saying bulla will be back in less than 2 years
354553,great pls send me the last liquidation i facedalmost xxm
354555,the first reason why futures are existinghedging your positionsyou have an asset but dont wanna sell it you can short it and be neutral

354562,hello everyone just made this public dune dashboard all about optimism dexs data if youre interested
354563,
354565,hellocan someone explain me how can i calculate my impermanent loss in univ3
354566,check
354568,ty
354569,thanks but i want such data and dont know where to find it
354570,parsecfinance has liquidations data but not sure if in this format
354571,hey folks were doing an hour livestream with ed snowden about crypto privacy in 1h if ya wanna watch
354572,on april 26 2022 aurora labs received a bug report with critical severity affecting the aurora engine if exploited would allow to mint an infinite supply of eth in the aurora engine
354573,thank you
354574,its so ironic that you would say this given that both ethereum and bitcoin full nodes need hundreds of gb of data to be downloaded
354575,been trying to google for telegram aaaa mask to understand what that is but cant find anything probably because aaaa and mask are terrible search termscan you plz help ser
354576,  id           tmejoinchat           tmejoinchataaaaa

354578,unfortunately in russian but you can use deeplcom or built in translator this has been fixed already thats why i post it op took an old and not actual trick and tells this is a new one
354580,
354581,hm
354582,lets please stop this stuff we got it
354585,good luck people just leaving this here
354586,us paypal users can now transfer send and receive cryptocurrencies including bitcoin ethereum bitcoin cash and litecoin
354587,
354588,it can scale but can it compose
354589,considering the article says neither
354591,does she have tech capabilities always thought she was more like a visionary fundraiser
354592,i suppose she has a linkedin or something never bothered to check but she was always good at these longform explanatory articles was actually surprised to see her writing about crypto stuff again
354593,if the question is wrt whether she would know whether it can actually scale its just math
354596,guys anyone has any model to compare what should be the realized daily volatility or price movement of a pair ex eth usdc in order to do breakeven with the given apror to make it in another way what should be the daily return that make breakeven vs the il in an eth usdc lp or even better to transform everytjing in realized vol il vs iv apr terms
354597,
354598,the official text has been released
354601,what are the next steps for it to be implemented any burger specialist in here seems like needs to be approved by house of reps then senate then president
354603,needs to pass congress various committees senate not vetoed by the prez etc gonna take time
354604,theyll probably carve it up a few times
354605,not synchronously no
354606,there has got to be a better pre processor for these legacy contracts this bill is written like a git diff
354607,a in file 6 line 5 character 7 remove the parenthesized clause b in file 6 line 5 character 6 add the text
354608,a include the text of hr 69420 in its entirety
354609,like no wonder our laws are so fucked up this process needs multiple humans to just interpret what the final text of the law would be after this change
354610,also now will be the time for lobbies to try and get their stuff in so the final form of it by the time it passes will be way different than what it is right now
354611,jfc
354612,hey guys we are currently trying to explore all the decentralized social media for our researchwe currently know about these protocols calaxycomcan you please help us in adding more here for an unbiased deepdive we want to cover every deso protocol out therethank you
354613,subsocialnetwork
354614,thank you
354615,
354616,
354617,thanks guys
354618,hey my friend feiwian made a loong thread talking about all these active and upcoming web3 social media i hope this can help you and everyone interested in this topic
354619,thank you fren very helpful
354620,
354621,
354622,7 is quite a lot to pay actually
354623,how are they making it a competitive purchase
354624,no need to be fully collateralized serious reputational damage in case of default quite a competitive purchase imo
354625,what do you mean
354626,like i said at the end of the thread im missing a lot of projects but that is what i had a few weeks ago there are more to come in the v2 10 projects already noted zeroaxelol lorenzord
354627,
354628,they already have a lot of input there is a letter from the industry that accompanies the bill on lummiss website
354629,has anyone seen a decent overview of this whole thing anywhere
354632,did he say he downloaded from private groups or that he was in those groups
354633,he said he wasnt in the groups but managed to scrape them through this exploit
354636,ending the day as promised twittercomtelegramstatus1534263475509288961
354637,scroll above both jake and lex shared
354638,we do have a pretty good list now thanks to the people here
354639,how does it work with gnosis safe
354640,jfyi in the early days of telegram telegram team had access to any private messages group chats of targeted users and it was used for the insideteamwarfare so claims dont seem totally meaningless but they are 99 a stupid attention fishing
354641,vaevictis321 already discussed sir
354642,thats a pretty serious accusation do you have a credible reason or a proof for saying that telegram team did insider attacks
354645,
354646,europoors which is where i was born and live unfortunately have none of that
354647,you guys have bitstamp
354648,i use bitstampwhat bad about it
354649,nothing bad just said thats what folks in eu generally use vs paypal
354650,ah yes thats true basically kraken and bitstamp for fiat gateways
354653,hop contract deployed
354654,damn
354658,we have been talking about it 2 days ago
354659,how is getting paid for a service you have built scammy not defending discord but honestly this attitude of calling something scamming that is trying to generate revenue instead of just doing ads is one of the reasons that has led to current state of constant surveillance
354660,and for the record telegram has ads which i think is an worse experience than having to pay for stickers and gifs
354661,never seen any telegram ad running anywhere
354662,
354663,they typically only occur in large channels not groups
354664,and channel author cannot make anything with this only make channel private then it hides
354665,btw a little self promotion i have a bot that can help you hide private channel behind a public username portalkeeperbot it essentially works like a portal you have a public groupchannel that essentially works like a portal to your private groupchannel and people have to go via a captcha if they want to join atleast in its present form next release will make it optional its pretty much in alpha right now where i dont recommend if you want a stable product but a new public release of it is coming soon with more functionalities limiting the number of people that can join whitelist blacklist joins via tokennft verification etc
354666,tribe vetoed fuse reimbursement after the vote to reimburse and waiting a month and half
354667,nah thats fud
354668,nan
354669,not fud ser
354670,
354671,is it a feature or a bug that chains are just halted on a centralized will solana atleast is in beta and halts without them wanting it lol
354672,you can also read about juno whale other feature of ibc chains

354682,
354683,hey guys do you know any decentralized bridge or exchange for wrapping btc to eth network
354685,sirlayer 3 is basically dappchain or l2 on top of l2 or private rollup on top of l2your l3 is actually an application layer
354686,what about skale network l2 or l3
354687,rotor_s5 why deleted it was nice picture about how web3 infralayers structured
354688,renbtc
354690,
354691,i have never heard any of the layer 0 examples being classified as anything other than layer 1
354692,ive actually heard cardano classified as layer 1 before instead of 0
354693,no thats not layer 3
354694,
354695,layer 3 i believe was kinda coned by starknet primarily and thats not app layer
354696,guthl can correct me there
354697,right it cant be exploited because its sc doesnt work
354701,this is terrible
354702,layer 0 is networking layer
354703,at least again if we argue by narratives set up in 2019 kinda
354704,bloxroute describes their network layer as layer 0
354705,lobsterdao is layer 1 because we are the social consensus layer
354707,may i delete this article the person is very dumb writing such stuff
354708,its a hit piece by random twitter account
354709,nan
354710,delet
354711,nan
354712,avalanche cosmos etc are not layer 0
354713,do you know any other bridges that one have big fees
354714,it does not have to be dapp specific it is just a rollup on top of a rollup
354716,layer 0 networking layer no consensus just packets etc previously started as a narrative by marlin bloxroute back in 2019layer 1 the usual blockchains with consensus slapped as you know em avalanche cosmos ethereum bsc etclayer 2 optimism arbitrum starknet etc rollups not plasma anymorelayer 3 was previously used as a joke for app layer but later on trasnformed by starkware into another stack piece this changed over time so did the definitions but at least l0 and l1 never really changed in their meaning there is still no development in l0 cause u need to make miners trust you so blabla maybe u can even stick flashbots as l0 to an extent l2 had changes as plasmarollups were developing l3 is very new nothing new i mean the narrative is newer but from the tech perspective it seems more like a new starkware piece than an app layerwith regard to ibcpolkadot parachains i dont think it ever got a new name its not really networking but kinda is maybe avalanchecosmospolka are l15i do not know coding and i never made a blockchain
354717,
354718,added w regard to ibcpolkadot parachains i dont think it ever got a new name its not really networking but kinda is maybe avalanchecosmospolka are l15
354719,cause like u do get intercomms between your chains and subnets or whatever but then you get similar with rollups and rollups are not l0
354720,nan
354721,muh internet stack
354722,
354723,thnx u for networking 101 recap
354724,nice thread to add to this yes thank u sub to polynya
354725,market confirmedlobsters are discussing tech stack classifications instead of daily alpha
354726,ahahhaha ccr vibes of summer 2018
354727,inb4 perlin new muh code is coming in and dorjee takes 5m yearly director fee fking scammer cockface
354728,
354729,this guy too ser he is a chad
354730,on the osi model the entire stack ivan described above would fit within the application layer
354731,thx ser i spent weeks writing the report and 4 hours yesterday making the tweet
354733,great job with it
354735,thank you i wish they had better internal communication infrastructure all my requests for comment were ignoredkinda a shame i dont want to shit on ppl needlessly hopeful that when we come around and rereview i can actually talk to someone other chains are being more cooperative in this regard in responding to my thoughtswant defi to be safe thats all i help it by boosting transparency rn solana processes are not transparent
354736,my brain cells are growing back need more bera
354737,except layer 0 i guess because that will be the transport layer
354738,it is possibly just application logic that routes data accross the transport layer rather than making any adjustments to the transport tcpip udp etc layer itself same same i guess for vpn software
354739,hmm i was assuming layer 0 more about the nodes communicating with each other which mostly utilizes tcpudp but thats a fair point
354740,some blockchains do separate out the consensus layer such as oasis network this would fit the model youre suggesting a bit moreat the end of the day these abstractions are mostly useful for devs to grasp a highlevel understanding before digging into the weeds but then traders come and shoehorn their project into the model to try make it seem revolutionary
354743,
354744,
354745,thanks for the confirmation after a while you get to doubt yourself with all the content out there
354746,looking for developers to make something like this pm me
354751,
354752,we just talking now about diagram visualization toolsmy fav is excalidrawwhich drawing tools u guys usesame question for animated drawings
354753,is this date confirmed
354754,saw truefi just launched on optimism
354755,i think thats first uncollateralized lender on l2
354756,
354757,only for alameda co afaik so what does this change
354758,you seen it lately lends to b2b fintechs emerging market funds even has a real estate portfolio with teller
354759,nan
354760,lol deleted
354761,
354763,lets call them credit protocols more inline with boomer lingo
354765,ser u been early and have traction yes but what is the difference from the usage perspective if the only thing users can do is gib money to big guys
354766,does it really matter what chain you are on i wouldnt think so idk
354767,no shade on truefi btw you should have rather shared the b2b fintechs emerging market funds even has a real estate portfolio
354768,how can i sheck the aum on those
354769,i also would almost bet that they dont need that service
354770,they get free coins w no risk or collateral so its fine for them
354771,but that has been the main argument against gib money to insitutions protocols
354772,altho truefi nd maple have quite some in em and traction
354773,mikegas feel free to ser
354774,sample
354775,tbh id love a loan on property but me no have job banks hate me us
354776,nan
354777,tbh truefi gotta enable loans for lobster holders to silence ivan
354778,i agree
354779,nan
354780,hahaha welp cant solve for creditworthiness with unsecured lending gotta be bona fide but for usdchomes theyll happily take your crypto for partial collateral
354781,it changes how much users can lend to be profitable after discounting gas cost which is quite some deal because these loans have generally higher interest rate than typical stablecoin defi
354782,main value prop on noninstitutional side is yields 16 on real world assets right now good enough for frax and maker to put 100m each in most of all because the risk is well understood
354783,ya this opens great lending rates to small global lenders who were othwreise losing yield to gas fees yields competitive with anchor but with risk you can actually model and understand
354784,was wondering is there a mirrored wrapped token risk on l2s vulnerable tokens as there are on alt l1s
354785,is there any insurance for this kind of risk platform
354786,think bridges are the main attack vector just something ones gotta swallow if trying to to l2 and doing it wo token native to chain
354787,depends on the portfolio theres 10 now some protected by safu staked tru some by nexus mutual others uninsured
354788,in all cases default collections action pursuant to enforceable lending agreement signed onchain
354789,bridge security is a hard swallow especially for conservative people looking for conservative yield so even if you can service more users that slice is also reduced by the fact that people with low capital do not go for relatively low yields
354790,i see in hop doc they have htokens described as crossnetwork bridge token that is transferred from rolluptorollup and are claimed on the layer1 for the underlying asset it is an intermediary bridge token that allows trustless swapsthe end user doesnt need to deal with h tokens directly they only deal with the respective rollups canonical tokencanonical tokens are layer1 token that is being bridged on layer2 for example dai token on layer2 is the canonical token of dai token on layer1 users can send back and forth between layer1 token and layer2 representation of that token using the layer2s official token bridgeso is there a risk with these htoken similar to eg multichain bridge or nahdo tokens on l2 inherit the security of l1s token if l1 native
354791,dont need to bridge tru to play can just optimismnative usdc
354792,yic_alex
354793,and if such vulnerability exist is it limited to the bridge itself or can it be exploited at the token level to eg deplete a lending platform
354794,tokens in lending platforms are whitelisted
354795,your funky bridge token will simply not go in of course there are exceptions where the canonical bridged token is funky like weth on gnosis which rekt hundred finance and the other one
354799,yeah was specifically thinking of the hundred finance gnosis instancebut i m asking in theory does this risk exists on l2s as well if not that s a big immediate benefits of l2s over alt l1s
354800,the risks are the same token x does not after all automagically pop into existence when an l2 is made
354801,nan
354802,some decentralized but not crypto projects that are technically advanced and live scuttlebot tox matrix
354803,radiclexyz
354804,they are actually cryptography based but they are not leveraging blockchains
354805,
354806,live stream of the ropsten merge hopefully
354807,
354808,paulframbot congrats ser
354809,ahhhhhh fuck i think i forgot to update the ttd on my nodes
354812,vpepo have it ser here
354813,i ctrlf euler and didnt pop 3
354814,vitalik casually reviewing our latest oracle research
354815,
354816,velodrome finance explaineranalysis i wrote
354817,hey guys have been researching about blockchain scalability have written a thread on layer 2 solutions to dig deeper into it would love some feedback on it
354818,
354819,your gas analysis completely misses opcode repricing
354820,also probably good to partition any analysis pre and post hardforks
354822,when did this place become a link to your twitter post space
354823,doesnt this simply yield for projects what is eventually an extremely expensive market making service
354824,anyone have some sort of count down timer for ropsten
354825,like block counter
354826,if you can afford that expense methinks youd be better off avoiding the funny games related to incentivizing liquidity and just own it outright ohm may have done many things wrong but it did that one right
354827,wen merge wen wen merge
354828,can you access it
354829,how much do you need for a reasonably priced aquarium these days
354830,need 2 milly for smth nice

354834,cool song
354835,
354836,
354837,just show vitaliks penis already
354838,please help ropsten increase hashrate sooner

354841,4 blocks
354842,panda askee will tell us
354843,4 blocks to 5k eth
354844,ser this is ropsten
354845,thanks stolen
354846,btw is merge on testnet based on block height or difficultly like main

354859,and solana has the biggest web3 app in the world
354860,nan
354861,those are facts
354862,ropsten classic soon
354863,cant delete facts
354864,nan
354865,lets go
354866,of not its down all the time why would it need a merge
354867,nan
354868,lfg
354869,what now
354870,we rich
354871,5k
354872,for test net eth
354873,fud 10k at least
354877,ok ok i dont want mess with vibe eth go upp
354878,guys why isnt eth pumping yet
354879,what if
354880,testnet ser
354881,dump
354882,maybe eth testnet is pumping
354883,testnet eth is like ethereum classic except its not
354884,no shit sir lol
354885,is pumping
354886,kek cmon guys merge just happend and you talking about price fucking christ
354888,you make vitalik wanna cry
354889,absolute morons agree
354890,eth is going to 3 digits
354891,nan
354892,looks like a pump to me tbh
354893,i mean still better than ust
354894,in what exchange please
354895,ok enough was fun back to work
354896,buy the shitty nft see info in lobsterdao to meme w fellow seafood mod back on in here cheers
354905,10 min silence please
354907,meditation time
354908,lobsters also deserve protection from being cooked alive on aave
354909,
354910,yeah i was so stupid to be kind thats insane i cannot believe in it already contacted rekt hq chat admin waiting for a reply
354911,ouch sad and crazy
354912,jfc wow
354913,that proves that even the best can fall if they catch you off guard sucks ball man best of lucks with that
354914,this is fucked up
354915,what do you think guyswhat exactly must be changed in terms of ux on ropsten now
354916,gas fees are same
354917,and i dont even know how to prove it
354919,already shared all possible info
354920,havent heard that during the call hmm
354921,fud
354922,ok ty
354923,same likely pleb larp well see
354924,i mean not bullshit but def a read of situation and not straight facts
354925,whomst else watched the ropsten testnet merge happen live
354926,maybe they are talking about the reorg from before
354927,nothing except the block reorgs are over now lol
354928,reorgs can still happen just not as frequently
354929,yeah
354930,you just cant probably will need to trust the social layer and built reputation nonetheless a big lesson to everyone ping me if i can help you in any way
354931,check dm
354932,but no more hashrates messing the blocks like what happened right before the merge lol
354933,the 7 blocks one afaik it wasnt because of hashrates but update on business logic thats supposed to prevent the new type of reorg with the fancy latin name
354934,
354935,ok cool thx for confirmation
354937,oh shit didnt realize that wasnt a joke best of luck cia
354938,if it was 14 days ago telegram by default only saves admin activity for 2 days some bots like combot can be configured to save it for longer but thats on a casebycase basis afaik
354939,it does store all the users youve ever seen in a group so if you can remember any components of his name rekthq admins might be able to help you
354941,does anyone know where can i find a bar chart with error margins for eth andor btc with cluster groups like miners investment funds developershigh net worth individuals china lmao etc time series would be awesome
354942,public companies now hold over 7 of bitcoin in circulation link
354943,just came to mind after seeing this
354944,
354946,any good incubators people here recommend are they even good idea for early stage
354947,please ctrlf first
354948,i think it depends what you need identify the kind of support you need early stage and then see what the incubator offers and if they meet that sometimes they can be great but ive also seen them be big time committmens that if youre already unfocused will keep you unfocused
354949,i like evolve capital they arent a true incubator more of a shop but they do real marketing help you raise from real longterm investors they also help with compliance and product market fit
354950,theyre a small group of degens but theyre winning a lot of respect from chainlinks startup space and a lot of other good names
354953,thanks for the reply and i will be sure to ctrl f
354954,i guess yes
354957,
354958,curious how did the guy discover the address
354959,holy fuck
354960,my op airdrop bags dead
354961,rugged again
354962,its very interesting and savage how indeed doing a chain halt likely doesnt justify rescuing 20m op
354963,cause then fudders and proponents of shitchains will get insane ammunition for years to come with such a case
354964,sad stuff really
354965,by noticing big amount of op moving
354966,lmfao
354967,exactly
354968,was it like an instant creation of a conract that can probably be checked blz check
354969,they had deployed the token contract some time before so people were bound to be watching but still very speedy move to deploy the multisig to the target address in time
354970,assuming the gnosis factory contract has the same address on optimism then the hacker just had to brute force to the right nonce to get the desired address addresses of smart contracts are the output of 2 inputscreatorpubkeynonce can anyone confirm this was the method used to get control of the 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 address on optimism
354971,so either price is rekt or governance is rekt no
354972,price rekt not per se is 2 of the fdv not small but i agree with op would also prefer to not halt than attack chain at its birth
354973,wintermute promises to buy the tokens from the hacker once that happens back to normal
354974,the crazy thing is they knew about this before the airdrop claim and went through with it anyway
354975,so there was a 9 day difference between tokens coming in and contract creation
354976,nan
354977,damn
354978,we could have all made it s
354979,the second test was a million op
354980,u guys are so smart im enlightened
354981,vmihov we late
354982,omfg and no details about the terms of the grant like 20m for mm any more details appart from the fuck up
354983,another inside job
354984,
354985,dog eats dog
354986,more explanation on how its done
354987,embedded option interest rate aaaaaaaanyone muh collectivism
354988,usually mm contracts like wintermute gsr jump etc working with daos on loan structure not shitcoin mms from 2018 are as follows loan of tokens for 123 years the other side of the orderbook be it eth usdc or whatever is on the balance sheet of the mm they take the risk all profits go to mm in this case tokens at maturity date need to be repaid in full boom call option to buy at xyz price later onsee here
354989,
354990,added an example
354991,this is usually where the gamble takes place
354992,why do people always do this a smug threatening tone doesnt sit well with people
354993,its basically 8 of the current circulating supply im curious if the hacker dont sell and decide to get active on governance
354994,
354996,yes i know but i want the terms for this precise deal as i was until 2 min ago part of the collectivism kek
354997,ah this deal wasnt made w the dao it seems so terms are private to op wintermute
354999,so instead of wintermute dumping a hacker dumped whats the difference
355000,20 mill
355001,so hacker dumps less
355003,1m only so far
355004,bullish
355005,nono u got it wrong this is specific foundation business not dao loan
355006,hence there was no voting its companys tokens
355007,
355008,fine fine but still
355009,you wont get it
355010,such hopium much lol
355011,its discretionary business so not still sowwy
355012,the most entertaining outcome
355013,itd be much lulz if this bro becomes a delegator
355014,sometis
355015,wait i was wrong
355016,nan
355017,they discovered the issue before the launch
355018,thats the crazy part why not just scrap that token and start over if before deployment makes no sense
355019,if only some sort of private transaction submission system existed on op
355020,20m just sitting there on the blockchain waiting for someone to take them you cant make this up
355021,
355022,nice thread
355023,because they where so sure noone else could open the gnosis contract
355024,wow this is really crazy to me huge fuck up by everyone involved
355025,i like how they scheduled retrieval i mean even if you think that others can not recover the funds why not do it immediately
355026,wow just wow
355027,
355028,discovering it would be super easy in hindsight they were a huge token holder and an eoa
355029,check mainnet activity and realize it is a gnosis safe
355030,contracts can be created at the same address on different chains with completely different code and as a result completely different ownersis it possible we will see more attacks using this vector in the future
355031,may be they thought you need access to the private key of the original creator eoa which is not the case create will use the current nonce and the address of the factory to compute the address of the multisig
355035,i dont want to open a can of worms but is this really an exploit and because you own an address on one chain does that mean you have rights to it on every other chain
355036,this is a smart contracts address not eoa
355037,whats the point of sending test txs if you dont assert that you can move the tokens on the receiving address
355038,funny thing is they did 2 test txs
355039,may be the verifier didnt switch to optimism in the gnosis ui when checking
355040,
355041,he is back with his own thesis
355042,if tokens arent in your wallet are they yours you sent them to another wallet someone steal your keys basically sent them to an open access wallet
355043,what i dont understand if tokens where send to a not already created smartcontracthow is that even possible and how someone finds out that its a not controlledcreated contract
355044,im more interested in optics than semantics what really happened is wintermute screwed up bad and theyre masquerading this as an attackexploit when they sent something to the wrong address basically
355045,i assume every address smartcontract or not is already thereright
355046,nah he kinda owned it blockminded
355047,you can send tokens to any address you can think of
355048,correct address just open access one so even bigger blunder wrong address might have been better
355049,yeah wintermute are owning it but optimism are spinning a different narrative
355050,sounds like wintermute is optimistic and optimism is wintermute
355051,i think this is clearly theft exploit is another question their analogy of leaving a bag of money around seems apt to me
355052,you can bet on this since many are not educated enough to understand the difference between eo and sc across chains
355053,they need to draw attention away from the fact they already knew about it and did airdrop anyways
355054,why they gave facts as they are only loser here is wintermute thats it
355055,they ll buy back all safu
355056,so every wallet dapp analytics must consider that in general case address on multiple chains can be owned by different owners or is it more as an edge case
355057,except for all the dmg done to token price due to people selling the news
355058,contracts not regular addresses
355059,whos going to buy that back d
355060,sir this definitely makes op a loser on optics front could have avoided all of it by creating new token before drop
355061,they didnt leave a bag of money around in the openthey delivered it to the wrong house not saying the guy receiving it should keep it but also dont think they should be painted as hackerman
355062,what if hacker ends up not selling
355063,can he influence governance _
355064,true for contacts not for regular eoa addr
355065,not even really a hacker
355066,safe setup frontrunner d
355068,yesbut if you put contract address on debank now they will show the full portfolio as you are the single owner
355069,that is actually an interesting discussionwho owns the address before anything was deployed there
355070,i agree i think this is even less clear than the ndx thing
355071,
355072,possession 910ths of the law as old saying goes is a very interesting situation crypto never disappoints for new problems lol
355073,or maybe problems that shouldve never been a problem in the first place
355074,technically each address has a private key that should be able to sign transactions once a contracts is deployed in the address i suppose the private key wont be valid any more brute forcing the private key is impossible though
355075,someone usually has to be the canary in the coal mine though so next guy doesnt make same blunder
355078,forta will airdrop their token wallets that solved ethernaut ctf challenges also qualify for it
355079,who else
355080,forta contributors gnosis safe active signers
355081,
355082,never a dull day
355083,aka they got found out and had to gib back funds
355084,
355085,omfg
355086,real eyes realize real lies
355087,he burned 10m dai
355088,quantitative tightening
355089,holy shat
355090,he got it back tho
355091,today is definitely a crazy day maybe one of the craziest
355092,clown day fr wintermute gets frontrun on their own safe firestake accidentally hack instead of audit kaineth accidentally burns 10mare we ready for mainstream adoption anon
355094,was going to post firestake but you mentioned it my bad new web3 lingoexploting bugs providing for familyrugging learningfounders ghosting decentralizing
355095,kain and makereao recovered the 10m dai back then
355096,he just put it in a new bad context
355097,were early
355099,on the good stuff side ropsten merge gitcoin grants round 14 started i took a shower
355100,most impressed at point 3 personally im still working on that
355102,because tokens sent to any address is just an accounting update on the token contract it doesnt matter if an contract exists there or not
355103,a nice song was sung yes i just posted this to engagement bait yall
355104,wait i thought contract addresses were derived from the deployer key and nonce
355105,some more tech explanation of op hickup
355106,4 took a picture of a birds
355107,thats for contract addresses that are deployed by an eoa not contracts that were created by a factory
355108,ah right thats what i was missing ty
355109,
355110,damn its really called volt wonder if that will affect the fei stablecoin of the same name
355111,mega mind hacker how the heck he knew this most likely he was hoping something like this to happen and he was waiting already
355112,volt is a cpi pegged inflation resistant token
355113,yeah but they market it as a stable coin
355114,anyone know when they switched to factory using create2 deployments by default
355115,tbh it was sitting there for 9 days i guess that people that are doing black hats have a lot of alarms and systems in place to nudge them for any juicy rewards
355116,many people interested in the airdrop will most probably have found it by checking holder and then checking who that address possibly was on mainnet
355117,more wild stuff is how wintermute scheduled a date to recover the assets instead of actually doing it
355118,or optimism just launching a new token
355119,so wild to me i guess they incorrectly thought it was create2 so no rush but still
355120,launching new token might have been hard and definitely not ideal since they gave it a magic address not sure how that works
355121,checklists are important
355122,dunno personally i will prefer 8 of the supply over a magic address
355123,hypothetically how exactly do they networkupgrade your tokens away
355124,op ded can devs do something
355125,good question do they think of making op in that wallet becoming soulbound
355126,not 100 sure but the nodes are based on geth ethereum nodes and they have the bytecode of contracts i guess you can override it with diff bytecode that removes the balance from the attacker probably can think of it like an erc20 upgrade only at the node level if only optimism runs their nodes at the moment it shoudlnt be difficult its a local update on their infrafor ethereum a similar change would mean a hard fork probably missing some details
355128,they could probably introduce a new state root altho optimism had promised before no more regenesis
355129,hi
355130,funny thing i think elrond just did that after their hack earlier this week without blinking
355131,lmao hacker sent another 1m op to vitalik
355132,network upgrade stfu try to deal with the situation and stop saying stupid stuff on twitter
355133,yeah im looking forward to their article explaining what happened
355134,hola try that one
355135,
355136,thanks for the share i share your share at mc dao
355137,seen that already they dont know what happened either
355138,vorot93 is shark behind the iron curtain still ongoing or has it been censored
355139,looks like a flashloan isnt it or u are tryin to look deeper
355143,will there be any legal issues or will it violate tc if i am putting medium articles or any other blogging website on my website for educational purposes just linking those on my website
355144,you shld check their terms of service
355145,i blv u retain rights to anything u write on medium
355146,we looked into the problem inside yearn and we got to that explanation of the issueassuming banteg knew already is just childish
355147,i dont think the concept of flashloans makes any sense here considering elrond works fundamentally different from ethereum
355148,i think there might be a misunderstanding here it seems to me that b4ds3ct0r was referring to the hacker and not banteg
355149,hacker suspected that something like this could happen and was already prepared for it
355150,dunno though
355151,yes thats what i meant thank you for clarifying
355152,sorry for the misunderstanding my bad
355153,hey guys a quick question for you i found a bunch of old walletdat but i have no idea about what blockchain theyre related to nor what i did with those back in the day rather than downloading bitcoin core litecoin core and all the core in the world is there a tool somewhere that could tell me which blockchain theyre from and the addresses privkeys in there theyre most likely empty as theyre from my student time but im curious still
355154,try to open walletdat with notepad and check its contents search for name string wallet address should be somewhere nearby
355155,wait walletdat isnt raw binary lol
355156,cant believe i never tried to inspect its contents
355157,thanks
355158,imagine the feeling getting hacked like this like you think youre playing this cool new game while in fact you were clicking metamask and sending eth and bayc away
355160,u really want us to click that link with that kind of title
355161,
355162,
355163,this is more a worry with web2 oauth portal logins
355164,this made me love physical dolar moar

355169,80mil per an revenue by 100mil toke supply pe 725 for all current stablecoin only
355170,need crypto pm
355171,my team and i were mapping a crypto analysts hierarchy of needs need inputs from folks here eg the bottom most can be access to data even though it needs to be scrubbed above that can be adapters and glue code to access data as platforms on demand in a consistent manner thoughts see sample attached
355172,not relevant for this chatbut ok to keep it herenice visualization btw
355173,its a framework to map lower order vs higher order needs
355174,
355175,this is the price for not using works with any erc20 token on any chain with simple approvetransferfrom logic we sent over 1m already i had very similar issue before with caffeinum but were lucky that gnosissafe had the same factory address on bnb as on mainnet also consulted one project of how to retrieve 100k investemts from different chain
355176,fed rate hike coming on june 15 expected rate increase by 50 bps cpi numbers for china and usa will be out on june 10brace for volatility and potential bearish sentiment this week coming up and days are very important trading leverage nowadays dont overexpose dont revenge trading and certainly do not destroy your capital reduce the amount your usually trade on and speculate
355177,wht if they dont raise rate and keep longs open
355178,unlikely no one knows for sure of course but fed has widely telegraphed another 50bps rate hike
355179,ecb meeting starts in 20minutes but decision is out rates stay at 050 but at the july meeting they will raise the rates
355180,they wont stop raising until the inflation slows down
355181,only if growth is still here
355182,means they will try to pump market for a while before fomc meeting and then dump it
355183,i think ecb and fomc corodinating mass damage
355184,not to raise rate together but one by one
355185,on top pick summer time and vacation in europe they want retailers to spend money

355189,
355190,asking for a friend support regarding etherscan verification deployed contracts with no metadata using paul berg templateunable to verify source code via etherscan like this anyone faced it thanks
355191,henlo frens chapter 2 of white rabbit is out you can watch the animation for free at public mints for producer passes starts in 2 hrs if you want to support also there may or may not be an airdrop in one of the options at the end
355192,beautiful thanks nice and ambiguous going to have to think about who to choose
355193,next level
355194,this could be considered safe but very centralized we need to adopt a stablecoin that doesnt have a single point of failurehow long should the cryptocurrency community be at the mercy of whoever controls the usdc treasury
355195,as long as us dollar is backed by department of defence
355196,lusd
355197,in theory why cant we make a stablecoin which is regulator compliant fully backed has blscklist and a wrapper for it which doesnt have blacklist isnt such scheme censorship resistant
355198,lets see if this is the airdrop one or psyops
355199,i think the blacklist is also a feature that makes it reg compliant
355200,yeah thats why you make usdf which has blacklist and wusdf which just locks usdf and doesnt have blacklist
355201,tldr making it reg compliant is orthogonal to censorship resistance as it has to inherit all the flaws of the dollar
355202,oh interesting what else erc 20 requires to be censorship resistant apart for blacklist
355203,im convinced that usdt tether do not audit their treasury publicly or share where their funds are held because its a huge security risk if usdt assets were held in a us bank account the us government can easily freeze or seize all of the usdt treasury whenever they want to making all of our onchain assets valuelessa lot of us in crypto first began using it because weve been screwed over by the bank in the past we shouldnt have to rely on them any longer
355204,is it bytecodehash none
355205,holly shit no one gives a fuck about tether fud
355206,next thing china is gonna ban mining
355207,this isnt 2017
355208,its not tether fud
355209,its a backed stablecoin security concern
355210,unless you can articulate through forensic accounting your points no one cares bro
355211,no one cares especially in a bear market atmosphere flight to quality means tether will be utilized the alternative is to stay in crypto and get rekt
355212,this is getting a bit magnum pi
355213,this is how retail gets dunked on by being afraid to use tether etc
355215,peter schiff has a gold ira you be perfect for amigo
355216,pax dollar does not depend on usdc
355217,there is gemini dollar
355218,there is rdai
355219,gusd went off peg to 160
355226,the smell of liquidation is the best
355227,should work eg uniswapv3 positions contract is bytecodehash none happy to have a look if youre having issues feel free to dm
355229,any fully onchain dao treasury management dapps
355230,could be done automatically once the last nft is minted too conditional in the mint func
355231,bro be careful saying dao management like that some web2 analyst will turn up with a term sheet
355232,a bit unfair to the last minter who would pay the extra gas but yeah
355233,gnosis sdoes most of whats needed are you trying to handle paycheque onchain assets
355234,this is true one could make last mint cheaper or some other hacky wizardry
355235,just checking if it exists
355236,bro this shit is so annoying like who tf are you to tell me what stablecoin i can use or not use if i want to use doge backed stable coin thats what i will do literally so ridiculous the most government can offer is seal of approval these mofos have no right gatekeeping stablecoin inovation
355237,if you want to play with the currency of the world police it stands to reason that you should follow their rules
355238,if you dont like it then the solution is theoretically simple dont use their currency or stop building humanmanaged fiatcoin wrappers
355239,buts its not even the federal government its the ny government
355240,if i was pegging to ny dollar theyd have some standing
355241,the ny dollar is the us dollar also the federal reserve bank of ny is the most influential on the markets
355242,none of that makes it ny states responsibility the dollar is backed by federal government not state government
355243,
355244,
355245,hes dunzo

355255,congrats on the floor app investment
355256,im a fellow investorholding a genesis token
355257,algo coins shoudlnt exist they are dumb dont work and hurt unknowing people its a toxic mess
355258,fin
355259,ok
355260,how do people create the text art they put at the top of smart contracts
355261,nan
355262,they 100 photoshopped him lmfaooooo
355263,they even photoshopped the laces
355264,nan
355265,who ties sneakers like that
355266,stay woke
355267,sam d donatoooor
355268,ah might be this one
355269,
355270,im in on because make the global forcrypto i want to biggest impact good
355271,let it be algos then
355272,thoughts on this
355273,amazing how bancor have successfully branded their pool2s and il protected
355274,what does bnt get exploited mean here
355275,bnt is bancors governance token which gets paired with every asset listed on bancorso if bnt declines against the assets its paired with then the lps suffer il
355276,yes im aware its their token im asking how you go about exploiting said token
355277,i think the author of this tweet meant their protocol gets exploited which leads to their token price crashing or if some malicious actor just dumps a massive amount of bnt initiating a death spiral nothing seems impossible in crypto anymore lol
355278,you can manipulate its price for an arb if a token has large pools across multiple dexes i guess though would expect them to have sufficient protections against it
355279,wouldnt the manipulation be going in the wrong direction if you drop the price of bnt then you should get less of the tokens paired against it in bancor youd need to artifically inflate the price of bnt and then use bnt on the cheap to swap out the other tokens no
355280,im not an expert at all may totally be missing something but it seems like the wrong direction for a death spiral
355281,if you could infinite mint bnt then you could theoretically drain all the liquidity since everything is paired with bnt big if though
355282,if you have your token xyz paired with bnt and then bnt drops relative to xyz youll have il on your xyz check out calculations here just drop the price of token b while keeping token a price the same
355283,
355284,sounds like llama pay but with a shite brand attached to it
355285,and there it is lol
355286,
355287,is there any other dex that has liquidity range other than uni v3
355288,orcas launched whirlpool concentrated liquidity functionality iirc
355289,the nft component sounds like they pulled some of the stuff weve built at revest but with a nonexistent ui
355290,i did a comparison a while back
355291,gonna wait for samczsun to ask them if theyre up
355292,feel like having all the capital provided up front for furo isnt the best design
355293,if anyone in here is with llamapay revest has fnftlinked smart wallets that would allow yall to pretty easily replicate the streamtransferability functionality without requiring any corecode changes to work
355294,hey im with llamapay
355295,well awesome will dm you
355296,whats great is that as you say its easy to build things on top like what you mentioned
355297,doesnt 3 contradict 4 in furo
355298,i agree having a start date in the future is good having a fixed duration is also good but only if you also have infinite duration
355300,yeah you can manually prolong them i think but in llama you dont need to do anything except periodically topping up the pot for all streams
355301,kyber has single sided liq didnt know they allowed concentrated liq too thought you just added to the pool
355303,hop claim live
355304,from my understanding the way it works is that you can create a stream for 2 months provide all the money needed for these 2 months and when it starts ending add more tokens for another 2 months and thus extend it so it requires periodic actions on each streamllamapay works by directly pulling money from a pool shared by all streams so you only need to top up when that runs low
355306,so like balancer lbps
355308,different tradeoffs furos system makes it very easy to add yield on top since all the money of a stream is fixed and going to a single person while on defillama the pooled nature of funds makes this much harder and we dont have that feature
355309,imo furo doesnt compare as favorably to others as sushi paints it i built an ape sdk for llamapay and the only big oofs i noticed were different units for depositwithdraw which are abstracted from you by sdkfrontend anyway and no feature to deposit on behalf of payer
355313,it requires a bit different building blocks we plan to provide them with yearn inferno some details can be found here
355315,p2e
355316,are you thinking of depositing some money on aave and you keep collateral but interest is streamed
355318,you could do that now but a big issue is that aave interest is not fixed but variable so stream speed would constantly change which would require txs
355321,its not p2e market issue but the whole crypto markets to fill ones fridge he will sell his ethbitcoin to fiat
355322,the vast majority of bnt is locked in in our amm north of 80 and most of it is actually owned by the bancor protocol itself this bnt is used to support trading liquidity for token side deposits the protocol itself never actively sells bnt and this means that there is very little bnt as compared to what the protocol owns in outside markets that can be used to drop the price of the bnt token
355325,i was just talking about the death spiral question was not insinuating that there was a scenario where this was likely
355327,that was live for a long time and was known either gib facts ser or this is kinda just vaporware
355329,ok now the usd dollar will fall and we should all stockpile wheat
355330,fair questions i think the sers can answer dma1086
355332,if the wallet i used to deposit into becon chain get compromised is there any safe way for me to change the withdrawal wallet or check if the attacker had bot set up to withdraw any incoming eth from the wallet
355334,
355335,how many gb of space does storing ethereum active addresses balance take on a node lets say only the eoas is it 5gb 10gb 25gb 100gb and why
355336,depends on client
355337,im not very sure but i dont think its particularly clear since balances are just part of state
355338,we have multiple levers that help us manage il risk at the protocol level tokens that are listed on bancor get different amounts of trading liquidity based on their risk profiles we can easily grow and shrink liquidity on our pools in order to control how much il we are exposing the protocol tobecause the protocol is providing trading liquidity then it is also earning fees on its portion of its stake all tokens on bancor are paired with bnt which means that half of all fees earned go towards the bnt side of the pool the protocol earns trading fee revenue on its bnt which it uses to cover il that is suffered by lps at withdrawal note that not all pools experience il and in fact there are many pools that are profitable and can be use to cover il experience in other poolsseparately we take 15 of swap fee revenue for our vortex burner which burns vbnt vbnt represents locked bnt in our protocol that supports trading liquidity and applies deflationary measures to the bnt token you can consider it an insurance premium for the il protection that we are providingin version 3 of our protocol we have a 25 security fee at withdrawal which we use to replenish pools that are in deficit on tokens essentially we use it to open up an arbitrage opportunity so that an outsider can supply us with tokens that are in deficit and therefore we can guarantee with a higher probability that you will receive your tokens plus fees at withdrawal in the token you deposited
355342,anyone seen this
355343,tbf did not know that just signing could do that
355344,any hardware wallet worth its salt wouldnt support something like that too
355345,to be clear there is no algo stablecoin that is backed by bnt we dont have one our version 21 of the protocol was released in november 2020 and has been proven through multiple adverse market conditions
355346,yea the thread also included that its only a mm issue and is known for quite some time just strange that it isnt disabled is all
355349,theyre kinda different though this is about ecdsa nonce reuse and that was about just metamask letting you sign transactions masqueraded as messages
355351,also related reuse of ecdsa nonces resulted in anyswap being drained last year
355353,interacting with a malicious contract will typically have minimal impact unless you own something like rune
355354,as for signing a transaction masquerading as a message that depends on what the transaction is
355355,your account wont necessarily be drained anyway its limited to what you can do in one tx
355356,other accounts derived from the same seed will also be unaffected
355357,as for ecdsa nonce reuse very unlikely that youll be unaffected by this since most wallets have a sane impl
355358,are there any good examples of cl price feed oracle aggegators out there that wont make me want to consider walking across broken glass as a serious alternative
355359,what do you mean by cl price feed aggregator
355360,a central contract i can hit with two addresses and ask for a price
355361,as it is if i wanted to get the price of eth in usdc that involves getting the price of usdc in eth and then dealing with all the funkiness involved with that
355362,to say nothing of 8 point decimal precision
355363,pretty sure you still need to do that math yourself but theres this registry
355364,still only limited to ethereum though
355365,thanks ethereum limit kills it for me
355366,just fyi akula is part of the new gitcoin qf round
355371,how do we feel about collabland and are there any alternatives that the community has seen
355372,1price
355374,there is a myriad of differences in exchange rates i dont think the conversation will be that simple
355375,sure i was just messing around
355377,if only life in web3 were that simple
355379,yo salut gs do someone know chats about currency traffic arbitragep2p
355381,not exactly great tbh often it just doesnt work on discord and we end up saying to people try again to connect your wallet in few hours but theres not a lot of good alternatives either
355382,is there a gitcoin grant for lobsterdao
355383,hmmm seems like basic need
355384,maybe we have our bear market project
355385,what if fake collabland and manually assign roles to ppl you like
355386,well thats basically whats happening right now with the real collabland right
355387,a zk collabland
355388,do we have this project
355389,i was curious about v3 and no il system isnt it primarily supported by trading fees you receive so low volume vs market down turn like weve seen this year create an issue seems like in a prolonged bear this can be an issue you stated launch in 2020 but vast majority of that time it was up only season lps would have gotten a ton of il since january if there was a bank run today would there be enough money to cover the il
355391,bntokens are also based and underrated for integration in various defi projects
355392,bored apes etc phone price of flagship 300k comes with free ape high end materials phone allows crypto in native apps in store solves clunky non native metamask web3 browser thats not geared to 3rd party apps 310 goes to token users save 20 of apple store model lower model buyers can care about savings can also support android store not my project but just curious on thoughtsnot saying its an easy target saying its the big vampire in the room
355393,so a phone
355394,yes that vampires cefi phones
355395,wtf is a cefi phone lmfao
355396,one thats closed to nft buying
355397,wrt to app store
355398,and all apps allowed to use crypto cut out apple pay harder to get mainstream crypto adoption without this
355399,if it goes well you could also sell laptops and desktops
355400,without a 300k phone
355401,thats just to make it a status symbol more than apple
355402,pretty sure metamask mobile on ios still has a built in browser
355403,ponzinomics
355404,vertu phones were supposed to be a status symbol but uh if you actually own one
355405,right but apple doesnt allow most apps to pay with crypto and web3 browser in metamask is clunky for 3rd party dapps compared to normal native apps
355406,can have various price points the bored apes one is an extreme example
355407,you know that you dont need to download apps from the app store
355408,yes but how many do it
355409,exactly
355411,right so at first small market for some flagship show off bored apes phone its 100x the status symbol of apple
355412,in all likelihood this bored ape phone you propose is just gonna be an android phone made by a chinese oem with a cringe theme
355413,but it doesnt have to be
355414,youre having a problem buying paintjpgs on your phone because app store and instead of either not using the app store or a phone without such a wallet garden the proposal is an entirely new phone that costs 300k with a narrative of fighting cefi phones
355415,then what would it be lol
355423,what was the name of the indian company that was going to release cellphonepoint of sale system
355424,idk that one many try many things but some eventually win with the right model etcanother problem solved is web3 dapps are clunky compared to native appsthe phone comes with an nft worth roughly the pay price so youre not paying 3300k for nothing and expensive nfts doesnt make it cefi or all of nfts would be cefi
355425,but they had big mc phone was size of 1986 cellphone ugh cant remember
355428,then your product is just an alternative app store of which there are a ton
355429,then we end up back at the chinese oem phone with custom branding thing again
355436,can use existing tech maybe some ui innovation most new models are just incremental improvement but use high quality components features
355437,heh if you dont realize those things are the least of your problems when trying to sell a new phone youre in for quite the surprise
355439,samsung had a phone with an cryptocurrency wallet preinstalled dont think there is any demand of that
355440,must be that if some fail all will pretty sure thats how social networks google etc tech history unfolded some failed and none made it forever founder energy here
355441,ya that wasnt the right model apparently
355443,nobody is saying its impossible to sell a crypto jpeger a 10m phone but if all you have going for it is has crypto payments then its dead definitively so
355444,yeah made big pr push no one cared
355445,999999 so youre saying the nft crypto app payments has 8k and growing user base very dedicated and pays exorbitant prices for things and uphold a multi trillion crypto market 8k sounds low but i guess your optimism makes sense long term
355446,especially when you consider that its already possible for people to make crypto payments buy nfts etc on their phone and they still get all the fancy apple ecosystem stuff
355447,oh apparently all samsung flagships come inbuilt with their blockchain wallet now
355449,unfortunately for that math fewer than 8b use a phone and even fewer a smartphone even fewer who might care about such a feature would be able to afford such a device and even fewer need to because of exactly what zhongfu has explained
355451,i think the main issue for such a thing will be the justification of it as a status symbol you can wrap a lambo in stickers of your favourite jpeg and it will still be as valuable as a lambo without that sticker because the average car market doesnt care about the status symbol of your jpeg
355452,re status symbol when was the last time you saw or heard of someone with a vertu phone
355453,but will you buy a lambo at a bit more if its a limited addition apelambo is a bad example because its already a status symbol where as phone isnt as much and adding a high price tag can make it one
355456,vertu is probably one of the more successful examples out there because theyre somehow still around after two decades
355457,nope if it doesnt have a resale value maybe one or two will buy but thats not how you create a market or a brand
355458,just saying that paying amount for something thatll become obsolete in less than 5 years doesnt make too much sense
355459,expensive watches sure because its not like theyll become useless but solid gold iphones
355460,caviar will like to have a word
355461,royal oak szn
355463,there are over 8k crypto holders there arent even up to 1k crypto holders that will buy a newfangled phone just so they can use a dead store to pay with cryptothe problem is not with the 999999
355464,i think solid gold iphones are a bit different than nfts with an nft based product the argument is that the brand value of nfts will give it the price not the inherent value of the material used
355474,the material used isnt the concern tbh a solid gold iphone is valuable because its an iphone thats wrapped in gold in many countries outside of the western ones iphone itself is the status symbol and wrapping in gold just enhances that wrapping a chinese oem in gold wont have the same value
355476,yeah and i have a birth certificate showing im bill gates grandson
355477,not really sure how much i will trust them to do software qa on a new phone if their discord gets hacked monthly
355487,see the issue is what the right player is if apple decided to release a 10k pfp series with apples having random size of bite marks and then came out with 10k phones that replaces the apple logo with one from the nft its associated with then it will most probably be a hit
355489,same cant be said about an nft native brand that doesnt have access to the same amount of infrastructure
355490,i described a working high end phone that can connect to android play store but also has an app store that allows native crypto and nft slick apps and comes with a branded tradable valuable nft eg bayc to justify a high price by which the phone can be high end what about that must be non functional
355491,no you havent youve described a fantasy the fact that you trivialize store management as such makes that incredibly obvious
355493,it might be worth your time to look at what any of fairphonepurismpinephone has gone through thinking dunking a piece of metal in liquefied diamond and shoving in the play store team of qa makes you a phone that will sell is straight up fantasy
355497,so no one in the world can ever compete with apple and android got it
355499,see this comment shows another problem you dont even understand what youre trying to offer is it a new phone brand a new os a new app store all 3 the last 2
355504,why mirror doesnt have any feed to read i am trying to find articles and crowdfundings live there but it just doesnt show anything only options for me to create own stuff
355505,try bressxyz
355506,i once built a dashboard for mirror nft and crowdfunds
355507,mirror isnt biggest web3 medium type platform it should show all existing crowdfunding on it otherwise why would someone open it why does it need bress
355508,nydfs has the privilege of being located in ny literally the only reason why its even relevant
355509,
355511,that i can get behind a web3 native app store and more importantly a plug and play approach for infrastructure to build and distribute crypto friendly apps
355512,1 experience with guild is flawless
355515,
355517,please dont send ideas like this here after the next mushroom trip
355518,ha but it ended at an apparently sensible marketplace idea that admins deleted but appreciated in this response
355519,no i am surprised zhongfu and coiner didnt just ban you right away
355520,stop it please i lost braincells
355521,thats a lot of words just to end up at lets clone fdroid lol
355523,guild 1010
355524,my question on this is how do aave liquidate leveragooor into a mad skewed stetheth liquiditity
355526,just to double check lens protocols indexer is not open source is it
355527,oh you mean the lack of liquidity in a liquidation i think there will be some equilibrium between the demand for steth and the discount on it the higher the discount the higher the demand this is a strong assumption since we remember the case of terra when it does not work bc of the bad design if we take as an assumption that the price of stetheth will return to 1 which should be true after the merge i think there will always be yield seekers who will buy steth at a reasonable discountanother option aave might even keep some bad debt in the worst case scenario and wait until the price comes back
355528,slightly related to your question i just read this thread apart from the doom and gloom one thing got glued to my brain if the stetheth peg collapses there will be lots of cheap future eth 20 available to be bought with eth which to me looks like a positive thing also im genuinely curious how aave liquidations will affect the rest of the defi ecosystem
355529,yeah so i think this is completely unrelated to terra but given the a factor of the main curve pool it could really wick hard if all liquidators ape into it at roughly the same time at a given level i think 08 from parsec people will step in sure but probably afterwards this leaves leveragoor perma rekt cause they will be liqued at horrible levels
355530,yeah read that thank you its good overview other queston is waht is actual eta of redemption obc not at the merge it needs another eth upgrade i read 69m from now till redemption possible that reasonable any views
355533,i find it a bit awkward that it was suggested by twitter as a topic of interest in the cryptocurrencies category this way the reach is massive sending fud shockwaves through the audience contributing to the acceleration of the depeg
355534,why awkward bankruns happen via social catalysis among ppl twitter is a social catalyser for conversations its doing what it is supposed to do show you what everyone is wanting to hear about
355535,social platforms dont think what they are contributing in they serve you info that is most likely to be engsged with and thats about it
355537,
355538,
355539,steth depeg dashboard is top 2 by popularity
355540,anyone know where i can check liquidation prices for steth on aave
355541,parsecfinance
355542,need an account though
355543,nan
355544,parsec access fur lobsters
355545,pls gib small discount

355551,lol just crypto frens would do these
355553,anyone got yvsteth liquidation level on abra from parsec im only on pleb unpaid version
355554,
355555,read somewhere that he cant dump because there is no liquidity anywhere duh so the game theory optimal move here is to return the 18 m
355556,but the meme potential
355557,yeah lets get a 10k generative art out of this
355558,
355559,woohooo now what
355560,cpi expected 83actual cpi yoy 86not good
355561,heybanteg may i ask whats the link for the article
355562,btw i tried to create a stream but when i clicked nothin happened
355563,meh i would say that real cpi is 20 but the quality of goods is worsened so it got fixed to 86
355564,this dashboard keeps improving
355565,you mean cpi energy and food inflation i presume
355566,welll
355567,if not having energy food and housing
355568,whats in that cpi anyway
355569,cpi doesnt include those two hence my comment its a bs metric
355570,has always been
355571,consumers consume food energy and housing
355572,everything else is less relevant
355573,im not debating that cpi is a misleading metric by design important to be aware of it
355574,i know one can make a cpi contained of nfts like cryptopunks and it will be really good
355575,yeah
355576,can you raise crv rewards apy to reflect the growing inflation
355577,only by voting to increase crv in one place at the expense of another
355578,the food index increased 12 percent in may following a 09percent increase the prior month theindex for food at home rose 14 percent in may the fifth consecutive increase of at least 10percent all six major grocery store food group indexes rose in may the index for dairy andrelated products rose 29 percent its largest monthly increase since july 2007 the index fornonalcoholic beverages increased 17 percent and the index for other food at home rose 16percent the cereals and bakery products index increased 15 percent in may after rising 11 percent inapril the index for meats poultry fish and eggs rose 11 percent over the month with theindex for eggs rising 50 percent the index for fruits and vegetables rose 06 percent in mayafter declining in april the food away from home index rose 07 percent in may after rising 06 percent in april theindex for full service meals rose 08 percent over the month the index for limited service mealsincreased 07 percent in may after rising 03 percent in april the food at home index rose 119 percent over the last 12 months the largest 12month increasesince the period ending april 1979 all six major grocery store food group indexes increased overthe span with five of the six rising more than 10 percent the index for meats poultry fishand eggs increased the most rising 142 percent with the index for eggs increasing 322 percentthe remaining groups saw increases ranging from 82 percent fruits and vegetables to 126percent other food at home the index for food away from home rose 74 percent over the last year the largest 12monthchange since the period ending november 1981 the index for full service meals rose 90 percentover the last 12 months and the index for limited service meals rose 73 percent over the lastyear the index for food at employee sites and schools fell 305 percent over the last 12 monthsreflecting widespread free lunch programs
355579,you have iristo from martti malmi
355581,core cpi is 6 and down from april core is fundamentally what matters re policy decisions
355582,that doesnt change the fact the the user needs to get back an actual asset though
355583,and if so the liquidator then actually has to act as a trader
355584,while luquidators usually dont and get rid of positions instantly as they are arbitragers in nature
355585,no
355586,
355587,also the same is true pretty much everywhere its not euler specific at all
355588,korpi87 reply above ser good thread btw
355589,its not true on compound im pretty sure and therefore not true on most lending protocols
355590,ah oke thanks for correcting me anyway aave has it as major liquidity source 2b
355591,if the user has 50 of their position liquidated they just lose 50 of their collateral and 50 of their debt they dont need to get back an actual asset the liquidator on euler takes on board both the debt and the collateral this is epecially useful if they think the collateral is under valued as in the steth case or the debt is overvalued as in the case of a short squeeze
355592,i mean that the depositors lp side need to have the same asset they threw in so whats different sorry i am being slow
355593,the way i understand it is that a liquidator can decide to prefund a liquidation essentially and take steth on their balance sheet well they can just marketbuy
355594,excellent thread
355595,no they dont need the same asset they threw in they just need collateral it could be usdc or whatever
355596,the liquidators account is just like any other lending and borrowing account
355597,wait wdym if i deposit usdc to euler i want usdc back
355598,u cant just decide to give me eth back when i threw in usdc
355599,youre still thinking the loan is being repaid its not the liquidator is just taking over the loan
355600,liquidator deposits 1000 usdc
355601,ah okok got it thanks for correcting mebut then again the liquidator can just market buy an asset they consider to be undervalued
355602,on aave you can also take the whole debtcollateral position of the account under liquidation this
355603,it boils down to the strategy of the liquidator
355604,yup i was just wondering whats unique here per se ofc its cool that it is there but a liquidator in my small brain is assumed to be an arbitrageur you cantshouldnt expect them to take on balance sheet risks and deciding what asset is good or not to hold they usually get rid of all within a minute
355605,yep it seems the same as the euler strategy
355606,yes i think same technicalities apart
355607,well i think this wethsteth case is probably more than worth it for some liquidators to take the risk
355608,liquidators doing this have to swap during adverse liquidity conditions that means slippage high gas fees exchange costs often much more preferable to just take the debt and wait for mean reversion definitely some market risk but more often than not worth it
355609,thx chads
355610,can i gib u both a lobster blz gib ur ens to send to if you dont have any yet

355631,
355632,gonna smell like no deoderant and cheetos dust
355633,completely agree with strategy as a riskoff person i usually avoid putting large sums in anything new theres no better security audit than being battle tested in the wild unfortunately so it takes time to build that level of trust we have a small gauntletstyle risk team inhouse at the rd company that will start producing reports soon they do a lof of offchain simulation research params and other risk metrics in the docs any suggestions for improvements welcomed

355647,
355648,
355649,oh
355650,
355651,doesnt that make ldo borderline useless
355652,in the comments cobie says is oke cause ldo is supposed to capture fees and not tamper w eth network itself
355653,that seems ill thought imo
355654,and the designation of principal and agent here seems backwards great for eth bagholders though
355655,no more excuses to not run an archive ok its testnet but for learning purposes
355656,this doesnt make any sense to me the reason most people are even bothering with lido rather than randomprojectt1000 no one has heard about is because of its very real influence
355657,i assume this and the limiting staked eth discussions with vitalik literally spanking lido has led to this but even those are likely proactive things it seems fine to me
355659,this is proper pr ser cobie is smart
355660,these proposals are effectively begging dare i say quite slyly for lido to willingly make themselves easy and unproblematic to kill

355685,hi all trying to replicate some of the numbers for the total projected yield apy calculation on ribbon finance has anyone tried to do this not able to achieve their numbers getting higher numbers for some reason im using the formulas for performance and yield provided from the website thanks in advance
355686,this is not yield no dovs are yield if trading in one direction goes too far you are losing
355687,very cool thank you ser noob question if you dont mind lets say i want to do some chain analysis iterating through contract deployments and extracting cfgs if i wrote code to do this on ropstein using erigon then wanted to scale up to a mainnet archive using geth would i have to rewrite a lot of code
355688,im not sure how exactly erigon works just worried that i would have to start from scratch if i wanted to scale up
355689,mainnet disk requirements are much bigger
355690,hm so does this mean the apy number shown on ribbon is a misstatement is there a projected profit that can be calculated based on the covered call strategy
355691,thats fine more concerned about dev time and code reuse
355692,the apy is projected based on premium collected in the last 4 weeks and assuming options will expire out of the money if the options expire itm then you dont see the loss on the apy but you can only see that on the historical chart how that performed
355693,gotcha that makes sense sorry for potentially stupid question but is the option premium based on certain parameters volatalityperceived risk or does ribbon charge a preset percentage 1 2 wasnt able to verify this myself does the premium have something to do with auction price i found this for eth covered calls and not sure if it helps at all
355694,options strike price has a set distance of 10 from pricepremium is determined by auctioning off the options
355695,usually option pricing is calculated using black scholes and its a function of certain parameters ie expiry strike price spot price risk free rate and implied volatility which is an estimation of how volatile will be in the case of ribbon and other dovs the trade is actually made trough an auction and thats the premium collected
355696,really appreciate the detailed explanations let me try this out
355697,it do sound like that but to be fair the altl1 dont really have amazing arguments that would try them very muchbut theyre certainly applying a level of skepticism to altl1 that they dont apply at all to projects they interview talk about in general
355698,
355699,curve says this is not true is there a reliable source for comparable volumes between the two platforms
355700,thx 4 sharing
355701,thx these docs are quite well written refreshingly different from gitbook copypasta lots of thoughtful considerations in the design
355702,how many validators can exit per day once the unlock happens how many eth can be unlocked daily
355703,this is still undetermined but id love to hear from others i have heard that the withdrawal queue as currently designed will last for many months more than 3
355704,and that was based on modeling done just projecting from validator key rotation needs
355705,3 is the conservative number i remember but ive heard 6 months or 1yr thrown around casually
355706,3 as in validator so 96 eth a day
355707,i think its possible devs from staker side or client teamsef achieve a respec
355708,no i dont know the number of eth
355709,but like the queue will be full perpetually for many months in normal conditions as currently designed meaning new withdrawals have to wait at least that long as a cooldown period unless a redesign occurs which might happen we wont know in public until they start discussing it after the merge
355710,if you find out the plz share here its around in various docsforums i just dont remember it and dont want to be misquoting
355711,what does this mean for the timing of the merge
355712,very little as this time they may get in on schedule may not as always
355713,haha i think i dm you in the lido chat but accidentally got banned i sent a source that i think answers your question
355714,source was redditeth consensus specs
355715,900 validators a day from memory exit queue and entry queue numbers same
355716,yeah that is correct
355717,dont know what a cfg is but i guess you want to extract info from deployments it depends on how your are going to make it if using standard interfaces it might work if reading directly from erigon db definitely not different clients use different db formatssolutions
355718,both lido devs and coredev are working on various ways to reduce the queue the former different schemes to obviate the need for regular key rotation
355719,and latter ways to make the queue larger without sacrificing security economic guarantees
355720,thats the minimum it goes up or down to the minimum based on of active validators
355721,
355722,so i didnt remember the exact number but just extrapolating from existing staker key rotation needs that queue could be full for quite awhile after withdrawals enabled
355723,its at over 1k rightnow dont remember exact number
355724,nice thx was looking for something like this
355725,partial withdrawals will likely alleviate stress on the exit queue as well
355726,this version of them is included in capella planned hardfork that will enable withdrawals
355727,sorry control flow graphs heres an example id like to filter by deployments then extract the contract bytecode and block number if erigon db allows you to do that then it shouldnt be an issue
355728,did u rebrand khanhamzah
355729,boolish
355730,wen 2022 so far
355731,nan
355732,have u watched sono bisque doll wa koi wo suru ivan
355733,im almost sure this info is very easy to extract directly from erigon db ie can be easily read from state but i recommend you to ask in their discord
355734,also erigon mainnet alpha takes 15tb
355735,recommend ser
355736,much smaller system requirements than geth for your usecase
355737,yes its a very good watch
355738,thanks will check
355739,does anyone know fwb multisig w the cash innit
355740,or where did their huge raise go
355741,parties
355742,they raised from a16z a bunch since its a dao or is it not it must be sitting in a multisig
355743,info from girlfriend
355744,nah andy on twitter shilling and i wanted to check how much cash they have left
355745,
355746,understood
355747,nvm wrong one
355748,
355749,seems like is this
355750,seems a diff wallet it was only topped up with 450k usdc
355751,
355752,ye this
355753,
355754,nice ill start with erigonropstein thanks again
355755,apologies for the long reply just thought id address some usual questions with a bunch of ways the bancor 3 protocol has to mitigate il minting bnt isnt the only way to pay for impermanent loss pools accrue fees and can be net positive or negative the il cost is socialised throughout the protocol meaning that the cost of il isnt significant il is also a very individual problem on xyk pools where an lp might be underwater while another one is positive these differences are balanced for everyones benefit there is a 025 withdrawal fee that is used to open an arbitrage opportunity whenever possible which aims to rebalance the bnt and token in each pool this mechanism helps distribute the cost of il throughout the whole protocol as well if a bank run starts happening on bancor the spot price and ema of the pools will differ by more than the minimum requirements 1 when this happens withdrawals are halted until the price stabilises there is a 7day cooldown period that allows the dao to implement actions to mitigate any form of bankrun should it see one happening bnt is a very liquid token on bancor lps getting back some of their stake in bnt and selling it for a token wont significantly impact the spot price of bnt on bancor also a lot of the bnt on bancor is owned by the protocol roughly 60 the bancor protocol uses 15 of the trading fees to atomically buy vbnt on each swap and burn it later this mechanism locks bnt forever in the protocol and supports bnts value the whitelisting process involves going through an internal audit process where the token contract is checked against the bancordao token requirements some of these requirements involve having a fair distribution of the token to avoid price manipulation no contract pausability no upgradeability no possibility to freeze transfers etc when a pool is created it goes into a bootstrapping phase the dao msig approves an initial price and bnt funding usually 10k 20k bnt additional bnt funding is increased by 2x and happens on new deposits when the spot price and ema dont differ by more than 1 this makes the pools liquidity ramp up slowly in case there is high volatility of the token vs bnt and distributes the token price vs bnt the bancordao can increase or decrease the funding limit of the vaults as part of the liquidity is trading and part is nontrading this means that the bancordao can now assess the risk involved with each token and choose a unique funding limit as well as pool fee if the pools go below the minimum funding limit theyre disabled until the dao msig approves them again there is a mechanism to guarantee lps get their stakes back even if the pool isnt funded anymore
355757,yes partials will help some but as i understand it the biggest source of withdrawal demand will be all of the existing locked stakers with need to do key rotation not for yield optimization reasons but security reasons so my guess is the queue is full for awhile
355758,for withdrawal creds theres going to be a 1time event to rotate bls keys to 0x01 as a part of capella relevant pr
355759,
355760,hey guys has anyone here got access to messari enterprise wanted to access an article unfortunately i only have messari pro would really appreciate the help thanks
355761,oh wow this is neat its kinda like a rolling limit calculated each epoch
355762,reminiscent of the sushi feesbridge bug
355763,it also grows with the network so while it was 4 to start with its actually moved to 5 already
355764,nice i wish there was a dashboard that showed this info are you seeing this by querying your own nodes
355765,beaconchain has some of this you can do math to figure out the real value
355766,a 2tb ssd can be had for a pretty reasonable price these days fortunately
355767,buying a house as a first time home owner has less steps than this
355768,hm five or even ten chats per folder seems like a nerf
355769,anyone looked at web5 closely its impossible to understand
355770,they have link to a document with literally 180 sample jsons is this an elaborate prank
355771,wait web5 is not a meme
355772,damn it is not i am afraid to ask but what happened to web3
355775,anchor protocol lmao
355776,telegram founders have been funding telegram their pocket didnt know founders are billionaire
355777,durov founded russian facebook vkcom didnt he
355778,his billions are mostly based on a 4050 billino valuation for telegram
355780,
355781,this is the official presentation from block
355782,i like how they skipped 4 and went straight to 5
355783,the ol samsung trick
355784,web2web3web23web5
355785,omg didnt know devs are russian
355786,really
355787,just skimming it is there any difference from using a zero knowledge identity solution like iden3
355788,with http as your application layer
355789,some ssi stuff is based on zk evernym at least was until it went bankrupt digital idssi seems like a fastlane to bankruptcy
355790,so probably no real difference except that didverifiedcreds pretends to be a standard
355791,bullish
355792,isnt it too early for web5 web3 need more time to evolve at its best if jack wasnt involved it looked just a joke
355793,web69 more suitable
355794,just now lol
355796,lol you posted 2 minutes earlier than elon
355797,you secretly elon
355798,created by jack
355799,is acceptably nondystopian selfsovereign identity even possiblearticle comments
355800,can i ask how much frax supply are team holding
355801,no this the work of his tbd team daniel is the didverified credentials guy i think jack just funds this i dont think he had any real input in some ways this seems to be somewhat similar to urbit
355802,i also have the same question to be precise how much the protocol is held
355803,does anyone have an idea for long tail assets lendingborrowing platforms
355804,does it help100
355805,tangential conversation anybody living in thailand that knows if the smart visa can be used for crypto digital nomads
355806,100 of what
355807,bot attacks
355808,for now it uses a visual captcha and while it successfully stops bots it wont stop spammers who are joining manually with multiple accounts i will have a possible solution for that in the next release too

355812,help blz
355813,wdym
355814,you can check here everything related to 0x
355815,right now and for the past 15 year most trades are just relayed via 0x but executed throughout amms
355816,probably the most volume coming from mms are from limit orders which you have the data to differentiate but again they just execute the arbitrage between limit order amm
355818,usdc does not have any risky corporate bonds composition do they in contrast does usdt have those
355819,yep
355820,they do around 5 and usdt a bit less but the most annoying are not corporate bonds but the secured loans funds and others assets including crypto
355822,fractional reserve is a much bigger and more profitable business
355823,paxos usdpbusdhusd does i guess
355824,there is this retarded concept of negative interest rates there is also another concept of paying salaries to people which are generally not possible to cover from these fees esp when dealing with mountains of regulator imposed paperwork and legaleze
355825,just holding massive amounts of fiat for others is incredibly expensive at scale
355827,usa should do a lot of things they are not a very reasonable people
355828,still a part of deposits can be modeled as stable liquidity for the bankissuer they can investtransform them liquidity andor rate transformation there is strict ratio and strict surveillance for banks circle or tether are not considered as banks for now so they can invest their deposits as they want and without being full transparent
355829,paxos does yes
355830,
355831,vance yet again showing lack of understanding of wtf he is tweeting about
355832,
355833,this
355834,yeah yet another vc influencoooor
355836,vance and framework are kinda ethfriendlyfans but comparing the 2 assets shows ignorance maybe he is stressed cause his coins r worth 0
355837,means all goes well
355838,thanks for the response
355839,what does trustwallet mean when it says replacement transaction underpriced what do i need to change in order to cancel a tx
355840,im putting more gas than the pending tx not sure why i cant do it
355841,you need to either send a tx with the same nonce and higher gwei
355842,or send a transaction your own wallet with 0 eth and the same nonce and higher gwei
355843,thats what im doing but its still saying underpriced
355844,even if i put the numbers way higher i get same error
355845,with the same nonce
355846,yea same nonce watever tx went thru after 1hr but still wierd i couldnt cancel
355847,any good reads on state and storage on ethereum
355848,heding steth without eth exposure on euler
355850,haha what
355852,soon integrating euler ser
355853,wtf that is how market works
355854,its worst not to price in risk
355855,
355857,i am talking about the blockchain not solidity
355858,no thats not how it works i was calling out the risks of leveraged staking a long time ago i always said there should be a countertrade option otherwise you get unsustainable bubbles which always get popped youre blaming the wrong person if you think this is bad blame the people that encouraged leveraged staking as low risk high reward blame the people that disabled steth shorting to encourage the bubble
355859,it explain how data of smart contracts is stored in the blockchain low level
355861,state doesnt have to be that of smart contracts
355862,and it doesnt explain how eth clients store state
355863,yes agreed we do move slowly i think thats a feature not a bug btw
355866,trading is zerosum there is no such thing as great timing whats good for one person is bad for another and vice versa
355868,i meant moving slowly and carefully is a feature not a bug ie the team doesnt ape into the latest high yield trend
355870,they have treasury bonds too not just cash but better than usdc and usdt for sure
355871,paxos claims otherwise i think secedit my bad tbills too
355872,hi this might be interesting to you
355873,what do you mean the timing the strategy has been there for over a month for anyone to use
355876,i doubt it the thai website has a list of targeted industries and it doesnt include blockchaincrypto it has digital but that seems to be more about internet of things etc so probably wont qualify for a startup smart visa but who knows maybe worth applying and taking a chance
355877,around that time yes it was years of work to get euler into full operation though so hardly like we timed it certainly not dancing on graves i just think markets should be free and fair healthy markets need long and shorts banning shorting always leads to worse outcomes the market always finds a way whats happening now is because there hasnt been a fair market
355878,well tbh a market where there is no dancing on graves wont be an efficient market and will at some point just lead to mass graveyards
355880,if you are just accelerating it then it would have collapsed anyway
355881,such a basic take omfg
355883,lets not trade so no one loses money then mr
355885,if it cant survive this maybe the mechanism was not ready we should not be careful not to break stuff we should stress test everything to the worst scenarios
355886,if euler doesnt do it a centralized platform will where there is profit someone will capitalize it
355889,whole idea of creating defi is having anti fragile systems
355894,because you can do it thats it because people got over leveraged
355895,and the ones over leveraged might get liquidated
355896,making space for less risky players
355899,what irrational expectance
355900,not built but the over leveraged people had other expectations
355901,people decide on their risk and their investments
355904,but the people who bought in because someone shilled
355905,should get rekt
355906,that is how you mature a market
355907,well that is how a market matures id guess
355908,no real data points in my statement
355910,no system or way of building something can fix people buying because of shills and thats not a bad thing lol
355913,sir just propose a solution we are waiting
355914,nice tinfoil hat
355915,fits you well
355918,not shilling any side of the trade just saying its not eulers fault mate
355919,isnt that how institutionsmoney players behave in any other market isnt all markets about manipulation at least in risk assets
355922,isnt all market about manipulation
355923,no
355924,seems that we have basic differences on what we are building for
355927,we as you and me
355928,i dont think alejo is talking about ethosideals just how markets work
355929,who are these normal people
355930,i will be pretty surprised if theres actually any amount of retail in steth besides defi degens who always knew the risk but chose to ignore it because only up
355932,does anyone know if using a multisig to bridge with multichain has any issues
355934,you think willful ignorance entitles them to riskfree profitmaking endeavors
355936,yes
355938,im not the one trying to shirk personal responsibility
355939,isnt that a celsius problem tho celsius taking risks with client fund is celsius responsibility not the markets
355941,how is market functioning like a market is a bad effect
355943,by that logic all sellers should be blacklisted so its only up
355945,whats the manipulation tho its not like the whale wallets of steth were hidden from public
355947,retail volume is not nearly enough
355948,why would any retail look to buy with this market trend
355949,its been manipulated at tops and bottoms since the beginning retail will only come in when theres some uptrend
355951,imo crypto markets are kinda a sham at this point direction decided entirely by insiders with retail only there to accelerate we trend
355952,
355953,when normal people and retail profit my profitwhen they get rekt now now lets have a nuanced discussion about who is responsible for my losses after i deposited my money in thing
355954,lmao
355956,you sure do fancy appearances methinksmaybe stop putting money in things that can be rekt after being attacked for profit
355958,you dont see soros in jail after what he did to the pound
355960,yeah im sure those people are thinking of others when in profit
355962,and for you its about having nuanced discussions on who to blame when your profitmaking attempt goes splat
355964,i too like strawmen
355966,im in it for the technolog szn is here
355968,on the topic of generating profits has anyone used this yet
355969,true
355970,you need to work on your yoga stretches if you think i hold steth or use leverage youre gonna break your back with that form
355971,where do i sign up if i am in it for the money
355973,here
355974,i actually have one kek gotta find the wallet
355975,ok fin take to dms
355976,wen private grp
355977,selling lobster dao paid group as nfts is how we make it all back
355978,it alreadye xists
355980,ser pls invite me i need make back from luna
355985,fine ill moderate
355986,get the ugly nft pinned message link
355987,nan
355988,i thought lobsters would like this idk
355989,are there any sources that show how much a miner earned in priority tx fees per block
355990,etherscan shows burnt gas fees but not how much was earned in priority
355991,2 1405656141591472817 13145081184641833
355992,i can see that fees burned were 13145081184641833 ether based on an avg of 43 gwei fee so if one assumes priority fees all defaulted to 1 gwei would it be safe to assume that the priority fees earned are 13145 eth 43 so 003 eth
355993,2 block reward14056 tx fees including base and tip13145 basefees
355994,or you can take the total miner reward and subtract the block reward same thing
355995,oh i see the block reward line
355996,so 009 priority fee thanks
355997,i was curious just about priority fee because block reward will go away post merge but priority fees will continue and just be distributed to the validator assigned to that block
355998,to be specific it goes to the fee recipient not necessarily to the validator
355999,attestation and proposal rewards get added to the validator balance priority fee goes to the fee recipient address
356000,true though id imagine most validators will be greedy in that regard lol
356001,yes precisely which makes running something like rocketpool a bit more attractive post merge as the node operator would earn all the priority fees
356002,only if and when you get to propose a block i guess lol
356003,so by running 2 rpl nodes instead of 1 solo one would earn 2x the priority fees though those would be rare and not be too much they could add up over time
356004,right currently i get about 1 block ever 4 or 5 weeks
356005,so if i get 009 per 5 weeks thats not too shabby
356006,if i get 018 every 5 weeks thats even better
356008,yeah not too shabby actually thats like an extra 59 apr
356009,also rocketpool team is considering lowering the barrier of entry from 50 of node supply 16 eth to perhaps 25 or 8 eth plus 10 equivalent of rpl so now one would go from 1 solo to 4 rpl nodes
356010,and now its up from 009 to 036 eth
356011,this is back of the napkin math
356012,but all in all it makes it seem on the surface anyway very attractive
356013,there is the additional risk of rocketpool contract attack surface as opposed to solo but by the time merge happens they will have been fairly well battle tested though if there were any major vulnerabilities those likely wouldnt be seen until withdrawals were enabled
356014,
356015,so theyre planning ways to force the node operators into setting a fee recipient to rpl for that fee to be distributed fairlyso it still a consideration since youd earn at least as much fees on avg by running rpl node as opposed to solo if you have 2 nodes at 50 then you still get 50 of 2x fees so 100 plus a of the other 50 and one of the solutions would redistribute those fees straight back to your withdrawal addressnot as attractive but still something i will be considering
356016,damn im super ngmi
356017,
356022,
356023,cool stats overall
356024,teddywoodward ser so what are the risks here that i am taking on1 cant be liquidated since i am just lending2 if anyone else is liquidated i must hope that it is done on time and the asset composition now is just major assets right3 no slippage at entry4 nothing else to know of some curve changes norepayments or some seniority occuring before a lender can take out
356025,always contract vulnerability risks and potential opportunity costs
356026,yup those are ofc are always a vague given so didnt feel the need to reask them
356027,
356029,whats this honeypot
356031,on a new chain with tvl of 100k
356032,please give concrete info and not larp ser
356033,meneedyields blz
356034,does direction matter if not i have
356035,yes ofc i just dont understand what mrkwhg was trying to say
356037,next time ban for such larp shittery
356038,especially considering your above streak
356039,you probably looked at either a new masterchef shitcoin pool 2 apr of the first day or a new chain with 100k usd tvl total
356040,both are bleh so either throw it in or sayonara
356042,with increase lt for steth to 90 theyre not pushing celsius to unwind position and making steth depeg bigger risk factor
356043,they want to have steth holders draw out more eth and support the peg this way which makes more for aave then
356044,aave we have an a parameter too hm interesting tho wouldnt expect such a move
356045,thats why i am poor and they r not
356046,pause eth borrowing if lt is changed then preventing existing positions from increasing their risk exposure is required to do this you would need to prevent new eth borrows from being opened almost all eth borrowing is recursive borrowing and so while there is limited demand for eth borrow its still something users want
356047,that doesnt really help indeed just makes the situation worse
356048,the protocol wouldnt be able then to unwind anyway since its not a forced measure so whats the use of that
356049,it will help our modern robin hood to settle better for sure for them otc deal with celsius
356051,that meme was ok for kingdom 3
356052,lol all this ftx hate is unfounded imo blame should be on poorly managed ust risk it should be celsius this deflection makes no sense
356053,seems like they are hoping that the depeg wont fall further than 20 as they said its more of a breathing room than anything else the unwind happens way quicker when the threshold is reached
356054,while i do agree that celsius behavior is egregious we musnt forget that they are playing with user funds liqing celsius hurts the general population more than bad celsius management same story with the whole ustluna unwind do kwon is still filthy rich probably
356055,lol i cant believe we have people here bootlicking celsius dude is acting like they are some non profit organization that needs to be saved people make mistakes accept the consequences of poor risk management and acting like its risk free nobody owes you anything for seeing that your uponly mechanics were wrong and providing tools that help bring the systemic risk back to equilibrium
356056,i think it is beautiful to see defi wear itself out like this whether it is terra celcius ftx or whoever doing it all these events are nature healing itself we need more exploits and lawsuits to perfect the space
356057,none of the 3 entities youve mentioned should be called defi
356058,lawsuits to perfect the spacelol
356059,yes ftx and celsius are clearly not decentralized
356060,you wanna create a world ecosystem of finance on back of people who are literally screened for risk taking behavior inherently then all this is inevitable this space will make mistakes some people will learn from it and hopefully help others from not repeating those mistakes how world works you literally cannot have linear growth when undertaking such systemic changes
356061,do we protect people or do we let em do whatever we want full freedom implies no protection usuallyvswe have to protect and selfpolice because otherwise regs will fuck us lets try to radiate virtue
356062,been there done that we all know the arguments lets please not engage in mental masturbation
356063,yeah still just the two risks smart contract risk and economic risk if positions dont get liquidated in time then there could be some protocol insolvency but we use conservative assets and risk parameters there is a decent reserve buffer the final thing is that if you lend at the one year there will be a period of three months when you wont be able to exit between the june maturity roll and the sep maturity roll you wont be able to take your cash out
356064,what was your conclusion
356065,its obvious ser
356066,when your bag go up embrace yolowhen bag go down call gary gensler
356067,we are all like that whether we like to say that or not but anyway personal choice i believe full freedom is better cause protection always goes wrong
356068,btw whats the rationale for not letting me take out principal and all still stays why that barrier just curiousand second if i take out before it means i sell position on the open market w slippage entailed and not actually just withdraw wo slippage
356069,first yeah basically we only maintain liquid 3 month 6 month and one year markets so we skip the 9 month to avoid fracturing liquidity too much so when you cant take it out its because youre falling in that 9 month gap it becomes tradable again after the next quarterly rollsecond yes youre correct you are trading with slippage not just withdrawing
356070,is there a new 1yr market ser
356071,yup a new one opens up automatically on each roll the next one will be june 2023
356072,wait wdym what if i want to lend now into a yearly one ui doesnt show it
356073,
356074,fresh off the press mostly all obvious stuff but good to scroll
356075,yeah if you want to lend now you can lend to june 22 sep 22 or mar 23 if you wait until the june maturity in a few weeks you will then be able to lend to sep 22 dec 22 jun 23
356076,who remembers that 3 years ago or so makerdao cofounder nikai mushegian donated 3200 mkr on chain to his alma matter carnegie mellon university
356077,i remember that
356078,wondering what happened anyone willing to explore past transactions the amount was exact it should be easy to find and track
356080,
356081,held on this wallet now
356082,
356083,anyone has tried euler why i cant borrow steth as i have deposited usdc
356084,it showcollateral violation please check that you have deposited sufficient collateral into the accounts involved in this transaction to support your operations
356086,not sure if joking or serious
356088,hello support here you may be trying to borrow too much steth drop into our discord and i will help you figure it out currently in the queue for a binance thing at consensus so time on my hands for a little while
356089,whats the best way to identify ponzis like leveraged staking of borrowed eth for steth feels like there was a good amount of money to be made on it during the bullrun
356090,how is leveraged steth farming a ponzi
356092,is celsius unloading or anything else in particular that caused the candles or is it just regular bear stuff
356093,rumor is celsius sold steth at discount to alameda
356094,thus alameda hedging aggro with eth perps
356095,shown in oi increase
356096,hi guys where i can check total eth liquidation value in maker
356097,
356098,lmfao
356099,ok the only good thing is that they are ditching the dapp terminology for dwa
356100,
356101,why is that a good thing dapps are easy to pronunce dwaps sounds bad
356102,try ledu you wont regret
356104,jai is good at story telling but he and the other rari cofounders legit fucked tribe by leaving right after the merger
356105,tt added them recently another way to look at the data
356106,what are the core protocols in defi or in general crypto that exists in tradition finance as welllike lending borrowing and staking other protocols like farming doesnt exist in traditional finance right
356107,they do kinda roboadvisorsbut not 11 given that platforms dont give farmable rewards and its all siloed
356108,better to leave than to stay and sabotage
356109,seems parallel discord hacked
356110,yes indeed
356111,i dont think we are all like thatthere are quite a few who understand riskreward rule of nature
356112,
356113,tokens are bad after they set me for life ofc lol and this immutability fetish seems to be a new trend started by andre after he got set for life too next thing jai will work on defi regulation
356114,andre had his reasons he was burned hard jay wasnt in the market for long enough imho i dont know him and i liked his story he wrote but seems like weak
356115,yes indeed its the usual trajectory1 embrace freedom and gamble into safe financial future11 if failed start hating freedom embrace regulation so people wont take your money anymore12 if succeeded peace out and become happy13 if succeeded peace out and embrace regulation so nobody takes your money
356116,i always respect a fellow watchmen
356117,yeah andre probably needed a breal but jais story is a mix of his autobiography and andres latest articles which is understandable since he likes forking and probably also looks up to andre in a way
356118,agree
356119,am doing a study on community managers in web3 to better understand responsibilities tools used and pain points would love to connect with community managers here who are open to sharing their experiences perspectives will reciprocate by sharing aggregate insights once done feel free to dm
356120,interesting
356121,biggest pain point is bots and scammers
356122,biggest pain point is dealing with over invested fudders who might be asking legit questions
356123,project x keeps giving announcements and integrations but why price no going up this u mean
356124,this is easy you ban them if they are really interested they start their own community in the process making the project more decentralised
356125,bad idea you talk with them try to reason empower them to suggest changes and direction at this stage they peacefully fk off cause they r usually larps
356126,they come back with a new account trust me community management is the hardest job lol
356127,if we are to onboard the next billion users banning a couple hundred now wont hurt right
356128,oh rly
356129,only work if you have a full time mod
356130,even then its bad rr
356131,i am a mod hire please
356132,only reason i can think of is for optics
356133,entire space is optics and narratives still
356134,at some point announcement of an announcement in fact couple of days back ive seen an announcement which isnt even announcement of an announcement
356135,what are you even doing in cryptodefi if you have such authoritarian beliefs
356136,fork the community bro
356137,the frontend is decentralised no
356138,1 discuss with them in a civilized way make sure their fud is addressed for everyone to see2 either they are happy now or at least act constructively3 if that is not the case they disrupt 24h mute4 if they continue after those 24h perma mute
356139,this is why alex will have food on the plate next bera
356140,banning in general makes little sense to me if you can just put people on readonly but some people have mental issues that require them to be muted or they will disturb others
356141,basically what i said with extra steps
356142,crypto is based on open discussion open source code open access to any user and game theorise correctly so bad actors dont have much to abuse with that open access
356144,you dont need to be in the chat to use an app
356145,lol let him try
356146,extra steps are important here if you just ban them outright they will go into martyr mode and rally more people around them victim narrative is strong
356147,you give them too much credit
356148,if they are that capable you just created a monster which is good for the industry overall no
356149,ivangbi how have this group analytics been since the market top and now frequency of chats ppl leavingjoining would be cool to check since the nft drop lobsters kind of became mainstream
356150,its less effort than you think usually their point has been addressed anyway and you can just point towards that time in the chat if not you can see it as building a knowledge base faq within your telegram
356151,community is a brand if you dont differentiate your brand you die easiest way to differentiate is barriers to entry
356152,ideally sure but doesnt really work that way in practice
356153,good question actually top tier devs left the scene as they became less active in general and burned out the defi devs of the summer are not even active much on twitter anymore either they exited during the noise period and will be back or they decided to turn down their social exposure cause of stress newcomers are now getting educated and washed out if they dont stand strong but if they do they will be the new founders and 10x in x years lower noise and lower scam easier to have conversations
356154,imho
356155,it does i have done it for 4 years from the heights of the 201718 bull through the full bear also you have to consider that users who are actually willing to engage with your project are rare some people who initially fud or are behaving weirdly can become your strongest allys because in general they have the drive to waste their time in a chatroom
356156,for only a bit longer and i disagree
356157,are any of those projects listed on binance cos the cohort is different
356158,yes was a standard ico
356159,i would still ban them they are free to create their own community and follow the twitter to learn more
356160,thats real decentralisation no
356161,because in general they have the drive to waste their time in a chatroomthis doesnt register as effort for a real fudder
356162,imo daos and community are overrated rn projects are focusing on community to pump tvl and price instead of do the product and validate pmf first
356163,thats cos ppl like alex dont ban them lmao
356164,if you just turbo ban everyone on first sight you will not be able to make the distinction of whos a real fudder
356165,which makes the communities bloated with mercenaries
356166,which means brand suck
356167,and here we are
356168,worse it falls apart quite spectacularly once the number goes down and they are no longer interested in pretending to be a good community member
356169,toxic people i still mute of course but its worth to engage at least once
356170,average iq goes wayyyy down after community gets to certain size
356171,i dont know why culling is so controversial
356172,low iq is not the problem just set some rules for your main room and direct the spammerslow iq people to some sort of party room
356173,the other you moderate with iron first i do not ban much but i delete a lot and mute subsequently if they keep offending
356174,the trend i see is communities becoming smaller and smaller
356175,eventually replacing core teams
356176,thats the only sustainable way to buidl
356177,personally i dont autoban largely for my own amusement but after half a decade i doubt the outcome is practically different from those that do
356178,outcome the same
356179,just frontrun the badness and do it
356180,im not actually sure if something like ohms community can be effectively managed
356181,when ppls emotions gets going its very hard to stop that momentum
356182,no you dont just ban them basically the more hostile or passive someone is the more sacharine and polite you are in answering their questions it also helps to call them a bit on their behaviour after some time its all performance because its never about who youre dealing with but about everyone else they can rally into a dog pile you may know if a user is up to no good but the rest of the community may not understand and view your actions through the lens of you banning a reasonable user even if they are clearly shit stirring it creates more headache and alienates users rather than inviting them into it
356183,maybe you failed to build a worthwhile community in the first place if you have such massive issues
356184,if it was exclusive to one community sure
356185,does ethereum have a community
356186,is this tg a splinter of the ethereum community
356187,but theres nothing particularly special about this
356188,isnt that why ethereum is so stronk
356189,banning is ez way out but community management is an effort and that effort includes dealing with ppl who are otherwise frustrating most are just upset and unable to regulate
356190,simplisticallynumba go up woonumba go down whip out the
356191,its too big already but yes even they do community of devs
356192,guess we find out in a few years time when communities actually matter
356193,yeh community of devs
356194,immutability is not a fetish read this for example
356195,the only exceptions i have seen are those dont have to do with a project and even then people did get banned still
356196,remember cryptomedicated anyone lol
356197,can we all model our communities after this
356198,my take is tokenomics will get your thru year 1 pmf year 2 community year 3
356199,oh there was a movie about this moonfall
356200,would change 2 and 3 but otherwise maybe ye
356201,long term community is how web3 defines itself but i dont think itll play a role over the next 12 or so months
356202,hey guys can you suggest any trusted bridge to swap bnb to eth
356203,not wrapped just swap bnb to eth
356204,community development is an ongoing process and should be viewed as a useful extension on the project itself its not just some symbolic collection of friendly users hanging out in discord or telegram but its also about the potential of those users emotional investment is also important and having a solid user base who is prepared can make your life a lot easier when things pick up
356205,every active user carries a cost what you just described sounds nice but isnt ustainable
356206,it is when done properly
356207,
356209,ive been hanging out with the based ppl since like nov 2020 its boarderline disfunctional but the marginal cost is like 0that shit will go on forever
356210,small network of frens reduce overhead cost lol
356217,ser thats kinda bs how will idiots understand what are good protocols and then good protocols are silicon valley operated 1 signer ones cause they follow aml
356218,sorry but horseshit borderline spam sowwy xx
356221,his fingers are possessed with the ghosts of lightning hackers and crypto devs
356223,empower people to fix problems they will usually go away or continue larping on public forums with everreducing credibility 99 of larper dont want to actually do any work they just want other people to do it and pamp their bag
356224,lol when you do this long enough you will learn there is a chasm between token holder what community member ends up being a euphemism for and user
356225,yeah i am fairly aware of that as well as the whale larps
356226,when you make voting a tradable commodityyou get people with mbas on your board asking for more value extractionthen they leave the company slowly fixes itself and the cycle repeats
356227,i think religion is a good example to study
356228,nan
356229,lmao he almost said fridge on the blockchain wowvitalik ser blz stop resisting defi
356230,fridge on a blockchain can help store icecream melting points data onchain which can lead to helping design better icecreams tell me what you can do with defi other than getting liquidated blz
356231,like defi can barely retain its top founders forget customers i wish i was entirely kidding syaing this
356232,in your example it could help prevent ice cream liquidation
356233,breaking news blockchains find real usecase
356234,protip if your portfolio is negative being down on it will be positive10050 50
356235,solana fridge food rekt
356236,cardano is launching their evm sidechain looool
356237,this kid is the only one making in this market scamming cardano for grants ggwp
356238,icecream man needs to hedge ben jerries liquidation too seredit argh shoot i was late
356239,dis timing
356240,cardona is the real ethrium classic is the real ehthereum
356241,the only real competition to cardona is jacks solano
356242,what must be the total size of all the smart contract deployed on ethereum mainnet
356243,sovsignal we need to ping them up there is money on the table
356244,lfg
356245,similar to milkomeda
356246,no no lfg dont have money anymore they rugged with luna but cardano has p
356247,tfl has the money i think
356248,ha so maybe cfg instead
356249,lol yes
356250,yeah do has money just pretending like he doesnt
356251,and jump has money as well
356252,sers any readings on planning an it career blz
356253,you should be more specific
356254,planning a developer career project manager team manager scrum master
356255,hello gentlemen ive been working on a project and i wanted to do some market research do you think there is a place for an opensource etl tool for querying transforming filtering and saving evm based chaindata the tool works completely on the jsonrpc api which means that any evm chain you have an archive api for will work evm data is currently limited to historical and realtime events and method calls but blocks and transactions will be added in the future i have a first draft of the documentation and if any of you have some feedback i would greatly appreciate it maybe dm me so that we dont clutter the chat docs apollochainboundio
356256,this sounds a teeny bit like thegraphgraph protocol
356257,thats true the only difference is that here you have a bit more granular control over the data you want anything in the abi can be queried while for the graph protocols build subgraphs also theres no need for indexing so its a lot easier to go multi chain
356258,another thing that the graph doesnt have is historical method calls so lets say you want to call balanceof on an erc over the last 6 months for a certain account you wont be able to do that
356259,you could write a subgraph that indexes that and start indexing from whatever block you want as long as you have an archive node
356260,i think there was something else that works well with erigon but i cant recall off the top of my head
356261,its build szn be kindddd
356262,one thing i would request is for the data output to come directly to platforms you can use them in right now i would pay top dollars for a tableau bridge because nobody has set one up
356263,thats true but for quick research projects and the like it might not make a lot of sense and you mean trueblocks
356265,ah yeah
356266,for now the output options are limited to csv and a postgres db but i can definitely look into that thanks for the advice
356267,missed that bit initially but not needing any additional infra other than an archive node is defo nice
356268,yea its the most broken aspect rn like ffs i spend more tiem cleaning and formating data than analysing altho have been working on rpython more so its like a noob problem but theres enough noobs in market you can make a flow biz off
356269,so the way you describe your queries schema is with a custom easy dsl and its got functions like parse_decimals for transforming shitty data before saving it
356270,heres a simple example using that
356271,im literally texting from omw to airport let me ping y tmrw and not spam the chat here
356272,also big query has quite a comprehensive data set
356273,speaking of evm chains only for ethereum though right
356274,nice work
356275,the plan is to opensource the tool in the coming weeks and release it together with a research article on erc4626 usage across chains to showcase what it can do and what you can use it for
356276,ive compiled a short list of lobsters on gitcoin probably missed a lot of good folks from here would appreciate suggestions
356277,nice
356278,we at impossibleve been compiling notes for some gitcoin ill see if we noted down any more lobsterdao participants to add to the list
356279,i would be interested in this article where will it be published
356280,i will add a blog section on the documentation website and also post it on medium will share it here
356281,thats the problem actually not a scrum master anyway a dev or sysadmin like that
356282,pmiorg
356283,where can i find onchain open interest stats
356285,its a deliberate attack by tim draper
356286,my message was from last year dude lol
356287,yeah i searched icp talks
356288,and this is new piece
356291,gm guysi am looking for a ventureinvestment role more about my story i would really appreciate it if you guys shared or if anyone had any leads andor advice cheers
356292,do try lobsters hr and daily ape hr try to search for both telegram will pop em up gl
356293,thank you didnt know about lobster hr will post there
356294,hey guys does anyone remember the twitter thread that spoke about passive income and investing it was a good thread and one of the graphics was named tower of wealth
356296,not exactly the answer but also just throwing here
356298,i hear if you post your seed phrase on facebook thats a good way to find out
356299,all joking aside check if the sticker is damaged difficult to tamper with those
356301,yeah definitely a secure way to handle it the sticker can be messed with if you have some acetone as lpl has demonstrated on youtube
356304,theres no should be no firmware on a new device
356305,thats not entirely correct regarding fully functional rollups which do not exist yet since muhh multisigs missing fraud proofs etc bridges like hop only share the smart contract risk of cross chain bridges they are not subject to the chain reorg risks that cross chain bridges have which long term are the more fundamental risk vectorpmriviere
356308,and i just found out this happened as well
356309,im honestly not sure what this has to do with what i said but uh okay
356310,not really a bridge and not sure how trusted it is but i have used sideshiftai before for some small amounts
356311,1 sideshift
356312,underrated and very convenient product built by ogs
356313,polgyon is indexed too lemme know in dm if u need help
356314,no other risks imo i met with notional team a few weeks ago irl and its based on a negative dai and positive dai pool or smtjn to give u ur fixed interest
356315,fcash or something
356316,didnt you say that l2 tokens share the same risks as tokens bridged to alt l1s here
356317,this is not true due to reasons i posted above
356318,i said bridged tokens have the same risks regardless of where it ends up
356319,yea thats wrong
356320,vitalik also had a tweet thread about this topic
356321,its interesting you think the security properties of where it ends up has much to do with what im saying
356322,if you want to argue whether my favorite l2 is more secure than my favorite alt l1 by all means but thats not me
356323,
356324,the argument is not about security properties of where the tokens end up its about what happens on the chain where the tokens were sent from
356325,thats certainly your argument
356326,but not one i have any particular interest in
356328,well this is very specific to tokens isnt it
356329,hey guys i am looking for an independent blockchain security auditor with experience in soliditytruffleopenzeppelinevm chains who can take a look at our crosschain yield aggregator project zorrofinance before we launch do you have anyone you could recommend talking to
356330,for context we cant yet afford the prices of certik peckshield etc 100k and thus want to start with 1 2 independent auditors
356331,lets pivot to a discussion of local crime rates when talking about the inherent safety of flying
356332,yeah its completely unrelated didnt read discussion
356333,just wanted to disagree with vitalik
356334,hehe
356335,ever so slight tangent youre getting scammed paying certik even a halfeaten hamburger for an audit
356336,i couldnt agree more seeing the amount of projects getting hacked despite having received audits from certik
356337,please ctrlf on this would make u scroll back quite a bit but you will find
356338,not having the same convo again and if you mention certik i suggest reading up back quite a bit 3
356339,i agree with you fwiw was just describing the oddity that led to that link even showing upwhat would happen if multichain had gotten exploited
356340,thanks i had gone through previous posts and wanted to see if any new recommendations had come up but totally fair i will go through the old posts
356342,are you sure youre understanding the argument a security risk for a token bridged to altl1 that does not exist for tokens bridged to a fully functional rollup1 deposit x a tokens into bridge contract on mainnet 2 x a tokens are minted on altl1 3 mainnet gets reorged without inclusion of the deposit transactionnow you have x less a tokens in the bridge contract than a tokens on altl1 which means your tokens on altl1 just got rekt
356343,we were discussing about tokens ser so dont understand this comment
356344,that was the original question that coiner replied to
356345,what do you think reorgs have to do with exploited bridge tokens
356346,do tokens on l2 inherit security of l1 tokens
356347,
356349,please coine_r figure out an argument you are actually having or go to dms just bloody confusing and cant understand anything
356350,me too ser
356351,kinda difficult to do with someone who refuses to join a good faith discussion but fair enough dropping it
356355,lasseclausen so its effectively 3 times cheaper in this case to pay via nxm for the same size
356356,100kis that the average per audit i would say it could be higher
356357,does nexus cover in this one quick depeg of a collateral like in luna case where the solvency of the protocol becomes at risk its not techncally an oracle failure or an economic attack just insolvency due to collateral type similarly does it cover depeg of usdt its also not techncally an oracle failure or an economic attack just insolvency due to collateral typehughkarp where is the best place to learn these specifics for notional cover
356358,dyor
356359,imagine buying insurance in crypto
356360,
356361,fuck you but you are right
356362,so no it does not
356363,not for volatile apys but if i enter a fixed 5 position pay 05 insurance i can sleep with 45
356364,if they are paying out yes
356365,unfortunately the insurance doesnt cover much here given the main risk is the assets and not the contracts given those were fairly tested
356366,this seems to be the case thought btw lit good to know that insurance got cheaper thanks to the token model kinks
356367,yeah also more likely stablecoin depeg is not covered also cant sleep cuz of private keys rekt
356368,i know insurace has a stablecoin depeg insurance they paid out a lot of claims after the ust depeg
356369,
356370,their product is unusable tried to deploy several static websites through fleek always failed and stuck with ipfs instead truly a clown show even tried using their sdk to test it out sure it worked but i dont trust any nodes to be alive much longer to even keep it hosted probably one of the major vaporwares of this cycle
356371,wondering if anyone knows of a reliable standalone event monitor for evm chains that can populate a db and knows where it left off if rebooted after downtime something simple but robust spec events to track columns and tables to map to and reboot as many times as you want is always up to date as long as it has an archive node to ping
356372,running a graph node is probably good for that
356373,yeah allergic to graph just need a simple daemon
356374,short answer is nexus doesnt cover for losses from asset price movements basicallyif there is a protocoleconomic bug which could be triggered by extreme asset price movements that leads to collateral in the protocol being taken then that is covered
356375,see the cover wording doc linked on that page for details its only 23 pages
356376,
356377,new ammo lobsters
356378,you mean realtime or historical events
356379,realtime but able to catch up from historical when needed
356381,autodestructing telegram private message
356382,encrypted yourself file with a voice message or a fuzzy image maybe a video if you fancy the work never text
356383,when you have a technical question about trading crypto where do you go im talking about questions such as best places to short small cap coins how to see onchain that a cex has gone bankruptfaileddisrupted and what is the most efficient way to hedge against increasing volatility searching such questions on google is a disaster you just get blogspam telegram and discord are rough when searching for questions that people have had in the past and stackexchangeoverflow are great for softwareside questions but not for tradingside questions the only option i see available to me is to ask it in niche discordtelegram communities and hope that someone feels like responding but im sure that others have had these questions in the past and that this information has to be out there somewhere
356384,what was the website with vcs rounds and vesting schedules want to check how many tokens are down from latest round
356385,you can also ctrlf in those communities
356386,vestlab is the most popular i know of
356387,challenge ive got crypto on the mind 247 and then i have to context switch to stuff that normies talk about i feel like i either 1 lose interestattn on what theyre talking about if its not nfts eth etc or 2 i lose them if i jam those topics into the convohow do you handle ignore it find other people with similar interests something else
356390,its okay to share what youre working on with them and help them understand if theyre interested but also try to open up yourself to other topics its just as any other passion
356391,id say this is my default i ask more about them than share about mecrypto to me this highlights one of the benefits of being in a region with cryptofriendly population more chances to find your flock who also share your other interests like cooking climbing etc
356392,its actually not a bad idea at all lol they have been repaying quite a lot recently
356393,what protocols ser nexus
356394,yes i saw typically a 5m payout last month on a rari exploit
356395,i am talking about nexus
356396,i found other hobbies for example i study a particular language i ended up just making friends with people who speak that language but are also into crypto as well even if they arent 247 about it they at least get it when i talk to them about certain things i just dont get too intense unless they also happen to be intense about it too they have their own groups and its groups where i can kind of be myself and unwind rather than crypto me it helps kind of normify in a certain way and lets me open my mind a bit more towards other things plus they also happen to be able to help me on my own side projects so it is win win
356397,but unfortunately i have difficulty connecting to normies in general even crypto normies however thats what helped me take a breather from crypto at times
356398,try microdosing mushrooms before your next social interactions could help and please let us know how it went
356399,or take a large dose and then please definitely let us know how it went
356401,nan
356402,celsius halted withdrawals
356403,link or sauce please
356404,i saw these and want to be able to confirm reliable source to avoid fud
356405,
356406,just got email from celsius
356407,damn thanks david
356408,
356409,wow
356410,celsius wallet
356411,seems like they are preparing for another steth dump
356412,so the otc with alameda didnt happen
356413,or they dumping after that
356414,chart seems healthy
356415,i really hope they dont blow up
356416,question is this not what people recommendedclaimed terra shouldve done
356417,please please please dont blow up
356418,in terras case i think the idea behind pausing redemptions was to avoid death spirali dont think cel has a direct connection with the funds performance or aum
356419,i dont either they didnt say anything about using cel
356420,but id guess its just the only way to play this new information
356421,here i guess pausing withdrawals helps them avoid running out of reserves bc they only have so much eth versus steth
356422,not the same as terra was playing with their money rather than playing with peoples money
356423,cel is down 70
356424,they need to pause because if not they risk making their steth position liquidable
356425,they moved like 300m to the address in order to collateralize it further
356426,okay but isnt that their entire mo
356427,oh
356428,most if not every single asset is currently on that wallet
356429,so lads 2008 of the crypto world is here
356430,yeah probably pausing a run on the bank
356431,terras
356432,and getting the position healthier with funds not intended for that
356433,no celsius
356434,ah yeah
356435,retarded takes incoming
356436,trust is lost already
356437,
356438,who in their right mind will trust celsius after this
356439,yeah the point isnt trust the point is that if they default on its customers then its gg wp
356440,i mean some of the big whales in there would probably take a cut right
356441,at this point its hoping they dont blow up rek consumers and set the industry back 12 years from a regulatory standpoint
356442,didnt luna already do that p
356443,luna already did that at this point its just rubbing salt in the wound
356444,nan
356445,gg wp crypto winter for quite some time regulations
356447,were in it for the tech right
356448,yeah itll bounce back but just wont be the wild west type of feel when it does
356449,were in it for the anal
356450,sslurpin the dip right guys
356453,telegram formatting is ass
356454,is it too soon to start a joke about being incel
356455,i would but i have no more money
356456,joking about it is really all we can do right now
356457,boiss if celsius defaults were gg
356458,theres also usdd they r putting more btc as collateral and now reducing rates already lack collateral eventually blow up
356459,that would be the death blow after luna desaster
356460,wont be as big tho
356461,i hope it does
356462,tbh its going to be bigger imho celsius had a lot more reputation than luna
356463,ponzis dying is good
356464,i agree but another ponzi will come and everyone will jump in
356465,what is gained from liquidating celsius and scaring off retail years of lower trading and mev fees
356466,how is celcius ponzi
356467,not entirely theolir fault imo
356468,umm needing fresh funds to come in to pay out existing depositors
356469,were they yield farming with peoples funds
356470,yeap that is why the whole steth eth peg was important
356471,jeez how leveraged were they you would think they would anticipate a depeg
356472,they also deposited like 500m into the eth2 deposit contract which is not great
356473,maybe a lit bit of false confidence after avoiding ust
356474,
356475,if you count the transfers from 2 days ago its about 10050 wbtc total 260m
356476,an hour or two before they close the withdraws
356477,but the peg isnt broken its not like lido has had their eth slashed what has changed is the market liquidity which seems weird thing to not consider for celsius before taking such a large position on it without a way of unwinding
356478,sorry yes and calling it a peg is just wrong there is no peg intended its just a price and yes im not entirely sure why cant they unwind it id think that theyve deposited a shit ton of user liquidity into eth2 contracts someone said 500m but i havent checked that information
356479,anyone know how to short celsius for americans
356480,ftx
356481,americans cant use ftx
356482,
356483,does that liquidation have something special apart from the 420k doesnt seem as big to be a big thing
356484,
356485,
356486,
356487,this is a good read
356488,are there any good crypto subreddits left
356489,its either a matter of hours until asia arrives or the day begins at 7am
356490,eh asia has arrived a while back its upto euro bros now
356491,and how do you understand that it has become difficult for others to understand youi have such a problem i understand you very much

356509,eth ico buyer
356510,2509 days ago was the day ethereum went live
356511,its been long
356512,buying 560k eth with ico wow
356513,those are some truly impressively strong hands i must admit
356514,genesis block of ethereum blockchain
356515,
356516,ouch
356517,i see transfers out on etherscan within the last 2 months lol
356518,daym 30k eth transfers to 3 different wallets probably his 3 children or side
356519,so much for lost keys
356520,just wait till satoshis premine moves
356521,lol that would be fun to watch
356522,bloomberg news satoshi livesthought to be improbable for a decade bitcoinsthe cryptocurrency markets premier assetfrom a wallet believed to be owned by the pseudonymous creators satoshi have been moved bitcoin btc is currently trading 75 lower than it started the day following the event and there appears to be no end in sight a titanic moment if there ever was one
356523,link ser
356524,issa joke ser lol
356525,exquisitely written
356526,

356530,
356531,most possibly he needs the world he thinks it should be
356532,midwits at celsius still have a 235m debt positon on comp position that is in danger
356533,can someone explain the celsisus situation were they risking peoples funds or just letting them add funds to a vault and but the user chose the risk typeit almost sounds like average joe deposits stables gets some apr but actually celsisus does various stuff with their funds to attempt to get apr perhaps perceived as low risk
356534,the former
356535,lobs how safe is dai as a stablecoin
356536,compared to usdc for example
356537,thats kinda crazy if they were taking btc eth borrowing stables to then do more margin defi but explains how they gave the apr

356562,why not 69420
356563,well im not a monster
356564,that will be a top calling again if it happens
356565,
356566,right about now it seems
356567,which one is usdd again the tron ust copycat
356568,yes
356569,
356572,its justin sun not do kwon it can happen but not extreme
356573,someone from ms did inform when this report came out that they will not wait for btc to get this level before they add to col
356574,nan
356575,
356576,usdd is just as flawed as ust literally just as flawed because its the same thing
356578,did he actually deploy the 2 billionoh lmao i thought this was the same shit he made a few weeks ago
356579,usdd will depeg to 0 by design
356580,im not saying it cant happen in the future but usdd is like 700mil mcap currently while as do needed outside funds to do anything justin doesnt when usdd mcap get to 10 or 15bil than we can start the countdown
356581,again this is not an opinion
356582,no arguments about flawed or not this is not sustainable 100 having said that there is still time for the ponzi to run
356583,it may not happen this week or next week or it may but it will happen eventually
356584,sure if you wanna play musical chairs just remember it costs 7 year to short usdd on justlend with almost no downside risk nfa
356585,yes calling for usdd or trx to go to 0 now is premature very early stage
356586,if you really wanna farm the rewards i would borrow usdd against usdtusdc on justlend and farm with it this way you have no exposure to usdd price
356587,dont be a usdd bagholder seriously no one will feel sorry for you this time
356588,only 700mc usdd sun has enough money to save it
356589,
356590,he is one of the richest man we know by onchain
356591,he is already in the process of saving it
356592,there is no hope for you im sorry
356593,no plans to farm or hold usdd see potential to make money in trx the wave will come
356594,lol
356595,plus if it depegs u only have to pay back usdd
356596,i dont use usdd
356597,lol isnt justin like half of all defi tvl
356598,thats what i meant yeah
356599,tbf to him harder to raise money in down markets better in rapidly rising market to deploy quickly his normal size makes dips harder gets frontrunetc
356600,and therefore he will donate all his money to you even if he keeps funneling billions everyone else can short at almost 0 risk on justlend
356601,there are already over 300m usdd borrows there
356602,usdd is the way for exiting his trx position
356603,is justlend the only place where you can borrow usdd dont feel safe shorting usdd in justinsuns backyard
356604,same tbh i wish there was
356605,steady lads dont worry about specifics eye on the prize
356606,are you shorting now
356607,what does his money got to do with you or i
356608,still gotta look at justlend admin risk
356609,nan
356610,to keep the ponzi going he will have to keep buying usdd effectively longing with 100 risk vs 0 risk shorts
356611,similar to jumps ust bailouts
356612,usdd marketcap is 700 mln though can be doable amount for justin sun to deal
356613,0 risk shorts you think justin will have an issue about buying 700mil of all usdd in circulation wow so you speculating imminent crash of usdd and trx with it please tell me if you have even one current open short position of usdd or trx
356614,as i said i dont trust justlend yet so i dont have exposure
356615,if justin buys 700m shorts can also borrow 700m at effectively no cost and no risk
356616,there is binance or any other exchanges to short trx
356617,nan
356618,cant he buy and hold thus leaving borrowers with no capital to borrow
356619,who here have info to be able to short usdd lets help nourharidy to make some
356620,trx can pump just like luna usdd on the other hand cannot no one has to short trx for it to go to 0
356621,with all due respect i cant believe im having this conversation again
356622,everyone knows its ponzi it will crash one day all im saying is that saying its imminent is very premature also saying shorts having 0 risk is ridiculous timing is key
356623,
356624,here we go
356625,he is smart guy gives more colla for the trust lose nothing
356626,i believe usdd fate in this period only depends on how commited justin sun is marketcap is only 700 mln he for sure has the money to fully back usdd in case it depegs will he though is different question need to accumulate trust in that period and delay the crash
356627,agreed timing is key if you wanna time it good luck i wouldnt touch this except by borrowing usdd either to farm or short
356628,usdd shorts do have 0 downside risk only 7 yearly interest unless justin is somehow gonna pump usdd to 2
356629,wait why is usdd 300 backed wasnt the point to build algostable how does it scale then
356630,probably lower collateralization in a bull market
356631,for now need to bolster confidence
356632,
356633,this is your last warning if you bought usdd remember no one will feel bad for you this time
356634,
356635,
356636,
356637,guard against shorts
356638,the supposed collateral is made up of a bunch of stuff including burned trx and capital designed to be spent to maintain the peg theres a lot of loose semantics at play
356639,oh yeah i see so trx is counted in that collateral makes sense then
356640,like lfgs btc reserve was supposed to be valve stopping lunas death spiral
356641,how about a more compassionate approach this time people dont like warnings aka fud on the coins theyre holding its kinda personal on some levels something more like hey guys weve seen it once with ust and luna i have similar concerns with usdd thots
356642,well thats just soft fud
356643,exactly
356644,it opens conversation
356645,kinda you have 723 million in burned trx although i believe this is essentially the collateral and theyre not really frozen and then you have 13 billion in stablecoins bitcoin and trx but these funds arent collateral theyre used for maintaining the peg so the 270 collateralization isnt very accurate terminology
356646,we didnt see this happen years ago its been 3 weeks since ust depeg there is no excuse this time and no victims to be compassionate for
356647,are you happy in general
356648,we need to clean the market from all this fake cefi services
356649,oh ok you mean no compassion for the team doing this type of scheme i got u
356650,no no compassion for holders eitherif you put half your face into acid which said cotton candy and it melts and then 3 weeks later you decide imma try my luck with this new barrel of cotton candy this one sizzles blue instead of green it is difficult to feel compassion for such a level of retardation
356651,lol case n point alright then why even warn them
356652,because they can still get out before it is at 0
356653,its too late lol all or nothin for these guys it seems
356654,and then when the rekt happensjustin sun is to blame for the ponzi not the victims that funded it to the tune of 10 or 15 bil im innocent retail
356655,guys what do u think about that if eth drops to 11k12k the liquidation pressure from defi will be about 900 million mainly from aave makerdao and compound
356656,if
356657,is it possible to find out how many assets will be liquidated at the price of 1112k eth
356658,would expect that theres a dune dashboard
356660,best platform to short eth on ethereum
356661,and anywhere to short steth
356662,opyn
356663,euler and lend fare
356664,maybe parsec finance has the answer but u need to
356665,hey guys doing a bit of research on celsius debacle is there anything more to just rumors that alamedabankman is behind the attack on celsius andor lunaust earlier so far ive seen only allegations but nothing definite to back them up
356666,nothing to back up except what u see with why funding rate positivenegative so much and eth outflows steth inflows etc
356667,surprised that its not bigger 01 of all crypto market cap seems small
356668,were all poorer so defi got a whole lot smaller
356670,hello gyus can someone explain me about maker dao1 how can i participant in maker protocol auctions for liqidation debts2 where can i see size of maker buffer
356671,
356672,yeezy_yeezuscapital
356674,not heard anything about an attack by ftx but a lot of steth is being deposited to ftx which is unusual since its not a listed pair edit i verified wallet market as ftx is here it now has 128k steth in deposits and i was incorrect steth is a listed pair
356675,1 2
356677,it is listed
356678,against usd
356679,where is the parsec board
356680,arent we nearing the 900m fiasco or not yet
356681,
356682,anyone got the wbtc and eth liqudations charts in front of them and would be kind enough to sahre
356683,nan
356684,seems too small
356685,the 12hr one is pretty good size
356686,defi tvl has shrunk a lot and people probably are less leveraged than a few months ago
356687,open interest more like open to job offers
356688,well crypto mcap is below 1b now so
356689,1b lol
356690,sorry 1t
356693,i remember ethereum below 1b mc all the smart contracts used to be ponzi its completely different now rright

356729,if you are worried about installing the app than you shouldnt look at 3rd party vpn services at all
356730,there are open sources protocols to use install your own vpn and use then

356739,so it seems like eth liq cascade didnt hit the price by like 10 bucks only
356740,night still young
356741,quick q if the guy that sold 63k eth on the market would have done it through flashbots aka making the price effectively 950 usd eth until next block making the twap update at that rate would that have triggered much more liquidations on euler
356742,too early
356743,i understand that the bonus would have been way smaller but the protocol would have suffered nonregular liquidations innit
356744,tether fud starting normally means a bottom

356752,whats up with avalanche aave v3 apr
356753,a single irregular price has almost zero impact on a geo mean twap thats why it costs billions of dollars to manipulate liquid token twaps because you have to push the spot price to zero or infinity without arbitrage so i dont think it would have made any difference really would have been negligible at best
356754,i guess there are scripts that harvest usernamesgoogle accounts when viewing public docs maybe google doesnt offer that as an api call its always worried me about public docs
356755,does that actually work embedding remote resources into a google docs that will be called by the viewers browser on load
356756,i just never interact with any links from my working machine
356757,
356758,google does not allow for this
356759,no i guess you need to open an embedded image iploggerru is a lot like canary token just by viewing no
356760,also if the document is public people do not even see your name and profile picture it is replaced with a place holder but generally its not wrong to open any link you receive with caution
356761,yeah just checked the difference wouldnt have mattered
356762,so unless you are trying to hide from google or assume they get compromised neither the private tab nor the vpn are adding any value its just general good practice in case you click an external link or something
356763,if the first might want to reconsider opening google links on an android device
356764,where can i learn more about this pls
356765,
356768,
356769,elon coin coinbase deserves to die fully
356770,dont we have enuff bear already stfu
356771,let us get over with celsius first
356773,wtf are they smoking lmaoooo
356774,crack cocaine
356775,sisa lol wwwvicecomampenarticlejmv7npsisacocaineofthepoorpart1
356776,us treasuries pulling a luna
356777,whts teh best thread out there on celsius systemic risk
356778,so its just laced meth
356779,you mean the opposite
356780,with electrolyte lmao
356781,persistently transitory dips
356782,heyo take a moment to check paradigm_fund fresh biweekly digest of updates that happened within the pos ecosystem for the latest updates on the project you are interested in please tap ctrl f name of the project
356783,too much or nah
356784,be sure to close your positions on ftx first
356785,dai is fully collateralized and decentralized but i would trust usdc first under sentiment and theyre institutional investor backed
356786,what about busd
356787,please use ctrlf
356788,for example you can find this
356789,
356790,is defi tvl just justin sun and celsius
356791,and ivangbi
356792,lol
356793,i think sbf also takes part in defi on certain farming opportunities
356794,
356795,maybe not
356796,this assumes all justin sun and celsius wallets are known also i think the justin sun share used to be much bigger at some point probably pulled out
356797,
356798,true and he had atleast 1 billion in aave at some point
356799,
356800,oof
356802,memes in kingdom
356803,get the nft and shitpost there
356804,poor fuckers support the community
356805,4b
356806,yeah most probably knew it was a lot more since that aave smart contract fud but couldnt remember how much
356807,other than the price catalysts are there any other factors for yfi tvl suffering as bad as it has over the last 8 months just yields dropping across the board
356808,fees being more than the yield
356809,lowkey going into negative almost
356810,10 apr for more than a year is a very hard thing to do defi too young to know this
356811,still no reason to charge 20 while yielding 0 in some instances
356812,why is defi learning everything from zero
356813,apr is easy to say inflation so the more apr the more inflationary it is
356814,did ppl forgot monaco
356815,because we are too smart for our own good
356816,hi all does anybody know of a good way or if its even possible to review all wallet activity of a particular defi protocol and then identify net purchases of a specific token over a fixed time period in each of those wallets en masse im looking for a way to basically filter out and export from a list of thousands of wallets any who have a net positive purchase position of a token over a fixed time period ive set
356817,
356820,if you only include direct dex interactions no cex stuff not going through 2nd 3rd wallets you can use dune to do something like that aggregating over dextrades table based on wallet addr
356821,1 youll need to find transactions between your address set and the dexpopular defi protocols address set and then do your own logic on top good thing about dune is it has all that defi address set already labeled
356822,thank you both
356823,kinda 1000 whales maybe
356824,it was a proxy question for someone im not sure what he needs it for
356825,could be the basis for an interesting indicator
356826,hey deacix please check dm
356827,
356828,devs need a new cashout route
356829,sir why wont you consider the poor devs
356830,
356831,insane times were in
356832,in an insane world
356833,a sane man must appear insane
356834,will vecrv be used for collateral too
356835,please mitch give us some muh utility
356836,u cant do it u cant move it
356837,liquidations would probably be strange yes
356838,well better just wait for them docs
356839,guys what are some of the best aggregation layer for storage networks in crypto currently
356840,
356841,old news but wow
356842,you can just have to get creative and permission from crv dao to deploy the type of system youd need to make it happen without any backwards compatibility
356843,whats the point of a 100th stable tho
356844,seemed like a joke probably idk
356845,i dunno just saying that you can make vecrv partially liquid we revest have done it twice now on fantom forks
356846,i agree with you not quite sure why anyone would want to intro a new stable rn
356847,
356848,heard that fiveguys pays well might need to see if this work 2 earn thing is worth it
356849,everyone sleeping on costco
356850,you see this
356851,im dumb but why would a delaware corp need a license from the state of washington
356853,you know what they saycostco keeps the costs low
356854,pays well 150 hot dog 5 rotisserie chickenwhat more do you need
356855,unsure of why im still in crypto when i can eat like a king and work for a powerful brand like that
356856,you have to meet the licensing requirement of each state you operate in
356857,may open them up to even more legal difficulties if customers were based in washington and celcius proactively chose to go against the regulators assessment for not granting a license
356858,
356859,everything makes so much sense now
356860,is it ogre
356861,will the two sams arb every penny out of the market
356862,yes so they can give back to the poor
356863,wow gas is quite expensive lmao
356864,liquidations happening everyone wants some
356865,no the white paper hardly ever changes and since eip 1559 was introduced last year i doubt it would the yellow paper however does get updated it doesnt have it either but there is hope it might some day
356866,if you want canonical definitions of how transactions work i would read the spechowever there is a significant amount of subjectivity with regards clients wallets estimate base and priority fees though
356867,hi frens are there any dev shops that stand out above the rest to you all i dont have any particular area of expertise in mind jw
356868,its not the wp but
356869,its under eip 2718 in the yellow paper
356870,shits confusing
356871,
356872,even hayes is fudding now smh
356873,he needs to learn how to thread better it jumps from 1 to 5 and i spent 30 mins searching for the rest
356874,nah this looks liike an enabler for it and not neccesarily eip 1559
356875,yeah just go to his profile and its better
356876,it took you 30 minutes to click on his twitter profile lol
356877,my am brain is very slow ser
356878,isnt this anti fud
356879,is ok my neurons are also fried
356882,its fud compared to his bottom is in at 25k article
356883,yes mempool is not within scope
356893,vecrv is literally the most useful token in defi
356894,i think they are talking about the part where he tells us to throw out the charts turn off our computers and start praying to lord satoshi
356895,lol protecting cedefi bags
356896,he said he would become bearish around the current levels
356900,yes
356909,these conversations should be encouraged so we know what to steer clear from terrific anti advertising really
356910,bots chatting to each other
356912,not that i would ever touch the piece of shit that is choise but now no one here will make that mistake
356913,the ai is sentient
356915,fuck governance token airdrops the last trend is subpoena nft airdrops
356916,
356917,thoughts on this
356918,just saw it
356919,thoughts on thoughts none
356920,either bring facts or leave yellow press for lobsterdao kingdom for fun
356922,
356923,he says its false
356924,he said the wallet is kucoin wallet instead of lunc dao
356925,i doubt why lfg would do it intentionally this would get caught for sure
356926,who got the tenderly newsletter
356927,your20mind
356928,tenderly have always been a step ahead with regards to dev tooling the only thing they need to figure out is proactive monitoring like forta
356929,hmm doesnt oz sentinel do something similar
356930,will have to reread docs i havent touched them in months when i last checked oz was very clunky
356932,ahhh sentinel bundles forta makes sense as they are also behind forta
356933,coinbase to cut size of team by about 18 link
356934,1100 people
356935,team grew 4x in the past 18 months adding new employees has made us less efficient not more
356936,happened last cycle too albeit an order of magnitude smaller in scale
356937,seems like an ideal usecase for a soulbound token
356938,how long until a better stableswap comes out
356940,stop with rumours backed by nothing
356941,why ser its what keeps us live during this bera
356942,this is likely to be correct the fatmans analysis kucoin was the first to list luna and every single investor moved to binance once they listed it
356943,and luna paid a big fee to kucoin to get it listed uwu this was like 2018 or 2019 mid bear market
356944,coinbase cutting 18 of jobs around 1100 peopleimplies they had 6000 employees v 3700 at the end of 2021that iswas an insane hiring ratelive news updates crypto exchange coinbase to axe 18 of staff ftcomcontent4ae499
356945,still too many
356946,hired too fast
356947,so they are still above 2021 number
356948,
356949,thats true for every litteral concept on earth you just have to trust the talent working on the project and the network effects
356950,hellonot a shill we are developing an ecosystem for better experience for gamers and project developers in web3we are looking for gamefi projects foundersdevelopersmanagers to ask several questions about your experience in creating and maintaining projects aimed at onblockchain gamingshoot me a dm if youre interested in making web3 a better place for everyone
356951,
356952,wwwarabianbusinesscommoneywealthalternativeassetsfinesjailtermsrevealedforpeopledealinginunlicensedcryptopaymentsorvirtualcurrencies
356953,looks like its more about people doing icos or generally marketingpromoting unlicensed tokens dont think it affects normal buying and selling for yourself atleast judging by that article
356954,nan
356955,yup agree badrinatarajan
356956,it was getting riduculous they was a massive billboard of floki inu a while back
356957,sounds like a backdoor to be in the position to persecute anything whenever they want
356958,they can do that already its dubai
356959,also true
356960,but it sounds better if it is backed by law rule of law and so
356961,
356962,what kind of jobs they are cutting it cant be devs right
356963,well they probably need a lot less customer support people now that they have 10x less users
356964,yeah true
356965,hard to believe coinbase was overstaffed on customer support
356966,they have devs
356967,know some devs that got cut
356968,they still need more customer support they havent answered my ticket from june 2017
356969,i dont think im ever getting my 100 worth of btc out of coinbase
356970,sue them
356972,just waiting for it to be worth 1m
356973,its fun only if you sue them at 100 suing at 1mil is just rational behavior
356974,
356975,i have so many questions about this tweet
356976,his excellency is nothing if not dank
356977,tbh this part i am not really sure about what is he deploying the capitals for defend trx price add liquidity to curve for usdd pool
356978,to steady the lads
356979,doesnt matter lol just posturing hes dank af as you say trx mkap is miles away from usdd mkap its a false alarm
356981,yeah which is why i think he is actually leaning in on all the fud around usdd being the ust usdd is small enough where he can actually defend the peg and build a narrative for retail about how based he is with his 200 collateralized stablecoin and hopefully create a richard heart cult before the next up only
356982,anyone know whats going on here
356983,
356984,same just saw no idea what this is about been a few hours we havent got any new drama for more down last we had was 3ac being margin called which was more than 4 hours back
356995,hello guys i need your help do you know an illustration where all parts of ehtereum are maybe something like this
356996,
356997,this illustration is unfortunatly with pow instead of the new pos thank you
356998,nono u were totally cool w ur post though
356999,ah wait u shared haha nvm unhussard all good just mute em
357000,what on earth happened with balancers market cap from 40m to 180m while price is down was there some weird unlock that cmc didnt have in already
357001,pretty sure they just didnt accurately track circulating supply for a while i remember checking not long ago and the vault had more bal in it than there was circulating supply on cmc
357002,well thats pretty annoying
357003,is the inflation schedule that high on bal
357004,is the inflation schedule
357005,that doesnt seem right though mc is up 5x and its been out for like a year and a half dont see it having 500 inflation in that time
357006,does anyone know the name of this website asked on the thread but no answer
357007,parsec finance
357008,whats sudden shill of parsec everywhere lol
357009,analytics and individuals looking for more reliable data
357010,useful tool tbf
357011,any parsec access for lobsters
357013,wasnt it useful before all ct shilled it after arthur discovered you can track on chain liquidations
357014,
357015,damn nexo worked like a charm
357016,what they mean is making their customers even more angry cause they sold the bottom its like reverse gamestop
357017,im wondering if their monetization strategy subscription service could work im more interested in that dbaas than the shilling
357018,
357019,kinda dumb
357020,well done really
357021,its not well done its a rug
357022,i think its good seed investors need to contribute for the project
357023,absolutely shafted
357024,how the f can u even do this
357025,usdn seems depegging again
357026,exchange rate usdndai including fees 09299
357027,refunding to value investor expected for not providing value wheres a rug here
357028,you have the network jump in seed round and having free money for doing nothing
357029,u signed an investment contract without kpis
357030,i think it needs to be changed for seed investors
357031,either agree a better investment contract or dont take the money
357032,man ygg 10b valuation at lbp moment put their name to mc and helped them to fundraise lbp with 100m was a result of ygg help
357033,contract without point that you cant be refunded this shows that some communities teams are actually care about the project i cant call this case perfect but its definitely outstanding
357034,no
357035,its a rug otherwise i will make a case tomorrow to say you do not give enoguh to municipality and take your house
357036,ppl care about their own bottom line
357037,rug
357038,ofc its a rug
357039,you can
357040,i mean the funniest thing is that merit circle is doing that to ygg based on the fact they did nothing but at the same time mc invested in 50 rounds already and is doing nothing as well in them
357041,disagree they added much value but shouldnt make much difference unless ygg were actively harming
357042,basically they let a rival invest in them and then realised it wasnt a good idea and thought theyd better shaft them
357043,they will get sued and itll cost them time and money
357044,good for mc then
357045,thats the case for passive freeriders where you throw money into smth and then doing only one action cashing out tier 23 fund approach
357046,just read the ygg valueadd report theres aint much
357047,again good case for the industry
357048,ur points are totally irrelevant if u sign an investment contract that doesnt include them
357049,that does not matter if you do not agree on certain metrics which are ideally included in the saft contract otherwise you just open the door for investors to get cancelled arbitrarily
357050,founders try giving funds lockups that arent 3m
357051,i mean what you can learn from that every paper with meritcircle ltd signature is worth 0while ygg in a round is worth 0 too
357052,the implementation is very questionable and dubious but getting rid of leeches for whatever definition of leech you prefer is not
357053,the dao failed to properly define and contractualize what they expect from their counterparty and are now after the risk has been taken just pushing them out
357054,gubernance in action eh
357055,the irony here is that the dao in question does exactly the same
357056,hardly its probably an inside proposal like all proposals everywhere
357057,isnt mc the leech here then they actively benefitted from a brand and then took away their profit
357058,im not surprised rules for thee but not for me is tradition
357060,hello everyone i was referred here as this might be a good place to find developers am i right or am i lost haha
357061,my friend check
357062,legend thank you
357063,can we also question why a guild invested in a guild in the first place why ygg invested and why was it allowed to invest
357071,please dont close the door for us blind riders kek
357072,i think many are scared because of that
357073,does anyone know of a good break down of the technical architecture of centralized exchanges
357074,most keep that close to chest however most whitelabels like openware of peatio fame and chainup of a shit ton of chinese white labels fame both have theirs public on their sites
357075,openware
357077,henlowhat the author fails to mention is that the original saft between ygg and mc transferred the authority over the vested tokens over to the dao ygg knows this every seed investor knows thisthe community can make free proposals as they wish im the one who wrote mip13 and called out a party that in my view didnt do much this is different to the merit circle ltd something not many people seem to understand they think the ltd rugged ygg this is not the casean open vote was held and then a counterproposal was made mip14 this is also not mentioned by many and the people lack contextboth mc ltd and ygg signed a contract agreeing with the counterproposal mip14 any word over a rug is nonsense and lacks perspective
357078,waiting to see u try this defence in court
357079,our dao decided to steal property of another entity but its decentralised so its ok your honour
357080,you seem to be confused the ltd and ygg signed something themselves and agreed with whatever was in the counterproposal
357081,good luck
357082,court and saft tell me you know nothing about subject without actually telling me
357083,eli5 token utility principles from spencer
357084,the moment ygg signs a new proposal though i doubt theres anything in that regard to discuss anymore
357085,employment opps in russia and celsius covered
357086,hi i would like to make a dao proposal to take all lobsters from random members that are not value addooors and give it to ivangbi i also want to hrie an hr team to do performance review of all nft holders going forward
357087,
357088,and this is why thread just to shill
357089,guys trivial question as i didn t try myself bc i m not on the tron chain but curiousis the redeem mechanism for usdd not active bc otherwise i do not understand why with all that treasury it is trading below 1
357090,this is something people like to say but isnt it impossible given if nothing else the way tokens are currently designed
357091,does anyone have real life examples of tokens that at least tick some of these boxes
357092,
357093,network tokens eth near etc get 1 does not add friction to the user experience assumes friction is a bad thing and maybe 3 for free stablecoins obviously get 1 for free lol
357094,hoping someone here will know when using dydx and leverage trading why does it reduce my leverage the more in profit my open position is feels like some kinda bs but im sure it must make sense somehow
357095,okay okay so basically it uses your unrealised profits to go against your current position and as your position stays the same you are effectively borrowing less for the same position so it reduces your leverage to suit makes sense
357096,chainlink
357098,ps redacted we do not do legal here only lawyers do legal only doctors do surgeries ctrlf on some twitter threads and just read jake lex some others
357100,ivan is shit so he is naturally shitposting
357114,mute next up kids
357115,has anyone ever been able to bypass the 10000 holder requirement for trust wallet to list a logo and token info
357116,we talking about merit
357117,nope just a message from a new member
357118,ahhhhh just seeing the tweet about them wondering if wed discussed it yet they done refunded the saft
357119,we did scroll up blz
357126,any tools to do quick due diligence on projects website
357127,
357128,wow
357129,huh
357130,for example if they copied some website or the photos of founders is fake etc
357131,just have common sense really
357132,is there service to quickly get full historical eth chain data blockchair offers node dump but slow and out of date
357133,so back to 250mil is it
357134,i may be reading the chart wrong but isnt that 250b
357135,on the right is the trading vol scale we are at 950b now it was obviously a joke
357136,until is isnt anymore
357165,i think that our defi space would benefit from having more relevant analytics all in one space if possible so we can keep up with the health of these funds or projectsi know its all out there but if a tool like this before more mainstream then its less likely for things like celsius to take place agree or disagree
357166,no project has suffered so far it was all centralized bs and platforms that have gotten rekt so no disagree because it is already open af
357167,countless dube dashboards for every project
357168,ust was centralized crap promise of do kwon holding the money celcius too whatever other firm too not relevant to defi
357169,how about vcs
357170,and no centralized firms wont and cant do full reporting probably
357171,does anyone have a list of 3acs ether addresses
357172,that is against their interest and wouldnt even change that much everyone knows they are levered up have prime brokerages but they cant disclose at what prices
357174,
357175,idk if theres a list you could find out researching their bags though
357177,
357178,not surprise 910 marriages end up in divorce
357180,plenty of rumors of 3ac blowing upgetting rekt
357182,
357183,
357184,wtf closing our doors to taking money out of other accounts is a big leap although i dont know exactly how those deals work
357187,
357188,ah yes this is like the livejournal and forum drama edit to add and myspace and etc i missed 20 years ago when every other person was drama posting like this lol
357189,point 4 in itself already is a dilemma
357191,any good threads on the full extent of 3ac
357193,
357194,yeah that ones best
357195,i just keep my short position
357196,nan
357197,defi blackswan the scariest thing
357198,brutal read really shows how bad this is going to get didnt see many people publicly calling 3ac going insolvent
357199,
357200,because people thought their tweets were psychops but they it looks like they were really that bullish
357201,this is my biggest fear tbh
357202,seems inevitable at this point though most of these huge vcs started dipping into all sorts of defi shit most of the alt l1s are severely down billions going to flow out
357203,what is a16z gonna do with 45b and katie with 15b loloh yeah and ftx has 2b investment fund as well
357204,we cant do anything now just wait for the news focusing on what we are doing
357205,i think the only thing to do is sit on the sidelines and if youre a builder start coming up with the next game changing thing for next cycle
357206,i would not actively want to be the head of any live project right now personally
357207,its scary how much worse its going to get lmao i dont mean to sound like a fear monger but fuck man is it not bleak lol
357208,why do you think big funds just invest and dont hedge their every investment or short
357209,because only up
357210,they are waiting for deploying it
357211,those are proper vc funds so i highly doubt they hedge itif they cant deploy it they return it
357212,in what
357213,new game new ponzi etc
357214,they drank their own kool aid pretty much
357215,i have personally seen many waiting deploying but many do hedge every position
357216,so they will be playing among themselves because no one else has money left
357217,funding continues not as radical and heavy for example 400 million raised across multiple projects this past week
357218,i mean yeah these people probably started raising in april or may and got closed now would be interesting to see how they respond if you go to them now
357219,agree blocks ama for members from yesterday shared that funding for defi was down 40 but good projects continue to get funding in gaming etc guilds which raised more than 100 million like mc guildfi continue to invest probably at even better terms and vals no more 100 million seed rounds for sure
357220,haha might actually see trash getting clean now
357221,true one can track projects raising funds now and look for new themes new plays too
357222,funding is lagging data give till august
357224,in my experience it is getting a lot more difficult to raise significant changes in the last 60 days for sure
357225,
357226,hi guys is there a dashboard that tracks convex pools tvl in token amount not in value i am trying to understand how much is withdrawn from the pools
357227,
357228,not good they are selling nfts
357229,
357230,read thread
357231,what does his name mean cephalopod_v7_final_2xlsx
357232,no clue lol
357233,oh thats the dude that brought up tether fud last month tired of this
357234,
357236,nan
357237,check the next tweet is a hash
357238,is there a stablecoin available thats backed by a mix of other stablecoins eg usdtusdcdai
357239,dai basically
357240,dai
357241,usdc is most secure
357242,usdp or busd too
357243,mstable
357244,is backed by basket of stables by design
357245,rsr
357246,nirvana on solana but its a very niche ultra low mcap project tread carefully
357247,thanks for answers was asking because the ocassional usdt fud now i just spread it by having multiple types of stablecoins but thought might be easier if i could do the same but with just 1 asset
357248,mstable wouldnt cut it then they have usdt in the mix
357249,hm 3crv pool is imbalance now
357250,
357251,tether has currently zero exposure to celsius apart from a small investment made out of tether equity in the companytether is aware of other rumours being spread suggesting that it has lending exposure to three arrows capital again this is categorically false
357252,
357253,painful read but a good one
357254,has been for weeks months
357255,
357256,
357257,maybe we mute uncorroborated undocumented stable fud be it usdt or usdd idc this is not a place to guzzle fear in the midst of downturns
357258,what buys scams means
357259,pmriviere
357260,f i have a lot of usdt
357261,fud isnt easy to categorize as fud especially in usdts case i guess until after such a statement is made
357262,fud is absolutely ok if corroborated and documented bringing up 3pool imbalance is neither
357263,its just lagged panic imo some people dont pay attention to any of that stuff until theyre forced to
357264,yep so share stuff in this group if you do pay attention else just read people who do
357265,information asymmetry basically
357266,
357267,maybe people fud cause they dont have any info huh did u think that
357268,ok ivan have a potato
357269,does anyone know anything more about the 3ac implosion
357270,anyone from dappradar here was wondering if dappradar has api for their data
357271,on their site
357272,the dappradar api is currently in development stay tuned for more updatesmostly interested is it available already or whats etaedited got the answer amazing group
357273,
357274,any tool available that calculates the total gas spent on txs from a specific account
357275,feeswtf but for eth only
357276,dune
357277,super wizard of dune
357278,is there any 3ac liquidation watch party
357279,there was a chart circling around yesterday showing most liquidations will come in sub 1k eth we are pretty close 3ac wont be this exciting if we reach that level
357280,in it for the tech anyway
357281,
357282,is there big opportunities if 3ac is liquidated
357283,rsv and soon rtokens
357284,put your bid way below the market
357291,if they get liquidated on their eth is the aave protocol obliged to sell it at market value
357292,ya applying to non crypto jobs now before everyone else
357293,didnt they already get liquidated on aave for the big one
357294,not yet just inches away from liquidation
357295,yes aave has to cover the borrowed amount by selling liquidated eth on the market price
357296,
357297,which particular markets does the aave protocol use during liquidations uni v3
357298,aave protocol isnt using any markets for liqudiations it just sells with a discount users position to anyone willing to buy the rest is upon the liquidator he may use flashloans may use cex may just hold
357299,what is this slow grind
357300,whats their liquidation price anybody knows
357301,993
357302,nan
357303,milkyklim is there a deadlinetimeline to replenish the fixedforex mim pool people in the kp3r group are panicking big time all ibassets are deppegged and noboby from the team seem to care about firex forex anymore obviously we all with andre was still there
357304,how check this pls help
357305,or should be expect forever deppegging
357324,blz for kingdom letsbuidl very welcome to share there otherwise a small product message is ok as long as its unique
357328,above cheers
357332,looks nice how exactly is it different from zapper
357334,fren alternative to zapper invite here would be better than wall of text thanks tho logging in
357347,probably its just me but i cant read tg messages which are longer than 1 iphone x full screen just cantscrolling to the bottom and ignoring it as spamps this is why we keep 57 max topics in lobs daily
357352,hi lobsi am building personalised defi deep analytics platform focused towards investorszapperzeriondebank will provide you with the current snapshot of your portfolio with higher level info of your portfolio but not historical we help investors confidently grow financially in defi by giving them access to deep historical data insightsalso were working on simplifying accounting for web3income capital gainslosses gas feesetc across chains combined
357353,looks cool what was the idea that led you to building such a platform
357354,because i was pissed of switching between multiple tools to get my positions across chains wallets honestly i was not happy after all the existing tools so thats was the push
357355,thats nice what positions are you tracking is this built on subgraphs or are you indexing the txs yourself
357356,sup guyscould you tell me what oracle aave lending protoocl uses for eth price
357357,right now were dependent on txns from there we source directly from the contracts but we will setup our indexers soon to feed live data
357358,learning from the stablecoin bridging space is there a better solution in terms of lp incentivization provision management and fees other than synapse
357359,chainlinks official price feeds
357360,whats not ok with debank seems like they have most
357361,they just provide you the higher level of the wallet like say how can you get the idea on impermenant losses
357362,and while the market is falling the margin positions of the whales continue to grow with great speed the longs ratio in the btcusd pair on bitfinex has already exceeded 107700 coins
357367,
357368,hedging spot selling
357370,this is crazy shit
357371,apparently tron dao transfered 100m usdc in binance to buy trx and then withdrawed 25b trx dont know how this helps the usdd peg
357372,kansas city shuffle ser
357373,more to prevent people shorting trx since to short on perps you need to borrow the underlying token
357374,cant short trx if theres no trx to borrow on binance
357376,how to withdraw 25 bn trx too pls mah familiei dont really get it they bought or just asked their mm to withdraw
357377,the longs ratio in the btcusd pair on bitfinex has already exceeded 107700 coins what does this means
357378,to short trx perps no need for underlying token
357379,i dont get who has the balls to short trx here with this funding thothere is no redemption function for the general public between usdd trx unlike with lunaustthe shit is also 200 collateralizedpending short squeeze imo
357380,nan
357381,quite interesting
357382,bbbut they told me emissions were a ponzi
357384,real collaterisation is more like 125
357385,it isnt its around 81 the rest is tron
357386,youre aware that he sent like 700m usdc couple days ago right
357387,even if you exclude trx its nearly at 200 with usdc usdt and btc
357388,then why is it at 097 right now
357389,like i dont like usdd dont take it like that
357390,redemption mechanism is centralized and they arent using it right now
357391,agreed makes no sense the real trade is the 4 funding rate nodownside assuming 1 entry usdd short on justlend tbh
357392,188m in borrows
357393,btw i checked justlend admin risk comptroller and market contracts are all owned by a 48hour timelock which is owned by a governoralpha gov contract
357394,that being said usdd oracle seems to be manually updated not chainlink definitely quite some oracle risk there
357395,trust in his excellency kek
357396,if youre a justlend depositorborrower you probably wanna keep an eye on the 48hour timelock once a day
357397,the ecb keeps the printer on
357399,how often is the mim pool refilled ibeur badly off peg indeed
357400,so annoying can probably burn my euros in winter cheapest option to get some heat
357401,i dont see where it says brr
357402,reconducting pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp means they wont offload their balance sheet but keep growing it because of fragmentation
357403,not clear what this new antifragmentation instrument is but means brrr
357404,ya read somewhere else that they want so shift money from expiring bonds from stable countries to new bonds in the south
357405,should probably get some dollars
357406,yes probably something like this more targeted relieve packages
357407,how much brr this is the only chart i was able to find
357408,theres only this press release i dont have more info than anyone else
357409,not looking like the purchases are going down
357410,seems they changed their mandate from keeping the prices stable to keeping interest rates equal
357412,i think they decided on two things1 previously their balance of government bonds had to follow a certain allocation formula as per shares of member countries in ecb now they can ignore this allocation and overweigh eg italian bonds while underweighting germany goal decrease differences in bond interest rates between ecb members2 develop a new instrument with the same goalso 2 is tbd might be more brrr also they are obviously facing an impossible tradeoff looking at inflation numbers
357415,
357422,
357424,wait why is fatman suddenly pro tron
357425,
357426,its do quote
357427,by my hand dai will die
357428,bahahaha
357429,dai still alive and kicking
357430,
357431,someone know where to find the link at pcv fei core asset
357432,what do you mean the link you can see pcv here
357434,a friend was offmarket liquidated this morning at 12utc on 1m worth of cel 12 when the price was below 07ftx has been ignoring his support requestsplease retweet to help get an answer
357435,i am having a similar issue i had a long btc open with a lot of room between my margin fraction and the maintenance margin requirement and got partially liquidated almost half of my collateral
357436,already submitted support tickets sent emails and tried to contact them through social networks
357437,what the f was this
357438,is nirvana a stablecoin
357439,i dont know too much fuckery
357440,sbf we need our money back and we want answers
357441,besides opening tickets with ftx and sending emails and social media messages if anyone know how to further help it would be great
357442,this is really something
357443,im not actually sure how is this even possible
357444,how they executed this manually topkek
357445,ftx ux went down yesterday and this liquidation happened today while price went 067 at max
357446,ftx responded which makes no sense because i had plenty of room
357447,is this you
357448,close friend of mine
357449,lol this is irreleant
357450,price didnt reach the level of liquidation right
357451,this is ftx saying fck off we took your money and expect you bend over and take it
357452,correct
357453,price topped out under 07 and liquidation was above 09
357454,do you have a screenshot of your position before liquidation aka health entry etc
357455,in my case i had an estimated liquidation price of 17k and the price never went below 20k in the time slot of liquidation
357457,
357459,i might share this either but if you have full proof
357460,notsofast retweeted __security researchers at halbornsecurity have disclosed a wallet vulnerability that affects a small segment of users across many browserbased wallets including metamask1
357462,nan
357463,if anyone would like to show support for the proposal for devcon 7
357465,nan
357466,
357467,wow this fully sucks man im so sorry for this
357468,yeah pretty shitty
357469,whats with all the trading chat here today buy a lobs and post this shit to the guarded room
357470,
357471,what room i have lobs anyway
357472,ngmi
357473,
357474,
357485,give them to me
357486,no they went up in price
357487,for those who were interested the erc4626 research article is out and you can find it here hope you enjoy
357488,curious what steps 3ac from taking a stables flash loan repay their stables loan on aave claiming their eth converting eth back to stables and repay back flashloan they will save north of 40m doing this and aovid headacheliquidation etc
357489,nan
357490,what if they dont have headache lol
357491,super cool to see those numbers we just shipped our 4626 info site yesterday too with repos and contractsvaults down at the bottom no realtime stats though
357492,would be the biggest psyops so far
357493,
357494,even if it was them theyre going to have to return the stables as stables somehow
357495,same same
357496,interesting i was going over some of the contracts on your website and saw that we hadnt discovered this one looks like its because they have a different implementation of the deposit event than whats in the eip document
357497,we are just flagging contract code for mentions of the standard not filtering into deposit events but also means not all things are necessarily vaults some implementations are def wacky
357498,true true very cool website a live dashboard showing erc4626 adoption would definitely be nice
357501,
357502,fuck us in the ass powell
357503,were doing it ourselfs already sir
357504,up only uncle powell
357505,ty
357506,i guess they are just timing rate cut to halving
357507,quite irresponsible how wallets are downplaying the severity of this if anyone ever entered a mnemonic in a browser tab ever recovered your software wallet anon then all derived addresses should be treated as compromised yet another reason to always use a hardware wallet even if its annoying
357508,the tone is not harsh as expected
357509,aaaand trad market is up 200 points on the news
357510,normal behavior this happened with the last two rate hikes the following day it nukes
357511,i knew this would happen and still didnt trade it f
357512,since eqz is rekt until v2 whats cool kids r using rn for cheap gas and fee fls
357514,
357515,so the nansen wrong claims on 3ac wallets were never even tagged
357516,
357517,need a twitter archiver asap
357518,so this whole drama today was just a well made psyops brilliant another day in parad crytodies
357519,not all of it
357520,majority seems to be true they also confirmed it just this particular part
357521,a significant bit the 200k eth aave account was also not 3ac but some asian guy
357522,the narrative of 3ac getting rekt at 1015 eth was false
357523,but it was fun to watch ngl
357524,this once again proves onchain analysis is scam
357525,nope it proves trusting words on twitter is a good way to get scammed
357526,but onchain analysis providers and software literally launched this narrative
357527,muh 3ac on chain liquidations
357528,yeah this is crypto trust no one are you new
357529,because they have 0 revenue they have to keep people paying their useless shit
357530,nope again painting narratives drives the markets your way those who controlled these narratives could make shorts and longs as they pleased and profit thats how this all works even in tradfi
357531,fyi this vote is happening today
357532,if you got cobie new alt dm lol he is good content
357533,pretty sure the point was to shut people out
357534,never got in the first one but maybe bear market i have chance
357535,
357537,thats really cool to see experiments like this and lens from successful crypto companies some thoughts based on announcement without even trying the product
357538,we believe that nansen is a natural fit for a social appi dont how do you get from wallet labels by analytics company to a messenger communities the argument of chatting with people who made similar thing onchain sounds weak to me talk to people who got sandwiched youll get 100s of weak communities while strong communities will live in telegram and discord seen it before in web2 with many social apps and built onemessenger telegram is a great messenger and its extremely hard to make something even close to it discord is great tool for communities it has problems because problems are hard not because the team is weak what new feature or substantial improvment is enabled by blockchain nft apart from wallet based accountsdms we need a way to send occasional onchain dms by a wallet and that can be the main usage of nansen connect if it takes off have to solve spam and prove youre not reading my messages then somehow make people use it being a private company
357539,everyone is trying to go social
357540,social capital efficiency is the hot new buzzword
357541,i dont understand what that means
357542,yeah there is a reason status has been failing to take off for years and there is a reason people do not use fully decentralized web3 chats you outlined pretty good ones there one thing i would say is that most of discords problems are easy they just seem to be run by either children or no one because i promise you that entire company does not have a single qa or ux perso on board
357543,neither do its proponents
357544,sounds hypey though
357545,sounds like chamath
357547,wen soul bound social capital efficiency
357548,soon first we need to fractionalize soul bound tokens create movable derivatives and fill liquidity pools just because it is soul bound doesnt mean we cant sell the shit out of it and then we will use gearbox to leverage our soulbound position and make heavy gainz
357549,just another narrative
357551,
357552,
357553,
357554,id argue etherscans blockscan chat is a very sensible experiment too but yall dont use it
357555,oh so are you the one who sent a message to rotki i see someone has sent a message to rotki but i have never tried to read it
357557,
357559,that looks a bit weird indeed looks like it has to do with this specific kind of offering it appears that the nft was not actually minted on chain before the sale was agreed on probably some kind of lazy minting to save artists money so i get that the buyer pays the minting fee but how does the mev bot get in between take the rest
357560,
357561,i just came here looking for anyone talking about this we just learned about it an hour ago and did some digging nothing conclusive yet but we likewise think its only impacting the opensea shared storefront
357562,has anyone found anything more definitive or been in touch with opensea were waiting on confirmation from them that this can only impacts the shared storefront collection i still havent had the chance to sit down and read through seaport
357563,just saw the foobar tweet lol does anyone have details on the fix
357564,
357566,where can i see the biggestall liquidations on lend platforms like aavecompoundeuler for the last month or so is there a service for that
357567,probably parsec
357568,
357569,anyone know who to contact for bizdev at aave
357572,
357573,
357575,thanks for sharing this fuse hack is really confusing i thought this issue was old news
357576,its a more thoughtful thread cobies seem kinda hateful he literally made one other governance and now dunking on other daos
357579,
357581,pow coins ok but no one wants your janky hpc datacentre web3 protocols cant use your gpu compute it is also useless for stakingoperating validator node
357582,actually zkproof mining seems cool
357583,
357584,first lamda then thisstahp 2022
357585,they can just learn to code
357586,can anyone explain me why mkr disable aave dai deposits
357587,it says it in the description haha
357588,or they can mine ethereum classic as they were destined for
357589,this is unfortunate fei labs took the longest possible time to bring the proposal to a vote after doing everything behind the scenes to torpedo the vote while signaling that they supported reimbursement in their discord feis collateral is also almost all stablecoins meaning they can pay the 30m and still be fully collaterized
357590,no chance as per the data etc pays only 19 of the miners revenuetheyll have to keep double spending on every pow network they can get their hands on for diminishing returns if theyre true profit maximalists
357591,lol it was a joke pretty sure since their 51 attack the eth merge is what keeping that community going
357592,ah sorry been arguing with people who actually believes that
357593,either way if a gpu pow apocalypse does happeni hope itll warp up in the bear market and not drag us down again afterwards
357594,honestly it happens in all bear markets dont think it will be that much worse this time just hopefully the coming bull markets wont ever lead to a gpu price gouging again
357595,that i read sersince its backed by steth no one is ready to liquidate
357599,the aave proposal that this change was to in response to didnt pass but see the comments for further colour on why people voted each way
357609,here
357610,
357611,literally asking for a friend should i consider losses in a crvsteth yearn vault position as impermanent until stetheth recovers to parity or has he essentially been arbed and parity wont make him whole again seemingly a bit of a noobie question but i cant seem to wrap my head around the mechanics of this one
357612,anyone know if theres a script that creates vanity addresses for contracts
357613,after having no success with asking on fb discord
357614,
357615,and
357616,i believe those vaults literally just farm dump crv for you they do not rebalance so its impermanent ye but would defer to banteg for confirmation
357617,crypto is a funny place every time something new arrives and people have valid concerns smart guys say its never gonna happen then the thing goes live and thats exactly what happens concerns about d3m were dismissed because it was this hot stuff to revitalise maker now here we are freezing it
357637,something going on
357638,not the first time for inverse right
357639,dont post txs until people signal funds are safe
357640,not safu
357641,doesnt the fact the guy already sent half the eth to tornado makes them not safe
357642,hi banteg im curious at the reasoning behind this comment why shouldnt someone post txs even if the funds arent safe
357643,because you tip off copycats
357644,i see what you mean
357645,until the rest of the funds are safe
357646,as long as funds are still at risk its better to not post too much info and make it easier for more copycats who realize the exploit to also attack
357647,has anyone used this device is it betterworse than purism
357648,do we have any more inf on this eg is there something actionable
357649,1 device in israeli prisons
357650,hope they sell enough to hire a dev to replace that lorem ipsum description
357651,it is a scam and its creators either are or were already prosecured
357652,the sirin shitcoin creators who also had other rugs
357653,they raised like 100m in the ico bubble i doubt they need to sell a single phone
357654,
357655,moshe hogeg scam
357656,hogeg was arrested in november 2021 over alleged sexcrimes cryptocurrencyrelated fraud and released on 22 million bail hogeg is currently under suspicion of a number of sex crimes including childtrafficking and underage prostitution offenses beitar jerusalem fc hogeg was relatively unknown in israeli football before he acquired beitar
357657,people cant help themselves into wanting to squeeze every last drop of capital efficiency out of the system that often involves exploring either direct or indirect implementation of fractional reserves or leverage both of which can rekt a protocol extremely quickly in markets this volatile
357659,what would happen if all leverage was forbidden on exchanges
357660,would volatility decrease
357661,
357662,perpetual protocol would go to the moon
357664,i like how they explain the blockchain lol
357665,why are so many crypto projects not building responsive uis so the mobil experience is not terrible
357666,hi guys does anyone have an eth cc ticket for sale by any chance
357667,i think its partly that the mobile wallet experience is frequently so bad that people tend to go desktop first
357669,we live on our phones a good mobil experience shouldnt just be a nicetohave but a must have
357670,youre right that mobil wallet experience is abysmal
357671,honestly building crypto apps on apple is a nightmare because they have no idea how to handle crypto
357672,but a responsive application cant be too much to ask

357690,hey is there any open source nft minting bot for eth or solana
357691,i really wish people would google stuff moresolana
357696,not necessarily the case
357697,isnt this potentially an easy stuff to use to ddos the chain
357699,lmao hilarious code
357700,social media and twitter in general has been a socially powered search engine
357709,either gib facts or del
357710,otherwise not constructive
357711,people shilling perp alternatives that run centralised oracles yeaaaaaaaa
357712,speakin of oracles which protocol is your tweet in reference to regarding curve v2 pools as cdp oracles and what is your thoughts on abras tricrypto2 cdp
357713,this is to avoid front running mask price sources prevent market manipulation and resist censorshipan opaque geographically distributed service like the don is much harder to take down than a weakly decentralized oracle if youre going to design an oracle that claims to be decentralized it needs to be sufficiently decentralized at ethereum or bitcoin scale to deliver meaningful censorship resistance otherwise its just decentralization theater
357714,abra folks use the one that we think is the best right now
357715,inverse they were using spot balances multiplied by chainlink prices which is not recommended unfortunate situation but the current best solution already exists
357716,im wondering does tellor fit that discription

357728,finblox pauses withdrawals due to 3ac exposure
357729,havent dug in yet first instinct is that the hacker didnt use flashbots or other tricks and a generalized frontrunning bot picked up that it could do it first and frontran the hacker
357730,is there a good 1 min chart for eth base fees somewhere
357734,

357790,
357791,are there any 3ac portcos here that can confirm they did in fact manage the treasuries of the protocols they invested this is troubling
357793,yes can confirm they put this offer to their portcos im ryan matovu founder of ardana here after investment they asked to both market make and manage our treasury we said no to both
357794,maybe better question is who didnt do it
357795,projects that did probably cant say
357796,was possible in tradfi bill hwang did it
357797,fuck this is bad to hear
357798,oh shit wasnt aware of those specifics
357799,what are the chances they invested the treasuries into other seed rounds to get access to more treasuries i mean this is speculative but this thing might turn out to be a decent ponzi no wonder they were so bullish on the luna ponzi
357800,promise projects 8 while getting 20 on anchor
357801,oo
357802,this would be hilarious
357803,investception
357804,i still dont understand how this happens your managing billions just arb the curve sit back and collect management fees who do you need to flex on who do you need to prove something to
357805,whole thing is so insane to think about
357806,where is the incentive to just leverage up this much
357807,ego greed thats it
357808,god complex
357809,social media stardom billions like smoking crack
357810,it is literally impossible to cash out 8 let alone 9 figs
357811,sometimes you drink your own kool aid
357812,zhuper cycle brosnot like this
357813,so u can buy all 250b worth of eth
357815,whats the incentive to provide so much leverage to begin with its like a patron who is too drunk but the bartender keeps topping him up unless there was some misappropriation of funds someone was their creditor and they are as much at fault here for not doing due diligence or inspecting actions of the debtor more closely the use of funds in leverage was as i understand it not only clearly stated and understood by all parties and even casual observers on twitter but also verifiable onchain its crypto after allthe creditors should know the risks given volatility and be able to verify it onchain even in specific cases its not like massive exposure to luna was a secret you could just as easily blame the creditors for their proxy greed and enabling this whole thing to begin with every trade has two parties
357816,sure and agree with most of what you said i just think most assumed they had a decent grasp on risk and not just slinging deltas on leverage
357817,i think it is precisely that assumption made by creditors given their reputation and status in the space that caused this unfortunately may be an accurate description of their own evaluation of their own risk as well but who am i to speculate on a whales risk assessment ive fumbled plenty of bags myself
357818,trustworthy and legitimate 3ac comes to you and asks for unsecured leverage do you say no
357819,yes
357820,i say gfo play with your own money
357821,
357822,both su and kyle publicly mentionned using numerology to size positions and that wins shall be big and losses as well
357823,nexo is credissimo so they said no but they are literally serious company not a bunch of kids that incorporated overnight and all of a sudden they are playing with sticks in sand
357824,were all degens made of the same wood at the end of the day
357825,you dont make that kind of money using traditional boomer risk management in the first place
357826,you mean the people behind zeus capital
357827,much serious very adult wow
357828,
357829,i was going to post that lol
357830,that is so fucked up man like a proper fucking company doing such stuff
357831,how much free time do you have
357833,the fuck is numerology
357835,he doesnt know
357836,woo network has some part of their treasury with three arrows also qcp is heavily involved with 3ac wonder if its any contagion risk there
357837,fwiw arthur from defiance is liking ton of anti3ac posts idk if he was under their umbrella or what but seems like theres more to the story here and well deal with blowbacks from this deep into the summer
357838,wen yearn treasury management
357839,i think 3 arrows were the largest investors in defiance
357840,defiance was basically 3ac venture arm
357841,so they go to grave with them
357842,nah
357843,they just used the same legal entity but operated independently
357844,wait zhu su still has defiance in his bio lol
357845,used the same legal entity operated independently idk lol
357846,point is they were pretty tightly coupled
357847,are you sure about that ive seen arthur talk about needing zhu sus approval for certain investments
357848,if its the same legal entity arent they rekt too
357849,that would explain the tweets
357850,yep heard on some pod seems like a multisig with control by 3ac and defiance arthur was essentially getting some carry not sure how exactly it is structured but by his tweets seems to me they are not together anymore
357851,these guys really had every projects treasury in anchor huh
357852,hahahahahaha
357853,
357854,3ac redeemed their funds from defiance a few months ago i believe actually
357855,so so sad
357856,now someone is going to say that they control every bridge multisig too and sold those keys and put the keys as collateral and levered up with bridge money or something
357857,and i will believe it
357858,funny enough this pops up again back in 2011 ive seen lots of companies offering some sort of intercepting devices for sea cables with capacity processing between 40100gbit back then usually national traffic of small countries back then
357859,
357860,
357861,i guess i said nothing wierd
357862,this is what i did perfect strategy
357863,5 whale maker holdersthe admission juuust past 21050 is even more interesting lol
357864,yeah
357865,posted below
357866,there has been an strategic meeting between me and the whales they dont really care they are not willing to take any kind of action no one is
357867,im lmaoing so hard at runes response to the comments of makerman
357868,its so funny that when makerman says there is 1416 million dai sitting on core units multisigs then rune adds to the list of objectives claw back excess cash from core units
357869,jfc daos and daos voting are failing hard talking in yfi secret admirers about that also
357870,literally no one gives a fuck about the core issues maker is having rn
357871,like i said again
357874,source
357875,
357876,lily from woo here we dont have any financial exposure to 3ac outside of they are our backer
357877,does staking exists on stablecoins or its only lending to get a yield
357878,this is really good to know tbh
357880,
357881,love the pepe pic
357883,
357884,great thread
357885,in summary
357886,nan
357888,well hate it or love it if the 3ac downfall happens regulations are coming onchain transparency does shit if theres no incentives negative or positive to protect the health of the industry
357889,they came long ago why do you think uniswap frontend snitches on you
357890,tell me moar ser
357891,you are mistaken tho that regulators are in to protect the little guy so far ive only seen people protected from the airdrops and all the companies which beg for clear rules but only getting bullied in response
357892,uniswap sends all txs you send here
357893,will never forget when they protected me from dydx airdrop worth an average americans 1y salary rip my sanity
357894,safe and protected ser
357895,they are not here to protect the little guys for sure just saying that this will give them valid reasons to establish watchdogs
357896,ew gross presumably with some pii attached even worse
357897,youll be so protected itll be like you never left the stock market
357898,is there an event group for nftnyc
357899,remember how companies like props tried to comply but got shut down instead you cant work with regulators if they are showing a malicious behavior
357900,they should be just a part of threat modeling and people should be aware their only goal is squashing the industry and giving whats left back to gatekeepers
357902,time to frontrun it with protec dao you take a test and if you fail you get rerouted to ameritrade and frens the protectors get what they want the needprotection get safe and regulated
357904,
357907,genesis has stopped withdrawal i hope they are good however
357908,lobs is it a good idea to launch a product like prediction market in this marketany thoughts wud be appreciated
357909,you are launching products in this market
357910,feel free to launch product but no token there are lot many prediction market already
357911,issue is really what you do differently with your prediction market product there have been truly many such things and i believe the closest one that got to the sun was polymarket one of the strats seemed to be to activate its angels and investors super hard and do a few predictions on the most edgy topics back then it was us elections
357912,didnt gnosis start as a prediction market
357913,heres an interesting thread on the story of two young indian brothers who founded instadapp
357914,i agree with this and you need only evaluate peoples actions instead of their words if the sec for example wanted to fight fraud in crypto it would not be easier and they could do it quickly and efficiently that is not their goal judging by their actions and how they spend their resources despite whatever they claim when they jawbone their job is to protect incumbents if i had speculate based on track record
357915,sources
357916,is it a very bad idea ser
357917,in my experience regulators are typically in it for power optics and relevence which then leads to more funding either through government or a levy they push onto industry tend to agree that the only way they can do this effectively is try and centralise because it becomes easier to collect the money and enforce their code of conductfew other observations by the time they are publishing research and discussion papers they have most likely decided what they will do and even if everyone pushes back they will typically ignore it when they first float new code and guidance for discussion it will almost always be overkill because they need the optics of listening and pulling it back in newer industries they will almost always go after the fastest car on the road and not number 2 or 3 unless fastest car is especially hard to pin down almost every regulator is 3 years behind the technology they regulate when it comes to crypto in my opinion they will and have started with onoff ramp the next most obvious place will be centralisation of node operators and staking if you can own the pos networks through a few big eth stakers coinbase etc you control the validation decisions like which client do you pick etc and also can regulate block ordering in a lot of casesthey would then control both the on ramp for customers and the transaction settlement layer leading to more enforcable regulation
357918,its not
357919,user reported
357920,thats one tweet
357921,and the thread isnt even sure whether its about gemini or genesis
357922,with user reports saying that they have been able to get funds out in the same thread
357923,gemini earn funds are lent out thru genesis fwiw i withdrew 6figs gusd start of the week and it took 2 days to go thru im guessing geminis liquidity reserves for instant withdrawals have probably dried up and they have to actually call back loans now according to loan agreement borrowers have up to 5 business days to return funds
357924,hi everyone i hope you are doing welli have a problem im writing to ask for your help regarding a crypto scam of more than 3000 usdt which after investigation landed on binance im asking for your help to know the procedure to get my money back or to have the identity because of kyc since its a centralized exchange
357925,sure something to be careful about anyway i had funds anywhere right now i would be withdrawing them
357926,be careful with shady centralised exchanges they will most likely default in a bear market
357927,bro parsec been around for ages
357928,my man gets it
357929,just use sushiswap built in mev protection and no geoip restrictions
357930,
357931,anyone got good tldr on this
357932,precaution
357933,whats the problem here tho the data is public isnt it
357935,ok no more opportunistic supply of makers dai into aave
357936,
357937,does anyone have any data on the breakdown between mobile desktop for crypto users
357938,
357939,curve wars ended
357940,the link between your ip addr browser fingerprint and tx no
357941,ah thats bad
357942,who won
357943,all died
357944,the undertaker
357945,only the dead have seen the end of war convex most probably
357948,so currently they sold the bottom lol
357949,cocktower always sell bottoms
357950,well they saw this latest nuke coming early and got out of btrfly in time tbh
357953,at what price
357954,like 120 they were selling
357956,which felt low
357957,but err
357958,90 down since then
357960,thought some of you might be interested in what i found about usddtrx
357961,so the discrepancy between the bridge contract balance and balance on other chains its minted out of thin air
357962,yes in the past i noticed it was up to 10m at that time it was only sitting in the bridge contract and it might be like that now too but the point is this shouldnt be possible at all imo
357963,nan
357964,was checking nansen lobs nft mcap lacoste nft mcap rightly so
357965,
357966,you cant quantify or compare the value of lobsters
357967,
357968,is there a confirmed rektnot rekt listdashboard for vchedgiesetc
357969,massive lending from 3ac afaik many funds from asia got rekt with them too
357970,
357971,well thats just rumors and ct accounts hoping to collect clout in a couple of months
357972,i mean regarding the details
357976,babel finance large asian lending desk said to be facing unusual liquidity pressures and decided to temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals
357979,too many msgs if everyone tried to do hr here you can try that in amplice how about some way where we can do biweekly list of open candidate roles wdyt maybe the website can compile them
357980,what do people think about feels like web3 skeptics having a field day atm
357981,anyone worried for ledn and their genesis exposition
357982,
357983,last i checked funding rate was insane still true
357984,i guess if you got a strat like macd or something working 5050 this could definitely be worth
357985,i mean marcs response was weak
357986,i meant more for better responses on the topic
357987,every friday celsius ceo alex mashinsky streams live on youtube to share market insights company updates life lessons and more with our community170 weekly episodes and were not stopping now join us this friday at 100pm et to askmashinskyanythingshould be fun today
357988,anyone from etherscan here
357989,only if urgent tho harith
357990,best web3 product arent going to replicate web2 imo if people frame argument for web3 from strengths of web2 youll come up short most of the time
357991,
357992,
357993,
357994,is there a full interview somewhere else theyre referring to or is that all they got from them
357995,also all the numbers that were floating around like 18 bln were they wrong and the real number is 3
357996,why is nobody else talking about the timeline for zk polygon
357997,sasha52653 pinging you as i see you are a member of this group as well perhaps youll decide to respond herefor those who dont know heres a short summary sasha ivanov is the founder of waves vires finance is the equivalent of aave on waves for some time now sasha has accused malicious actors sbf for attacking their stablecoin peg usdn neutrino usd not proved yet due to this alleged attack all usdc usdt lenders on vires finance have their funds locked unable to withdraw because borrowers have snatched their liquidity by depositing usdn as collateral long story short sasha has acquired the whales debt positions himself with a proposal that was voted in favor he now controls most if not all of vires finance debt positions hundreds of millions of worth lenders are now waiting for him to unwrapliquidate debt positions convert usdn to usdt usdc so they can withdraw their funds both sasha vires finance tg admins keep saying that will happen soon but its already been few weeks and they arent bringing anything new on the table lenders are beginning to lose patience and are worried they will lose their lent assetsthere is much more to this story and other fellow lobster members can perhaps explain it better than i did most importantly i advise everyone to do their own due dilligence waves seems not to be a true decentralized project waves exchange itself isnt truly trustless and permissionless many reports of withdrawal delays lately
357998,classic
357999,thanks for raising this upconcerns are real and all hes doing is posting meme on twitter
358000,
358001,
358002,he will be next after do kwon
358003,ser michwill arent they pretty much fking curve depositors this way i know this is all permissionless but doesnt this prompt some emergency to block a gauge
358004,so gauge culling happens indeed anyone can propose a cull on governance with enough proof reasoning why it should happen and then its an onchain vote there have been active voices in the community that have tried to dissuade voters against voting for specific gauges eg usdoubled
358005,but not dire enough to warrant an emergency dao intervention like mochi
358006,
358007,im worried about the other protocols that let them manage their treasury
358008,the sadness of this story is that usdn has only 19 collateral now depositing to the curve pool means instant exit liquidity for such undercollateralised algostablecoinusers of curve definitely must be warned about such risks
358009,anyone is free to make such proposal
358010,btw what does dn stand for in usdn hmmm
358012,usd neutrino
358013,deeezzzz nutzzzzz
358014,a quick question is bitfinex kyc mandatory
358015,who is he
358016,yes
358018,a genius quant
358019,any heads up for non kyc exchange which supports margin trading
358020,gmx onchain
358021,bybit
358022,genius the one that blown his fund away betting like su zhu
358025,welp not always
358026,he bet on 6k to hold back in a days when we nuked to 3k after during black swan liquidated entire fund
358027,you dont need to be genius for that
358028,yeah i can do that as well
358029,smart people fail all the time anyway a trader w some experience maybe a builder moving on
358030,tradfi smart defi dumb
358031,like me
358032,full of ta nevermind they tradfi dumb
358033,not all he returned the rest of capital to his investors
358034,whats the best source to fetch erc20 crypto logos from
358035,you can try trustwallets assets repo and maybe githubcomethereumliststokens
358036,or coingecko their free api should be good
358038,genius for returning the capital or for gambling away on leverage using some bullshit on chain analysis and wyckoff meme patterns
358039,why do you even need leverage for fund while you have huge capital to return huge profits during bull market
358040,bro his fund worked in bear market how to get big profit without leverage
358041,sit on cash lol
358042,and he invented on chain analysis new thing for crypto traders
358043,it is enough for calling him genius
358044,sers this stuff ok for kingdom here kinda investingtrading we dont do buy the shit nft and join the pinned invite link fin
358045,yes its possible
358046,sasha went online in the vires finance group today directed him to lobsters group because he is a member here and this was his only response
358047,lmao
358048,loooooool
358049,what did you expect haha
358050,based
358051,dangerously based
358052,never thought he was a scammer waves r super smart devs and have just been maybe unlucy with their strat only respect for them really they built kinda unique and cool stuff used to know a few of them but their usdn journey is not really on par w their previous work when they tried to actually create something idk
358053,this is actually reassuring a bit coming from you ive been involved in all this drama because i was stoopid and didnt dyor i saw big apr i pressed deposithopefully we can all have a good ending to all of this soon
358054,i think this situation is tough for them idk all ins and outs they got involved in a dangerous stablecoin game and its hard to get out of it i assume
358055,will just discount his behavior to stress tbh he isnt an arrogant person afaik just tough times and tough market
358056,they pump dumped waves by minting close to a billion usdn and borrowing aggressively against it it has resulted in a liquidity rush on vires and people unable to withdraw their stables 500m in total the usdn situation is totally their own fault
358057,maybe plausible deniability it was not them but i would assume someone close enough
358058,the wallets that did the pd have been linked to sasha if it was not him it was his twin brother btw he confiscated these wallets a few weeks ago
358059,he might look like a friendly guy and he is probably a good dev but what they did here was criminal
358060,only him or waves team could have access to like 60 of the usdn in circulation to back the loan
358061,90 ltv on usdn on vires with usdn hard coded at 1
358062,soooooo where do the people that deposited money into this thing expecting to profit directly leading to its growth but want their money back now things are uncomfortable stand
358063,does anyone have a direct contact with the snapshot team
358064,so it looks all normal to your that the founder of the project used 600m of its own minted stablecoin to borrow 600m of usdtusdc
358065,anyone could have done this they didnt start the loop with 60 of usdn they minted it along the way but yes the wallets are probably of someone close to team or team i havent found any malicious acts though it seemed to be aimed at jump starting the ecosystem instead of profiting of it
358066,you didnt realize that before you deposited money in expecting to profit
358067,he had no problem to expose the owner of a certain waves address alameda but somehow hes having issues exposing this
358068,your question is not helping go ask this to the lunaust users
358069,i did
358070,they had the same excuses
358071,when kwon got secd a year or so ago they were all crying about sec bad regulators scammers
358072,now theyre begging for the sec to rekt kwon and bail them out because checks notes they lost money buying into the thing they were praising as pristine barely 24 hrs earlier
358073,i am not trying to protect yieldseekers or users per se they should dd i was talking in context of protocols themselves and whether other integratorsprotocols should be involved with such i am not saying they should not though that was the topic
358074,defending protocol to protocol work is more on par w lets think for each other because otherwise systemic risks can increase
358075,if you dont have full disk encryption you have no excuse now
358076,this is a separate security warning than the one posted months ago similar attack surface
358077,does it decrease os performance
358078,everything has risks if youre holding usdt or usdc youre at risk as well
358079,not significant on majority of modern last 10 years computers since those have hardware aes acceleration
358080,nathan_vdh
358081,for instance on windows bitlocker can leverage eg aesni on most modern intel cpus and even barring that some ssds and hdds have builtin encryption though not without flaws
358082,legend thank you
358083,few people have a strong enough character to own their mistakes
358084,this is only true for mm hot wallet not if you connected with ledger through mm right
358086,not related to ledger correct
358087,thanks
358088,its related to the mneomonic secret phrase ideally you will not have typed your ledger mnemonic secret phrase into mm
358089,binance suspended withdrawals without prior notice at least for me anyone else
358090,check your vpn isnt set to a suspended jurisdiction it sometimes connects to ontario for me and i cant withdraw switch to somewhere else and it works again
358092,and reveal it on screen specifically instead of black dots
358093,thats normally how that interface works
358094,if its a password field with a reveal buttoncheckbox then its treated like a password field even if you reveal it
358095,but since they made it a plain text box its subject to this issue
358096,this is exactly why i moved away from metamask browser security models are not aligned with the security model that should make you comfortable storing bearer bonds
358097,even if you still use a hot wallet instead of a ledger or we dont store your keys in a browser extension this seems obvious to me but people love to store 6 figures of value in metamask hot wallets
358098,ah i wasnt responding to anything to anything you said in particular and i agree with the protocolprotocol stuffjust saying its a bit rich to see certain people who deposited money in stuff complaining about its properties that existed before they deposited
358099,
358100,mfka
358101,thats their second wallet fireworks around the first wallet seems done for now
358102,btw is not 3ac it was previously mislabelled dunno who it is
358103,both wallets are labeled as cai wensheng
358104,wasnt it a chinese vc
358105,longling capital or something like that
358106,yeah this is not 3ac
358107,
358108,damn they dumping that shit hard
358109,why price not falling make it fall
358110,easier to dump onchain as there is way more capital waiting on the sidelines and using oracles to rebalance
358111,this channel got better and better last few days btw celsius 3ac cai wensheng etc
358112,
358113,lmao they use mid 2020 data to format their announcement
358114,etherscan removed the unconventional ordering flag
358115,still there eg interested to hear your thoughts on biss hit piece too
358116,its a very clear scam and i and others have published extensive documentation of it
358117,500m was stolen
358120,any thoughts on optimism 2nd airdrop when and how much
358121,weird that this tx wasnt tagged as unconventional ordering
358122,funds of people using leverage funds being stolen
358123,damn
358124,he blamed it on unidentified whales abusing the system but his account is linked directly to those on chain
358125,yephe disclosed alamedas wallet with no problem but never disclosed whos behind the others dirty games
358126,they use mev explore as the source of truth which still reports wrong data on high value txs
358127,design reviewplease dont be quick to judge me hahai have an nft collection a in which i can only set the uri of a token once before its finalized but i need to be able to change it many times i can point all the uris to a centalized server in order to fix this but i want a more decentralized way so my solution for this is to depoly another contract b that will manage the uris and point the uris in a to endpoint the looks like this ethgetiocall0x11932123123contractaaddr0x12geturifuncaddrunint256unit2561just like some nft collections point to ipfsioifps0x instead of ipfs hoping that one day this becomes a standardwhat do you guys think
358128,this tx is tagged as 28m profit while the actual profit is 80 eth of which 745 eth was paid to the miner
358129,same goes for smaller txs like this one which executes a multipath mev extraction which ends up with a profit of 00335549544 eth of which 00219 eth is paid to the miner
358130,if you trust the data without verifying it to make fud articles then the outcome ends up being shitty phantom articles research papers
358131,tbf flashbots does its job on disclosing these issues with mevexplore but at the end of the day its the job of the analysts to perform this fact check
358132,
358134,nan
358135,
358137,is this similar to pyth but with decentralized pools
358138,tldr yes
358139,didnt read pyth but this at least is a smart contract that makes it easier to use uniswap v3 twaps
358140,offloading some of the tech burden and trying people not to re invent the wheel when its fairly simple and straight forward
358141,cool is there like a uh breakdown of the gas costs
358142,
358143,not sure if its possible as it would be really biased it depends on how many pools you want to take into account and how long is the twap that you want
358145,wtf do the sec want with rari
358146,kids going to jail hopefully only a young offenders institute
358147,that email looks so fake ngl
358148,showcheck header
358150,hit that 3 dots and click view source might be view original
358152,then have a look at the spf dkim and dmarc
358153,thats not conclusive proof for it being real
358155,dogetoshi r u working yet
358156,there we go much harder to spoof dmarc
358157,nan
358158,are we getting ganged on again
358159,check full header
358160,so assuming the email is real what is this about what does your trading on coinbase have to do with rari capital are they just forwarding data of all rgt trades
358161,would you mind forwarding this email to the block or is it too personal
358162,
358163,this also depends on the bps as you know
358166,
358167,
358168,new market conditions require new indicators going 100x long now
358169,can i add this indicator in tradingview
358170,you could say its a private script
358173,that is disgusting where is the chart with timestamps and exact numbers so we could ta sentiment
358175,
358176,nan
358177,mister i cash out 7 figures per week via bitfinex which my buddy paolo is running has kyc issues
358178,pos
358179,is there anybody from blockfi team or anyone can connect me with them
358182,lobster frens who is gonna be at nft nyc
358183,
358184,hay im makin onboardingproduction company web3 analysisfund wild collab projects holla
358185,why dont you just not finalize it or maybe remove the finalization functionality what if this ethgetio thing dies if you really want to use a second contract to handle the uris instead of just changing the uris in contract a why not have it make a call to the other contract for the tokenuri instead pointing to ipfsio is bad youre hardcoding in a specific ipfs gateway instead of just telling people that its an ipfs hash and they can pull the file however they like
358186,dont think passing dmarc necessarily indicates much that depends on the policy set by coinbasedkim though yes
358187,yea for sure
358188,can anyone recommend what projects to follow for a composer who writes scores for movies trying to expand my work portfolio
358189,
358190,mim is an over colla algo stable why people are so panic
358191,ust ptsd
358192,because while that is the case maybe its time to stop trusting sneasels
358193,gearbox fixes this too
358194,not sure if this kinda thing is of interest but grammy winning classicaledm musician bt has been creating generative music released as nfts heres a 24hr av music performance as a nft on arweave and a few weeks ago the orbs project on the orbs project is a collection of 3333 live coded realtime playingobjects terrains skies and stars that react to an ongoing and ever changing musical creation
358195,i cant change a its already deployed
358196,its the best solution i can think of
358197,crazy to think that people wouldnt be using fde especially when using crypto
358198,actually the trade was not stupid
358199,my hope is that ethgetio could turn into a eth standard just like ipfs did but maybe its just wishful thinking
358200,the ipfs uri scheme ipfs the ipfsio gateway dont conflate the two
358201,if you use the ipfsio gateway in your nft uris and they decide to shut down the ipfsio gateway one day youre gonna end up with a bunch of dead links
358202,tbf its up to clients to resolve both the ipfs prefix or the gateway
358203,given that the gateway had the hash its trivial to redirect it if needed
358204,exactly
358205,ipfsio was prob a solution before os started to support its
358206,so what im wondering is would we ever need eth and how would a url like
358207,and its gone
358208,lol
358209,refund
358210,im looking for the queue for refunds too am i in the right place
358211,yes how may i waste your time today
358212,
358213,more to go im assuming
358214,nan
358215,they did what they asked for
358216,so what now
358217,whats the way to get out of this
358218,couple weeks ago
358219,doesnt such a price already allow for profitable redemptions
358220,too late
358221,nothing it was fud i think
358222,i read the thread not per se fud more like u aka uncertainty given the constant weird behavior by dani
358223,yeah unless those users dont have the to pay back their loans
358224,flashloan
358225,curve allows flashloan
358226,no
358227,f
358228,50 of the supply of mim is stuck at curve
358229,there is no other avenue for it
358230,can flashloan from univ3 only 1m tvl
358231,ah wait bentobox
358232,or thats the mim issuance box
358233,yeah it seems to be the mim issuance box
358234,but yeah it works for flash loan its technically nonissued mim tho
358235,
358236,rebanked
358237,what a dumb article defi is opaque because celsius and luna blew up which are not defi
358240,yeah man aave created a base and they are blowing it up instead of upgrading
358244,correct
358247,firstmargincall too much blabla and random stuff redacted please dont do that or admins will be forced to mute
358248,nan
358253,plz stop posting charts and fear index
358254,those sentiment charts really are peak garbage
358257,any univ3 twaps expert here because i dont see how this is useful for any actively traded token since all the oracles call pools implementation which hits this lineand basically if there has been a swap 10 seconds ago but you need to get an even a quite small 200 seconds twap you have to wait until 190 seconds pass if the pair is actively traded your calls would always revert so you cant use this in your smart contracts to get price on chain at any given time
358258,thats one way to peg a stablecoin i suppose
358259,with liquity liquidating rekt troves and demand for ethleverage drying up what are the consequencesi am dumb so i forget what the dai playbook was it must be similar so far it has been liquidate make for stability pool more liquidations lusd goes up in price as there is lack of it and its needed to close positions no new troves popping up system is shrinking how to get out of the downwards spiral1 is it anyhow becoming unsafe for depositors and lusd itself as it shrinks or no2 is the only way is to wait for new organic demand or for minting fee of 05 being less than the market price of lusd aka it must be 105 to gib riskfree
358261,why does lusd needs to be 105 to be considered risk free
358262,i meant a riskfree trade because there is 05 entry fee and there is nowhere else to get it and gib liquidity you need to wait for lusd price to be at 105
358263,inbetween both new entrants are not willing to get in and the old ones need more dollarcost to repay or is this wrong
358264,i havent seen mentionedmim depegged a couple of hours ago it seems to be getting back to 1 but its an other piece of the puzzle folks should keep an eye on
358265,its twitter bullshit not a single borrow loan overcollaterized stablecoin failed by this moment by itself mims bad debt isnt that huge
358266,nembal convo here
358267,maybe i took it too literally but i believe that as long as lusd is greater than 1005 it would be considered riskfree inbetween both new entrants are not willing to get in and the old ones need more dollarcost to repay or is this wrongthis seems right as well new entrants are needed to arb the price difference from minting similar to rai
358268,is there a spiral looks like a normal shrinking
358269,a spiral meaning no one wants to enter nothing negative system is very well overcoll
358270,theres a memory slot that stores the latest ticks at contract deployment it can store only 1 tick the latest but if some user decides to spend some gas it can make the storage longer and store older data
358271,see increasecardinalitynext
358272,troves and supply reduction by almost 50 last week while cr above 190 safety reserve seems healthy tasty apr generally seems ok ish i think there can be new entrants going lowers as ppl move from vaults to troves
358273,wait is it 1005 or 105 i believe is 105
358274,1 05 is 0005 but fee rate is var from 05 to 5 according to docsexample given by liquityfor example the borrowing fee stands at 05 and the borrower wants to receive 4000 lusd to their wallet being charged a borrowing fee of 2000 lusdbut theres also a 200 lusd for liquidation reserve charge to consider
358275,i assume lusd is a dai clone if such u could do degenerate pvp area of denial shit by buying and not putting into stab pool
358276,usually the fee doesnt get removed from actual supply its held away from circ supply until they turn on accrual and its given out to gov token stakers eventually
358277,uh theres no governance in liquity
358278,this will cause overall ltv collateral ratio to drop if stab pool doesnt have enough so every other vault pays for liquidation
358279,hmm then thats interesting it means there is a tiny 05 of missing supply
358280,liquity is not a dai clone
358281,ok time to go take a look at it
358282,
358283,1 year old tiktok they have made 50 back if not more already
358286,
358287,you can get 48 yield on usdc rn if youre feeling brave and bullish on sol
358288,rn there is 128mm loaned 123mm borrowed and loans are falling usdc
358289,liquidation price
358290,errr i dont know how bullish im feeling on any asset rn
358291,sol at 2227
358292,
358293,tldr theres not enough liquidity to liquidate him without breaking shit
358294,break dot solana dot com
358296,how do you understand things like this can i ask for an explanation
358297,thanks for the info im interested in creating music for some projects like p2e games etc so not just music nft which has a little usage im already in touch with some guys however i decided to ask here as well thanks again
358298,posted in this thread by the founder of solend
358299,like liquidation and loans and borrowing i dont really get it
358302,
358303,in order to fill the liquidation they have to buy from dex but that would crash price lower than could fill out paying the loan
358304,which in most cases they mint more solend but if theres not enouhg buyers of solend to fill it out then theres no money
358305,google stuff read stuffask more indepth details in the chat
358306,thanks a lot its much more clear now
358308,loans now borrows not sure if lenders can withdraw anymore
358309,contact the whale
358310,vyper devz is there any website yt playlist book that you send young padawans to learn basics
358311,i mean hes faced w blowup of his protocol im sure hes trying anything he can
358312,time to turn off the database blockchain
358313,i know my last post on bnt was deleted because it was labeled as fud but are we not allowed to talk the truth even if it does generate fud we should at least be able to debate this this could be a luna situation that i dont think people are realizing
358314,capped ramp2
358315,while i dont care much either way for bancor the storytelling in there makes it pretty clear you dont understand how its proposed to work
358316,did you see the etherscan links posted in there people are withdrawing less than the single asset they provided and given the rest in bnt that happens when bnt drops against their asset if youre that lp isnt your incentive to sell the bnt immediately
358317,jus sayin wat if obvious tin happen they not consider i not fuddi mean its right in here which you were sent the last time but clearly didnt read
358318,if you want to argue whether its sufficient thats a different question but pretending they didnt consider it at all is dubious
358319,no need for hostility this is just a debate what about the governance post convinced you that this death spiral is impossible i might be missing something but the external impermanent loss protection part which allows for whitelisting tokens doesnt solve the problem that bnt might dip it protects bnt but that doesnt protect the lps singlesided stake from the bnt
358320,meh you can talk about debating when you stop being clearly intellectually dishonest
358321,ill give some examples one guy puts in 851 eth and got back 521 eth and 1m bnt he then immediately dumped the bnt for eth eth is a whitelisted asset but the issue isnt that the lps token has to be quality its that bnt is not trusted as a quality asset im not seeing how this is being intellectually dishonest its actually happening now
358322,does anyone have a good resource for understanding longshorts for the crypto market especially derivatives was seeing some posts that the amount of long positions right now are essentially collateral for even bigger short positions and i am just trying to wrap my head around that
358323,have you listened to this
358324,
358325,liquidation risk of comp
358326,jfc people still dont get that bancors il protections is a pool 2 rebrand
358327,nan
358328,851 eth in 521 477 eth out
358329,cool now do all of bancors tvl that is being protected
358330,bnt is only compensated for il why would everything pulled out
358331,the total supply keeps dropping due to burning mechanism also
358332,btw i am not a representative of bancor and i highly suggest to ask more technical qs here
358333,siri put in 1m in ethi get back half eth and half bnt if i sell my bnt back to eth i get slippedhow is that 100 il protection it works if you put in 1k sure above that you will get slipped
358334,but if more people pulls out their liq and more bnt gets printed to compensate their il which they dump instantly leading to falling price of bnt shrinking liquidity inflation which convinces more people to pull out of bancor wont that be a death spiral
358335,that is not how it works if you put in 1 m eth you get back 1 m eth il in bnt
358336,at least thats how it worked for me
358337,works fine on small amounts not on big ones
358338,ok ill have to ask that in the bancor tg
358339,millionaires have problems also it seems
358340,i dont believe there is a way out of ilits all hope for a miracle
358341,the only way accept the risks accociated with providing liquidity
358343,exactly
358344,well somebody has to bear the cost of il
358345,riskreward is the name of the game
358346,i doubt you will get an honest explanation there
358347,ive tried to address it here many timesyet this hope for we can avoid the risks and still benefit from rewards was and im afraid still is present
358348,if the il protection is based on a onchain mechanism it should be verifiable
358349,so to clarify with larger bags the problem is the shallow liquidity and sell pressure when you have to sell the bnts during the exit which in turn can create death spiral
358350,just look at address getting out of pools and the amount mismatches after the bnt sell
358351,i keep finding v21 but not the v3 exits do you have any tx url
358353,i do not understand this constant talk about il protection what is so hard about getting the algorithmmath behind it so you can see where the cost is hidden
358354,there is always a lot of talk about those things but 0 substance it should be sortable in like 10 minutes its either a zero sum game of shifting the il to someone else andor a ponzi
358355,kinda similar to how ohm where everything is fine until someone starts pulling big amount out of the system ok not similar but the problem is amplified when transacted in big amounts
358356,33 is up only until it isnt but theoretically ohm is supposed to have a floor backed by its treasury and protocol owned liquidity shouldnt cause drop to 0
358357,ohm didnt have floor backing mechanism back in the days though with inverse bonds they now have it
358358,best dashboard for monitoring those
358359,that is lacking burning though
358360,yes doesnt include all info for calculating circulating supply changes messari is accurate for tracking that afaik
358361,look at it now
358362,yeah but the total supply is decreasing
358363,by more than what is being minted is there a dashboard for the total supply
358365,the vortex isnt burning anywhere enough fees at the moment to keep the supply from increasing
358366,i track it manually about 12h ago the total supply was 278914 984
358367,im listening to this right now at 3730 mark richardson kind of addresses this but his reasoning is lacking and he just says that as the bnt price drops the motivation to sell bnt at a certain price is diminished like is that the only thing preventing the selloff thats a very poor reason
358368,he says the market takes care of the rest like that is a very bad reassurance
358369,the 7 day cool of period also allows the protocol to prepare for the bnt sell offs but as i said bancor tg can answer in more detail than me
358370,currently 3ac celsius were the biggest dumpers of the token and that affected the current inflation according to m richardson
358371,ill have to ask mark for some kind of reimbursement for representing bancor here
358372,i would also like to get an url for tx which shows how the investor got less bnt from the swap
358373,man there really is no such thing as 100 il protection someone has to eat the il right now its bnt holders sure ill send it over
358374,i agree that it is mathematically impossible to avoid il the point is how incurs the cost for it and how minting bnt the cost is on bnt holders but burning bnt from swap fees removes that in time so in that sense the protocol revenue pays for the il
358375,i guess its a race and a numbers game also a game of trust that others will not all withdraw liquidity
358376,not really as slippage gets aggregated
358377,heres this guy who deposited 75k link and got back 42k link and 394k bnt
358378,its not just the bnt holders it is also the depositorswho take on slippage
358380,so they sacrifice protocol revenue and risk a death spiral for what exactly moar tvlthis sounds just like curve but more complicated and less sustainable
358381,lmao wait so when my lock ends on bancor v3 i wont be withdrawing my single asset they will give me bnt too fuuuuuuuiuu
358383,so you thought that 100 il protection means you will be getting your single asset back
358384,a death spiral in slomo is still a death spiral but i guess market sentiment can change in that period easing the selling pressure
358385,its kind of like when the nyse halts trading when something is going down too fast it does work because people act a little more rationally than they might if they just see the market imploding suddenly
358386,is close
358387,can you link the context please
358388,
358389,big liquidation potential
358390,thought everyone agreed that was cai wensheng not 3ac
358391,just whales getting gaped
358392,yes itsnot about that just looking at large liquidations
358393,cause again will is not giving parsec access scam
358394,
358395,how does aave work will 100 become available for liquidation under hf 1 or does it happen in chunks
358397,in v2 i think half the collat can be liqed at a time
358399,tnx so 75 k eth potentially yikes
358400,tbh that address sold this much and more last 3 days just on uniswap lmao
358401,i am more interested in cascading stuff dunno if it will happen
358402,should set up a page monitoring it with as the soundtrack
358403,liquidated
358404,nan

358424,103 is being a tease stuck at that for a while
358425,hey guys why are some wallets depositing eth as collateral to get stables coins most of times in lower amounts given it needs an over colateral what are they accomplishing except risking liquidations
358427,leverage
358428,if you think eth price will go up then you are profiting either by putting that stablecoins to get yield or buying more eth or spending stables instead of spending your eth
358429,nan
358430,lets go
358431,ok its kinda noisy now

358476,try scam wick to 10k
358477,the candle was going to literal 0
358478,mb smol cascade
358479,i was watching bitmex
358480,we were all in here
358481,it was literally going to 0
358482,had zero doubt crypto was over that day
358483,hard to say
358484,i hope u had bids
358485,
358486,no i sold at 9k and bought at 35k
358487,i am not larping
358488,cryptobro went all in eth at 80
358489,black thursday
358490,thanks for the prompt answer really appreciatedso the amount you have to give back to the protocol does not move when the market goes up i assume
358491,exactly
358492,it wouldve if they didnt stop the engine never forget
358493,this is not even untrue
358494,it skyrocketed before allowing bid whales to buy
358495,all systems were haywire ppl couldnt even move a cent
358496,nan
358497,hahaha someone trying to stop liqs
358498,sending 0001 w no message to that address
358499,
358500,that address has nouns and other nfts go drop some stinkbids save the poor soul longlingeth
358501,aave should airdrop some nft as achievement when you get liquidated for 8 or 9 figs
358502,the reason im asking is because of this article
358503,make it soulbound
358504,do you think this 200000 eth collateral was used as yo u described just sounds so irresponsible haha
358505,mashinksy is a dork who was scammy from day 0 i am sorry but we all saw it ages ago
358506,saw it arrogant didnt explain wtf he actually does leech
358507,if the past 2 months have taught us anything its that there is no limit to irresponsibility basically at all scales everyone is degenerate
358508,nan
358509,damnit just gape it already
358510,lmao thats trueso all those wallets depositing super large amount of eth as collateral are only doing this to double down on their existing position come on this must be more complex
358511,dont think so people just borrow against their eth to pay debts or do more crazy stuff with
358512,it starts from the tokenomics even though i lost a lot of money this is healthy for the space too many fucking retards regulation will come in and we will only see those who are only in it for the tech for a while the silent builders who are building actual products all the grifters and speculators will be long gone
358513,why not pay your debts with the eth you already own then
358514,for a long time silent builders were ignored and never appreciated because they didnt return 129323 apy
358515,wowoww wait
358516,defi is actually way more primitive than people assume
358517,this is kinda rekt
358518,lol then the whale got saved because usdc was slightly offpeg in chainlink
358519,what now
358520,stab pool empty what now
358521,jonas_from_austria iandao
358522,permabulls
358523,what happens if the stability pool is empty when liquidations occur if the stability pool is empty the system uses a secondary liquidation mechanism called redistribution in such a case the system redistributes the debt and collateral from liquidated troves to all other existing troves the redistribution of debt and collateral is done in proportion to the recipient troves collateral amount
358524,101
358525,hmm in layman terms it means other troves get more eth and winds down as a system basically
358526,lfg almost
358527,i guess so everyone gets a piece of the problem for the good of the system
358528,i guess i could phrase it more simplywhats the point of decentralized lending like aave since you need to deposit more than you will get bugs me out
358529,oh hey whats up
358530,liquidity on your position
358531,same reason why people remortgage their houses to buy nice cars
358532,got no skin in lusdusually everyone else gets to pay for bad debt these protocols like to call it socialising the debt
358533,care to elaborate
358534,are these liquidations that significant ive assumed theres already been billions dumpedliqd in btc and eth daily
358535,nope
358536,i just have nothing better to watch
358537,nan
358538,not like i can get a boner when my net worth dropped to 0 in one day
358539,we watch the fireworks from a safe distance
358540,that would be some findom stuff
358541,at least it isnt negative
358542,ct is quite entertaining if you ask me
358543,if u got a dollar to your name you outtraded 3ac
358544,1nw 1nw but same yes
358545,if you borrow eth and lend stables you can short ethif you borrow stables and lend eth you can long eth any amt you can borrow relative to your position size is relevant insofar as it limits your max leverage amt
358546,idk ct is filled with shill and people writing threads of each other threads on the best of days and everyone else circle jerking about how smart they all are
358547,essentially have access to capital generally in the form of some stable currency without having to sell your assets
358549,man the schadenfreude is insufferable
358550,ahem
358551,im sure some luminary has something figured out and are printing money probably the dude who wrote the code for the liqudations im not going to compete with that
358552,oef
358553,sheesh
358554,wrap the wiener for the beaver
358555,dai frax soon
358556,its pvp season actually it always has just that when incoming liquidity was bountiful these people really bought the wagmi koolaid
358557,wow thanks so much owen im probably going to need a couple of videos here to understand this more clearly
358558,this feels very apt in here rn as people are baying for this random dude to be liquidate for 21mil usd lmao
358559,got you thanks my dude
358560,i suppose there is a 10 haircut incentive for liquidating the vaulttrove theres your answer theres food to be had
358562,who was the luckysmart fellows few years ago who bought out almost the entire mkr protocols vaulted eth for 0 dollars the other time
358563,id much prefer that not to happen again
358564,oxmikko can u liquidate it urself blz already we just wanna see it
358565,nan
358566,gape it
358567,gape it now
358568,that was black thursday iirc
358569,brb buying cat ears headphones and becoming a twitch egirl
358570,roflmao brutal
358572,this dashboard shows 60 and usdc usdp which i guess is a bit betternot sure which dashboard is correct and why is there so much difference
358573,ruhroh
358574,nan
358575,nan
358576,dump it now
358577,please stop trading everyone and just shut up
358579,how long does it take for liquidation to happen
358580,its in chunks on aave right
358581,volt is pretty much a tribe project
358583,nan
358584,oh damn 75k eth is not that small
358585,its dust
358586,5050 on v2 afaik
358587,yeah both compound and aave are 5050
358588,would be hilarious if he just repays in between
358589,they did last time i hope they sleeping now
358590,no thats like the best chase sequence ever
358591,lmaoo
358592,tetranode got rekt
358593,is crypto really over this time
358594,and txn with msg fuk u all
358595,he is not rekt just down
358596,not sure for this their liq prices are way lower
358597,wow one by one all the big size boys go down
358599,for aave you can use a flashloan as liquidatoor right
358600,cel liquidation is still at 13kish
358601,he deleveraged a lot during last eth slump to low 2kpresent health factor in his wallet is goodbut only 13mn worth of nw left at this price level in publicly known wallet
358602,tetra is fine lmfao
358603,in his discord he is just leaving twitter
358604,fine means only down 80
358605,do you know his ath net worth lmao
358606,many of their wallets r unknown i d assume nw for them and idc tbh
358607,money becomes meaningless past a point
358608,he is living a very comfortable lifestyle
358609,it never does tho maybe you just become bet more
358610,what lmao
358611,heard it was like 1b lol
358612,you keep gambling more no matter how much you have won
358613,having more becomes meaningless at some point but losing it never does
358614,in terms of lifestyle past a certain point wealth means nothing
358615,agreed
358617,sounds like a great way to get rekt
358620,
358621,sers this in kingdom blz buy the nft worth 0 now anyway and join the chat pinned message
358622,is it safe to hold dai now
358623,are we going to see exchanges fall next
358624,as safe as holding a large amount of usdc
358625,last cycle only shit tier ones like liqui got rekt
358626,in my experience anything beyond 34 million in cash starts to create exponential less marginal utility per pound earnedat that level you own your own nice property comfortably and can just stick money in safer equities and farmsure you cant buy a boat or plane but it doesnt matter as much tbh
358627,i would bet all my money that binance will not fall
358628,funny game
358629,why is that any real reasons gladly major exchanges went through 12 cycles
358630,but cant be blacklisted
358631,needs to have a public leaderboard for me all strategies seems to end up around 400k of gdp
358632,wow doteth
358633,some may have gambled their funds by giving it to 3ac or blcokfi for example
358634,we didnt have these in the last cycle
358635,why would an exchange give their fund to 3ac
358636,well we never know what happens behind the scenes but i doubt tier1 exchanges degen their money in such ways
358637,im pissed because i let someone psych me out about adding a short layer at the last time we hit 1225
358638,this is awesome
358639,they were like it probably bounces to 1400 and i was like sure fine that sounds reasonable
358640,biggest leak is letting others have opinions on me trades
358642,standard practice saw on ct
358643,ok convo got too randomctrlf for new members dont spam very trivial basic stuff please
358645,is this that standard tho source i doubt that coinbasekraken gamble like that maybe w 1 of a balance but that doesnt count
358646,who here on lenstershilling it because i think its awesome gotta move all of web3 twitter to it
358647,i think i saw larry or someone else tweet i wasnt drunk but maybe brain farting
358648,so what happened did that aave position get liquidated
358649,reason to do it is interest
358650,was wondering the same we dropped below 1k
358651,ofc if u have investment arm or so
358652,not yet
358653,i guess eth is too bearish
358654,cexs already have some exposure to risk via direct defi participation
358655,no one wants to hold it even for the amount of time needed to dump it
358656,wait if that aave pos didnt get liquidated yet that is bad news for the solvency of the whole system
358657,it went down to that level at for a few seconds bots might not have had enough of a gap to profit after slippage anyway for now price bounced 888 bidders in china saved them
358658,hmm maybe thats the issue i guess if you dump 75k eth maybe the discount isnt enough to make a profit
358659,it would have been conceptually but eth has billions in liquidity still so that was not the case please see my msg
358660,you dont have to liquidate it all at once
358661,you can nibble
358662,5050
358663,i thought its at 50 50
358664,nibble is for maker right
358665,tbh depends does it have liquidity to absorb 35bil in one day on sell side alone after consistent sell offs in this macro environment
358666,where you bite and then auction
358667,you dont have to liquidate 50 you can liquidate as little as you want
358668,just enough to get collat ratio requirements met not whole position
358669,source i run a liquidation bot on an aave fork
358670,no up to 50 in a single shot
358671,ah okay thank u for confirming
358672,but yeah if you do 20 and that is enough to get the position above 10 hf no one can liquidate it anymore
358674,tbh i was talking of different scenario u are right
358675,nan
358676,please scroll up
358678,not sure if fully true but here it is
358679,should lower it to 888 choyna is buying there
358680,risk of some pieces within price oracle looking at venues where people might not have bids so its easier to have higher level so it would be arbed potentially at above the leven you want across everywhere
358681,idk what i just said i am gaped
358682,his liq penalty would be around 35m usd maybe less than slippage
358683,yeah interesting how it will play out if price nukes 50 instantly
358684,aave safety pool deposits or whatever the name is will rekt if not enough printing and aave holders rekt
358685,it is possible that if the oracle ends up saying the price is such that your pos is liquidatable but on chain the price is much better than the oracle the liquidator is going to have a wonderful time
358694,a lil positivity for those on pure trading side
358695,ps ofc sharding isnt 100 confirmed but ye thought to spread some gud vibes in these times
358696,
358697,data shards are in spec another bit of news currently being overlooked because merge is front and center is that the specs for validator excess balance withdrawals just merged in
358698,so high wow y not rugged yet
358699,could be shorts
358700,nan
358701,billions of shorts there almost every bounce is just shorts closing and little spot to hunt liquidations
358703,im a terrible short term trader especially with leverage but been alright recently now what baffles me more than anything is why the hell tron hasnt been driven into the ground
358704,most of the traders are terrible esp w leverage
358706,because his excellency is based
358707,very based
358708,
358709,3 of the top 5 earn 0 revenue
358710,great business innit
358711,tfw an intern can misclick away your collateral
358713,is there any reason the aave liquidation wouldnt just be filled with a flash loan and all the eth collateral sent as a bribe to a miner
358714,damn health is now 106
358715,
358716,i like to do technical analysis at an emotional psychological level not using geometry and charts
358717,ngl this is bs tbh price can go to bera levels in this macro condition
358718,i mean yes low vol high volatility weekend good for stop loss hunting but unlikely its as straightforward as this makes it seem like it
358719,fair lol
358721,its called bias shitposting look it up
358723,
358726,posted some macro thoughts incase anyone is interested
358727,still want to know if this is the case and if so why folks so worked up about the liquidation lol
358728,how do you repay the flashloan
358729,the collateral is eth the debt is some other token token b in order to liquidate you provide token b and receive eth at a discounted rate based on the oracles valuation of eth and token b sure you can get a flash loan of token b and pay off the loan with it and now you have a bunch of eth you now owe that amount of token b and have a bunch of ethhow do you think were going to get token b
358734,any service where i can see historical pricesfloors for nft collections
358735,
358736,nan
358737,ty sir
358742,nan
358743,
358744,didnt find this one on polymarket
358745,this guy beat me to it
358746,is there a decentralised version of a crypto trading bot with features like take profit stop loss trailing stop etc i get that there is yearn that manage vaults like a hedge fund likely using a kind of auto programmed trading strategies but havent found a standalone protocol which provides customizable trading bots
358747,not sure its possible to build decentralizedif so 100 based on smart contracts without off chain logic anyone will be able to frontrun this bots tx attack itanother side anyone is able to build a bot with automated scripts as u mentionedbut this will be offchain logic nobody has access to cant attack
358749,hey guise do we have a one pager on why someone would need lobsterdao nft ie what are the benefits
358750,
358751,
358753,support group
358754,no benefits only liabilities
358755,you are obligated to do reverse airdrops
358756,jpg that has community spirit and sometimes you can get jackpot eg coinlist karma or airdrops
358757,how much treasury does yfi has maybe there is a dashboard banteg shill blz
358758,
358759,is it possible to adjust it to understand treasury value without their native tokens any service for that
358760,
358761,is there smth like wbtc cafe maxroszko
358762,ivan
358763,buy ltc
358764,no i bought btc
358765,yeah two atm offering bridgeswap although fairly new and not sure if they have hooked in curve yet for wbtc liq
358766,fuck btc
358767,are you saying i can trust these
358768,yeah they are fam
358769,anyone has that island boys video of loomdart asking for a friend
358770,is there good ui that helps you construct call data for an open source contract
358771,vote yes enact special margin requirements for large whales that represent over 20 of borrows and grant emergency power to solend labs to temporarily take over the whales account so the liquidation can be executed otcman im glad we got rid of centralised finance where they could just take our fundsif im not mistaken theyve put a 6 hour voting deadlineon a sunday such governance
358772,business laws always take risk with someone elses money
358774,actually thats quite pro from the solend team i wish all team would be that proactive
358775,same worst day ever in crypto
358777,damn before community governance there should be community onchain iq test
358778,yeah would be nice if all teams could take over your account after executing a pretend gubernance vote
358779,the guy is free to take his money out
358780,hes been warned for days
358781,yeah hes been warned for days to checks notes stop using the platform correctly
358782,most likely its the foundation
358783,cant have people using a pretend decentralized lending platform where they think they can just use it as designed because like who knows what will happen if they get liquidated right
358784,shit coins that deserve to die
358785,personally i propose getting on a conference call with the validators to ask them to censor liquidation txs that would drop the price of their pet coin by more than 01 only nice liquidation txs executed by whitelisted entities they trust should be permitted to liquidate anyone all for the good of the system
358786,
358787,the problem can be solved if they stop the chain cant get liquidated if it doesnt work
358788,grant emergency power to solend labs to temporarily take over the whales account so the liquidation can be executed otc and avoid pushing solana to its limits this would be done via a smart contract upgrade emergency powers will be revoked once the whales account reaches a safe leveli cant think of anything else that feature could possibly be used for especially for something people use thinking its noncustodial nope not one
358789,devs are trying to do something
358790,that is literally the antithesis of defi wow
358791,well you have a governance vote
358792,its a 160m tranche isnt it were worried that a 160m liquidation takes down solana
358793,and as we all know those totally arent gamed plutocraciesi hope solend labs protecs users from bad people in the future when the relevant parties come knocking we take over their account temporarily of course and give the funds involved to the relevant 3letter agencies and their friends
358794,its okay because its bad people
358796,we can send them a message like this onchain to warn them beforehand just in case
358797,hey guys someone have the wallet of the whale who are near of solona liquidation
358798,
358799,danke
358800,nah offcain prices will plummet while the chain is stuck so solend will end up with a bad debt
358801,
358802,atlast some people are doing something to save the space
358803,the current dao proposal is even worse
358804,taking over someones account
358805,oh yeah well then again its solana
358806,anyone know if there is a definitive list of peopleprojects building on zksync at all
358807,you can check their discord all the projects building there are present in dev discord
358808,i think you get an invite to join that dev discord not sure if its public
358809,do you have one ty men
358810,dmd you one
358811,could you send me one too
358812,feel like cardano has officially jumped the shark
358813,nan
358814,nan
358815,governance
358818,very defi much noncustodial
358819,the rich always have haters
358820,wow this was no tilted like 2 hrs ago
358821,yeah single voter made a 1m yes vote
358822,whales ousting whales
358823,will people with big wallets will still use the platform after this vote is passed
358824,nan
358825,probably not
358826,whats the point then lol
358827,just put a cap then
358828,wouldnt that be better
358829,trustless and non custodial gone out the window but really it should be baked into the protocol to limit sizes if they dont believe dexes have liquidity to handle this
358830,yeah like a savings account s tbc
358831,yeahh
358832,ive been watching their github to see if they put up a pr first or just send it
358833,dao decideddao taketh
358834,they should take back vc tokens also
358835,your money is now our money
358836,can you put up a vote for rugging as well
358837,ask mc for guidance
358839,as someone that holds 2 solend tokens and believes everything we do should maximise token value i propose the tokens be seized and used to market bid the solend tokens
358840,if we use the money to repay some of celsius and 3acs debts maybe market pump
358841,i feel we need to think about the big picture here marketwide pump good for everyone
358842,breaking binance buys the dip adds 101266 bitcoin
358843,so cz deployed capital
358844,steady lads
358845,you will own nothing and you will be happy
358846,rewkang kind of hitting under the belt huh honestly expected better of you
358847,it just shows how guilty they are
358848,shilling ada and doxxing zach down bad
358849,seems like waves set an questionable precedent
358850,deleted
358851,yeah deleted
358852,
358853,a lot of controversy surrounding this mornings solend dao proposal vote to take over the account of a whale who is close to getting liquidated 98 of voting power from one wallet
358854,and dao was spun up this morning
358855,
358856,much better
358857,yeah i couldnt say it better i talked a bit to the solend team back in the days but that decision is just fucked up its a design flaw let it happen thats all
358858,ok but dont we realize a lot of these protocols arent really decentralized anyways
358859,im pretty sure i heard stani himself in clubhouse a year ago talk about how these things need to be run like a dictatorship plenty of admin keys exist on ethereum protocols dont they
358860,correct and most stuff can be changed via a vote most lending protocols need that power
358861,i mean they just dont realize because of the community and vcs pressure that theyll will get a lawsuit from this protowhale closing his position and liquidating it at 50 of its liquidation is just a whole mess
358862,is there a lawsuit to be had though
358863,it was voted on by the community no
358864,lol
358865,wheres the terms of service and crypto rights declaration
358866,i get robinhood could get away with it because tos
358867,who says we have right in this space though
358868,lawsuit deez nuts
358869,next time gubernance can vote to take over multiple accounts that are found to be controlled by the same entity because protec users
358870,youre just cringe they made a dao voting lasting 3 hours on a sunday where 90 of the votes came from the same wallet mysteriously funded
358871,if thats the community
358872,they shoulda rockedthevote a couple days ago but now its at a point where act quick or dont
358873,is it better to just let things break
358874,yes
358875,well it will work as expected right just price will go down
358876,even though its gonna result in the protocol not functioning the way it was intended
358877,no
358878,it wont
358879,it works as expected if theres enough liquidity to close out the trade
358880,what part of a liquidation is a protocol not functioning as intended
358881,if theres not then things break
358882,the part where theres not enough market liquidity to cover the gap and fill the order
358883,what does that have to do with the liquidation
358884,the code was written to protect the lenders
358885,its not doing its intended job
358886,this is hilarious
358887,huh when did protection translate to elimination of risk
358888,anyone who thinks most protocols dont work this way are fooling themselves
358889,two gamefi daos signing a contract and splitting ways legally goes viral6 hour old solana dao forcing liquidation 1 thread with 20 likes
358890,so it is not useless gov tokens anymore it could take away money from so
358891,who said elimination of risk
358892,if you think liquidation of collateral and not getting enough to pay back the loan is functioning as intended then ok
358893,wasnt ygg practically forced to accept
358894,you when you insinuate theres a problem with a liquidation because something about liquidity
358895,yes
358896,there is lmfao
358897,so the risk is not enough liquidity on chain innit
358898,yes which could makes the protocol not function as intended
358899,it was probably written with the lens that there would be enough liquidity
358900,not enough liquidity to handle a 150m position hmm
358901,
358902,yes its a relatively small ecosystem compared to ethereum
358903,vincent is a masterful troll
358904,also the markets are not buying like they were so liquidity down even more
358905,sure
358906,so is the team protecting solana or the lender
358907,funny considering stani is an angel or seed investor in solend
358908,wouldnt it be both
358909,they have enough time to be stealing voting away peoples money but not enough time to be building a means to handle the liquidation safely
358910,tbh we havent seen yet how eth gonna handle a 150 mln liquidation yet
358911,wat
358912,well thats bad as well then lol
358913,are they supposed to go out and find an otc buyer
358914,to put in a buy order at 22 or whatever
358915,thats unreasonable
358916,is there no way to simulate these scenarios
358917,i would expect people to think about these worst cases
358918,sure but it wont react the way a live market would
358919,of course it wont but you cant just wait until it happens always
358920,or if people are already doing some math around it then its fine
358921,well to a certain extent but such liquidations will have a social compotent which is largely an unknown
358922,ah yes that is unreasonable not voting away someones money but that
358923,fake dao fake defi fake protocol
358924,why overcomplicate it
358925,social component as in people panicking and getting out
358926,as long as we dont hold ethereum to different standards
358927,also well liquidate someone at what 10 under their price
358928,who cares
358929,me clearly lmao
358930,chainlink cant even liquidate people when they should be multiple times
358931,because if were gonna be critical we should be critical
358932,its not an sol vs eth thing its a solend sucks kinda thing
358933,yeah or maybe they will rally and never let the liquidation hit tbh eth has billions in liquidity on dexes so a 150 million should be theoretically fine
358934,well its a most of these protocols arent really decentralized thing imo
358935,if you want to try whataboutism you should at least put some effort into it
358936,so if they didnt do this vote what are the main risks they are so concerned about not recouping bad debt and being in the red or something worse
358937,you just working that out lol
358938,understood
358939,seems liek the community is
358940,no
358941,then again thats expecting too much from someone who thinks voting away someones money is not unreasonable
358942,pretty sure most are aware that daos are chinese democracy by now
358943,stealing that term
358944,guns n roses
358945,probably the strongest group of investors in all of solana dapps they dont want solend to fail
358946,it does fail if they carry through with these actions though
358947,interesting set of people
358948,voting away someones money whos putting a whole community at risk yes
358949,of course comrade
358950,1010 times
358951,well then shouldnt they come up with a liquidity solution instead of taking over an account
358952,sometimes they need to show their hand to protect their bagspeople will forget and then theyll go back to talking about decentralization lol
358953,why did they allow the loan then
358954,cause up only
358955,because it was code
358956,up only ser
358958,funny how they require new code to deal with it
358959,and i bet a dollar to a dime this scenario is written into lending protocols in the future
358960,we are in the supercycle untill we aint
358961,what scenario is that lol
358962,sol is rekt market is rekt solend is rekt
358963,shit new code
358964,lol thats what they did essentially
358965,imagine putting your money into alameda anything
358966,therell be max loans compared to available liquidity some sort of mechanism
358967,do like vcs with experience in lending protocol not like share their knowledge or sth
358968,the limit part or the dao taking over your account part
358969,kek
358970,they can write that into the terms for the service vincent lol
358971,no code required
358972,i remember a thread from rooter the founder basically saying vcs are useless and it seemed to be directed at his investors
358973,next governance proposal coming
358974,what a genius
358975,angel investor didnt share enough knowledge so he gets a refund of his capital
358977,
358978,they did not consider checks notes liquidation working as it always has because flips the page there is a risk of bad debt that squints has existed in platforms that are older than solana itself
358979,want to take a guess which of those vcs detracted value
358980,well most really are useless
358981,well you need capital one way or another you either take the money from vcs or you raise it from retail and get accused of rug each time shit happens because retail wants all the upside of early investments but none of the risks
358982,since its for the community i recommend splitting the money in half and redistributing it to the voters this will align incentives and motivate them to vote in the future
358983,how much value did they get by simply having those names on the front pagetends to bring in the crowds even when the vcs are clearly net negative in every other aspect
358984,blacklist anyone who sells their airdrops
358985,funny thing is i doubt there would be more than like idk 20 just throwing a guesstimate out there gap
358986,and everyone could just eat the 20
358987,or whatever it is and things would be okay
358988,we have after all determined this is a bad whale putting the system at risk and we cant have that like imagine what would happen if these people didnt vote on time right
358989,i actually dont think thats a crazy thing to let happen
358990,of course you dont
358991,imagine if he gets a second chance to use that evil capital to place another protocol at such risk
358992,i just dont get how you can liquidate someone when its not at a liquidation price
358993,indeed think of the risk
358994,if anything they should find a liquidation price where slippage would without a doubt not fuck up filling the order
358995,its 20 at 223021m
358996,hardly a kings ransom
358997,i think bigger whales should dump solana to the liq point to ensure it gets liquidated before the dao can get through with this
358998,and if you gunna do otc liquidation maybe do that like once it hits that price
358999,so the whale decided to cause cascading liquidation to send sol to 0 onchain because thats his strategybut due to bad code the community decide to deny his profit making strategykinda selfish that could be 3ac trying to earn it back in 1 trade
359000,potentially
359001,returning ownership of the money to its rightf excuse me former owner means potentially putting some future protocol at risk because this bad whale might do this again we can even use some of the money to set up a low liquidity dump fund
359002,another fair point ser
359003,if you take his money this will deter future villains from placing the system at riskits a way of educating the users as to what is the expected behaviorwin win
359004,if one house is becoming a brothel doesnt mean you benchmark your house to it need better nuances to conscience than just being 1mn voting fake dao defining how a 270mn wallet should behave and commit a broad daylight robbery
359005,
359006,no but if were gonna be critical of the centralization lets not forget to be critical of centralization
359007,thats my only point there
359008,theres levels to it solend just took it all the way
359009,but they like to pretend defi is better than cefi
359010,anyone knows how assange would be charged
359011,if the us gov gets their way probably in a chair
359012,when he is extradited back to us
359013,what does that means
359014,what will he face a life sentence
359015,
359016,means a chair sir
359017,wdym boss chainlink does liquidate anyone unless same providers run liquidations bots which they should but it didnt appear to be so apparent so far that 101 hf position was not relevant to chainlink functioning anywsy
359018,next phase of the master plan execute order 33 for maximum prosperity
359019,every one of these investors has 1000 bags more stop thinking that investors do the work pleb thinking some of them are very helpful but end of the day their advice can also be ignored by core devs
359026,is there somewhere a price analysis based on historic data of previous bear markets trying to figure out the optimal entry point
359029,whats the refresh time on the oracle 5 mins 10 mins
359030,all the money raised by assange dao goes to wikileak foundation
359031,the official twitter of wikileak approved that
359032,stop weird shit w ur ponzis sers those are okay in lobsterdao kingdom kinda there u can scream and do trading but here its polluting sowwy
359033,tick price change and also
359034,
359035,incredible the market makers are too good
359036,try to beat jump and wintermute at latency you wont
359037,i cant post media in here but the price bottomed at 880
359038,how was liq avoided then still confused about this
359039,can someone verify that these numbers are right
359040,i was under the impression it was cause the oracle didnt update
359041,someone familiar with solana fees
359042,because it was not the usd oracle that was looked at in aave case
359043,its the eth oracle so for the oracle to really update it should have been basically overthepricetick kinda
359044,so everything worked just fine really the discrepancy was for a second
359045,nan
359046,aave doesnt use the chainlink ethusd feed because all assets and feeds are denominated in eth
359047,chainlink oracles also look not only at 1 exchange but at multitudes to avoid cases where 1 data point fails
359048,u could pull the data from the contract at every instance
359049,there is nothing about aave or eth or any insolvency in defi at all idk where people dig that out from
359050,i mean i get it but it seems like data points to all is bueno
359051,just seems weird to have a market price of 880 which would of been similar elsewhere and were talking 895 on the oracle
359052,anyways dont want to clog the chat dont take it as an attack lol
359053,im also curious on this
359054,so how do you denominate an eth position
359055,i think here talks about that i dont work at aave ihave no idea
359056,thanks mate
359057,does usdd work exactly the same as ust did the minting and burning of trx usdd
359058,or is it differnt
359059,yes
359060,the same
359061,f
359062,ehh sort of minting and burning is controlled by a multisig and only certain authorized parties are allowed to mint withburn trxusdd
359063,thx for this
359064,i didnt know
359065,so this being centralized means that death spiral is much more difficult
359066,no
359067,not everyone can redeem iirc and thats big difference
359068,agree big difference
359069,thanks all
359070,
359071,
359073,wheres the demand coming from is it still their synth markets or is it lyra or smth else
359074,milli3e feel free to shill
359075,demand comes from people panicking about their synth positions
359077,as the protocol is on the verge of maybe collapsing it actually generates the most fees building a buy narrative kinda amazing to witness
359081,that is not correct ethereum has interest for holders through burnt ethaave takes a percentage of the interest paymentsalso funny that they stopped it before it reached curve or ens
359083,if you had like a geth rpc api you can call by a get request lets not argue if it should be post or get would you prefer1 or2
359084,1 doesnt really make much sense in the path semantics at least for the params part
359085,how come
359086,2 it conforms to get requests
359087,param1valueparam2value2 look like a nested structure which is what the path is supposed to represent which is a very different mental modal of what they actually mean
359088,hmmm ok 2 is uglier tho
359089,and takes up more space
359090,it is an api who cares if it takes up more space or is uglier
359091,cuz u want it to be human readable too
359092,yep i agree its uglier on a first look but its using the intended representationif presentation is an issue you can always abstract in a nicer script encoding objects into url params is pretty standard
359093,1 also wouldnt play well with a lot of http tooling btw
359094,dev tooling i mean
359095,how would you make it look nicer what kinda tooling
359096,dont forget that thus far no one of those authorized parties burned any usdd
359097,low level example most languages have some sort of uri encodedecode functionality that allows you to take a url change the value of param1 and get a new urlin your pretty approach you lose the semantics of what each argument is called so you cant do those operations
359098,speaking of usdd headsup for those shorting it on justlend
359099,i would use post with a json payload but you said not to discuss that part
359100,i can only use get i want a nft tokenuri to point to eth function call
359101,get is also fine btw but i guess my question is why the concern on making it look nicer
359103,yep but that can be done with external tooling
359105,at an extreme you could even use the raw hex calldata as the only param and decode that on the outside
359106,which is what wallets already do with your regular transactions
359107,what you want it seems is show the user this will call contractfunca1a2
359112,its a deviation trigger and a heartbeat has nothing to do with time ethusd updates every 05 or every hour if there has not been a 05 move in that hour
359113,theres good and theres not good this is not good their assets probably dropped at least 40 since dec 21 and yields dropped at least 50 theyll need to raise a lot or downscale a lot
359114,basically when ever pools on univ3 or other dexes have liquidity imbalances and there is volatility in the spot markets on cexs a lot of swap volume on 1inch and curve run through synthetix atomic swaps that and futures on optimism have been picking up volume recently
359115,
359116,cool thread
359117,absolutely wrong
359118,
359119,bro do these people even google
359120,also hilarious that the bis has a pride flag on their logo
359121,literally helped facilitate nazi war crimes how they are still an institution with any reputation speaks volumes of society
359122,maybe hilarious not the best phrase
359123,that guy is good mani remember him gifting 2btc to some researcher randomly lol
359124,andrewsmartcontract isnt he poor
359125,oh no no the btc guy
359126,wang chun
359128,all right
359130,ok if i share a project im working on at the moment
359132,should we make a bip to take out all satoshi not moved btc in 10 years and airdrop it proportionally to all btc hodlers imho thats fair lost coins shouldnt be lost forever 21m 21m as proposer i should get 1 of saved btc thats imho fair i will be glad to code this in for free will give 50 of my earnings from this to people who approve my pr
359137,next we should implement a negative interest rate on unmoved coins if people arent using bitcoins they arent contributing to the adoption of bitcoin of course we need to maintain 21m 21m so we airdrop the bitcoins from negative interest to the people actually using bitcoin
359138,bitcoin robinhoods vision
359139,great idea nakamote will be proud of us csv even more but for real
359140,if its a small message just to showcase it maybe a small link and a 1 sentence why its unique is oke ser
359141,so do we need daos anymore
359142,hello contracts dont work because someone terminated one
359143,can we not blz either decent takes or nothing
359144,
359145,
359146,this is just a random larp marketing move dontravlos
359147,doesnt seem to have any relevance
359148,simon was involved in the bitfinex hack restructuring
359149,funny that the bailouts are happening in crypto nowadays
359150,so dunno if they will take him up on it so yeah maybe marketing
359151,no
359152,big difference between publicly financed bailouts and private investors looking to not lose their principle by restructuring obligations
359153,crypto printer go brrr why reinventing the wheel
359156,due to hostile market conditions bancors impermanent loss protection is temporarily paused il protection will be reactivated on the protocol as the market stabilizesmore info were hosting a community ama in 15 minutes
359157,so just to be clear that means that if you would normally get say 50 tkn and 50 bnt you now just get 50 tkn and no bntif you decide to withdraw while il compensation is disabled thats correctlol so basically bancor rugged is the protocol insolvent
359158,as of thursday we were confident that the protocol was healthy
359159,we found most recently that a celsius wallet was withdrawing large amounts of liquidity from the protocol
359160,this was further exacerbated by a coordinated flight of liquidity coming right after
359161,if withdrawals were being processed in a more organic way then the protocol would have been able to handle it
359162,there appears to be a hostile antagonist creating short positons manipualting the bnt price down combine with large amounts of withdraws happening simultaneously
359163,we were left with an uncomfortable decision of letting it play out or do something about it
359164,damn everyone blames it on mercenary liquidity hostile antagonist or a coordinated whale attack
359165,as we wait for markets to stabilize we are investigating the best methods to restore il protectionthe most elaborate attempt ive seen at trying to solve impermanent loss the flaw is thinking its something that is solvable
359166,i thought bancor had some new verison of an amm so they just paid you to sit in the pool
359167,historically yes in v3 no
359168,oh
359169,well why didnt they migrate everyone to v3 i remember a bunch of hype around that
359170,at best the risk can be transferred to another user for a premium there are some innovative ways to solve this something i plan on writing about implementing soon
359171,yup risk cannot be destroyed only transformed
359172,the bancor death spiral came sooner than expected
359173,if you want to solve impermanent loss then you get rid of liquidity provision but that puts lps out of business
359175,solve is the wrong word for it its like saying solving smart contract exploit risk depeg risk etc through insurance is possible its not a solution but it is an option to somewhat mitigate that risk and on the other side possibly gain from offering cover
359176,its not really a risk problem its not even a problem its people trying to eat their cake and have it they want to be able to profit from providing liquidity and lose nothing from liquidity being used as liquidity
359177,i believe there is an equilibrium point at which an lp would accept the risk of il on behalf of other lps who wish to have no exposure to il if the terms of the agreement and underlying yield are enough to in most cases compensate for potential losses considering swap yields right now it should result in competitive rates for both sides
359179,the problem isnt the risk its people not managing their risk effectively enough
359181,reeeeee mods
359182,of course theres a lot of finagling you can do and when the market is good it sorta works andre tried that too id say bancor especially being paired with their dex was the most thorough attempt not sure why certain people kept on claiming they never mentioned certain things andor tried to redefine funny terms when everything was pretty laid out but it doesnt work because youre trying to solve having your leg broken by a car when the problem isnt that cars break legs or that you have legs but that you let a car on your leg
359183,lol in the bancor tg people are accusing the team of doing leveraged trading with their liquidity you have to understand what the risk is even before managing it
359184,nobody complains about impermanent loss after making a limit order on insert cex
359185,weve been working on a few experimental pool types hope to have some simulationsactual data to show soon and it is nice to see the market pushing each of these innovative products to the extreme
359186,which is another problem that kinda reveals itself in crypto theres a lot of winknod about dyor but very clearly the messaging is lostalso theres a lot of honour system at play too if you give ppl the ability to do shit you dont want them to do someone is gonna do it
359187,well part of the problem is marketing sole focus on growth at all costs means you turn a blind eye when you have users who comes into the system without ever fully understanding what they are participating into
359188,when can we declare a protocol obsolete im just deeply triggered by the il pause
359189,when the devs stop doing something
359190,i think its partially marketing and partially devs expecting everyone or most people to know the same things they do and i guess not exclusive to them either i see this sentiment as though getting rekt is some kind of rite of passage at times most marketing types ive encountered are barely able to explain or understand the risks themselves and its entirely up to founders to recognize this and push for their users to be better educated
359191,eh that can be completeness see liquity
359192,imo once a competitor protocol in the same vertical has emerged a clear winner
359193,but were very much not there yet
359194,yeap seems completely fair
359195,depends on the vertical as well i see no reason you cant have 1294837 mildly successful lending protocols that survive for years but i have a winner takes all view on dexes
359196,have you even really experienced crypto if you havent gone to complete 0 atleast once but tbh i agree with mismatch between what dev expects their users to be aware of and what they are actually aware of and it doesnt help that most of the loudest influencers have no idea beyond the superficial stuff or dont want to discuss stuff that wont pump their bags
359197,at least we can say its not even pmf with multisig keys controlling everything being in place forever
359198,bancor was always risky
359199,always felt too good to be true almost obviously so
359200,and yeah they tried to solve a for a circular rectangle very crypto indeed to try to make such things
359201,we walked so they could run but yeah thats also true its something that needs to change but i think this is something that has to be pressure from the community itself you cant be the future of finance if shit hits the fan and everyone goes lol tough shit
359202,yeah i never used their v2 but v3 looked a bit better never expected after 115 weeks of opening the gates for them to pull the rug
359203,i feel like once a year bancor comes out with a feature claiming to have done the impossible and then a few weeks later announces the feature has been shut down because it turned out to be impossible
359204,bancor v2 turned out to be massively gameable so they launched bancor v21 which turned out to be massively dilutive so they launched bancor v3 which turned out
359205,this is a loose sketch apologies if im misremembering the sequence
359206,they keep trying
359207,now lping everywhere leads to il kek
359208,tldr on v2 being gameable
359209,oracle updates got fruntrun for fun and profit
359210,lping without il risk isnt lping its lending
359211,v21 sought to socialize the il risk across all pairs it actually could have worked if they had the fees that uni did but unfortunately the entire country went bankrupt
359212,but why would socializing that risk be a good idea
359213,sadly the french never win
359214,you could always lp across a group of pools if you wanted to diversify
359215,maybe they only hold one shitcoin
359216,have you looked into swaap finance on polygon they claim to help heavily reduce il with a matrix market maker approach
359217,at the end of the day someone has to lose doesnt matter how much math word play you use
359218,a solution to il a guaranteed profitable trading strategy it doesnt exist longterm
359219,they arent saying its a solution the protocol wont allow trading if pools become unbalanced more than 2
359220,wrong
359221,can just mint tokens sir
359222,touche
359223,math enthusiasts euphoric
359224,interested to know more were working on an interest rate futures system sounds like there could be some overlap
359227,solend is redoing the vote
359228,would be happy to chat dm me whenever youre available
359229,
359230,
359231,pe not healthy though what are the calc
359232,my size is defo not his size
359233,
359234,hellohow can i seeuse functins of smart contract if it is not verified
359235,is it possible
359236,nan
359237,seems way off from this
359238,you are calculating pe of vecrv
359239,holding crv is only down its just a cool way to get bailout ofc we use it but why will someone want to hold it is the question
359240,its a good stablecoin to hold
359241,that pe seems off btw you should be calculating it from the mcap of vecrv not circulating or fdv
359242,vecrv mcapfees this year2 would give a better picture
359243,lol
359244,it is handing out 23 in stable yield if your not after 100000000x multiples its an ez game to play honestly hold compound
359245,idk man maybe cuz they shut down il protectiondamn this convo aged well
359246,its not stable ser
359247,it is when you come to peace with the fact that stability is an illusion
359248,its stable if you denominate your wealth in crv
359249,sure did
359250,i am now pondering should i just ride it out or get 50 haircut
359251,just ride mate no rzn for a haircut if u can afford it
359252,after this carnage it just internet funny money
359253,thanks to solend team for amplifying my pitch
359256,
359257,again with that retail euphemism
359258,thats a dota pfp
359259,based
359260,the borrower can buy 10 of solend supply for 1 of its borrowed position in order to vote against the proposal
359261,wait wtf the proposal already passed
359262,6 hour proposal is the whale voter ondemand for any proposal
359263,also not sure why solend wants to get into the issue of getting into legal liability while they could easily revive the makerdao backstop mechanism raising usdc to liquidate that position
359265,can we get enough votes on a governance proposal to peg btc on solana to 100k please on all dexes
359266,anon whale be like i cant do that man i need to hold up the defi ethos man please its already a tough battle i am fighting with ct please dont add the btc maxis to it man
359267,hellohow can i seeuse functins of smart contract if it is not verified
359268,only a matter of time until someone proves the anon whale with 5 supply is actually team member really isnt it lol
359269,hello guys im looking for something and someone adviced me to ask here i would like to know if you guys know a tool that calculate a price impact from a tx hash thank you in advance mates
359270,no unless you have the contracts abi
359271,which protocol a txhash could be for any number of different onchain dexs or tools
359272,im currently looking at this for a pancake swap transaction but it made me think that it could be useful for any blockchain
359273,wont work
359274,because every protocol will have a different set of events andor onchain outputs
359275,all uniswapv2 descendants will have the same outputs but youll have to do a reasonable amount of legwork to make sure this is the case
359276,but in a given trade youll see at least two events a sync event which is the liquidity pool at the end of the trade and a swap event which is the actual inputs and outputs
359277,you can calculate the before and after by looking at what the liquidity pool looked like before the trade then again after and theres enough info in those events to construct it
359278,yep it miss the liquidity pool amount before the trade right not sure of what i say
359279,true
359280,thank you mate
359281,hey guyswhat would be the easiest way to obtain univ3 historical pool states at a large scale hundreds of pools since inception do you know any tool for that official graph seem to work poorly with ticksthanks in advance
359282,unless someone is paying for cardinality you would have to use a paid analytics service
359283,do you know such data provider
359284,i have checked but try flipside crypto
359285,vpepo might also be able to help
359286,thank you sir will checkdo you guys know any liquidity manager who claims to have fair sustainable alpha on dexes providing liquidity or doing mid freq trading not considering flasharbitrage liquidation hunters and mempool scrappers
359287,dont know about easiest but extracting that data from an archive node is fairly straight forward
359288,dune analytics check for mint burn and swap events
359289,but you wont be able to download the data
359290,bitstamp charges inactivity fee 10 eurmonth for users with less than 200 eur in assets balance
359291,lol
359292,they are doing robbery
359293,ridiculous
359294,moving to kraken
359295,oh flipside crypto has a way of querying via apiselect from flipside_prod_dbuniswapv3pool_stats limit 100
359296,trying to enforce the 8020 rule start ups are doing that now with the most popular being brex which has stopped serving small businesses
359298,whats the 8020 rule is it about 80 of income coming from only 20 of users or something like that biggest income coming from small amount of dedicatedrichheavy users
359299,this is more like outright theft
359300,nothing to do with 8020
359301,solend team says that they consulted their vcsinvestors of which stani is one
359302,what does this mean
359303,yeh pareto efficiency
359304,stanikulechov said its a terrible idea this seems fake then
359305,
359306,following this logic they should be charging there larger customers more i reckon they are trying to force them off the platform without doing it outright
359307,taking over one of their accounts sounds sorta outright to me
359308,yeah it really sounds like forcing them off the platform its like either deposit more or leave since we will take your funds via fees in 20 months best case
359309,the way solend is handling is pretty rubbishso proposal 2 doesnt 100 guarantee that proposal 1 could come into effectfor all we know proposal 3 might cancel proposal 2 if we see btc sub20k again lol
359310,well technically they could consult and not listen to their vcs and investors lol
359311,exterra employees are banned from leaving south korea
359312,wow this is bad they are getting like p2p company employee treatment in china
359317,pretty much every country bans people from leaving when they are under investigation so that seems normal very much indicative though that sk thinks shady stuff when on
359318,there was never any transparency who the counter party of the btc dump and luna purchase trades by lfg were right
359319,also one interesting thing is this guy marks on his profile that hes bitcoiner since 2008and hes working for luna lol
359320,hey everyone just made this dashboard on nounsnounsdao thought it may have some of you interested
359321,i made something for work and thought it was worth sharing for founders out there dai not being able to market is something i ponder about they have so much selling point and a strong track record the mim frenzy late 2021 they still kept good engagement rates after that while usdn an algorithmic stablecoin had high engagement rates before 2021 algorithmic stablecoins such as usdd and uxd picked up the past for q2 2022 overcollateralized stablecoins fei dai should work based on what algorithmic stablecoins did when it comes to marketing to be able to sell the idea of an undercollateralized stablecoin you need top tier marketing and their engagement rates proves that mim should probably just review its content strategy and focus on its strenghts
359322,after zooming out what about zooming in c ladies and gentlemen q2 2022
359323,all rt posts were excluded as their engagement rate is flawed since engagement comes from the stablecoin account and from the person being retweeted
359324,wow thats nice agree that mim is kept quite during 2022 there was a lot of news about them in 2021
359325,mim is quite the funny case it feels like guerilla marketing done on the web similarly to what frog nation did
359326,mim is frog nation tho
359327,curious about this too
359328,yeah when your project spectacularly implodes and theres a whole bunch of intransparent stuff going on as a founder id do my utmost to clear that up to protect my reputation if there wasnt anything shady going on
359329,i thought it was wonderland and that they just partnered with them always thought it was two separate entities x thank you for correcting me
359330,wonderland is also frog nation
359331,all dani rugging stuff same same
359332,maybe devs r genuine but he aint
359333,sesta is great at marketing not sure hes great in building sustainable products
359334,but kinda sad that most stablecoin marketing i see is predatory
359335,he su zhu down kwon they all share the same psycho personality tbh
359336,for reference would be interesting to see ust there as well it was widely labelled as stablecoin during most of the time interval there
359337,they all great at talking bullshit that public just absorb
359338,i dont think that adoption will come if marketing is still used in a predatory way were literally using similar branding to casinos usdd usdn or to cults ust mim while focusing on profitsyield instead of safetyfunctionality
359339,ill add it probably out of curiosity i was making a dashboard to know which stablecoin to monitor for benchmarking purposes as i am working for a stablecoin myself x
359340,ust was probably an excellent benchmark while it lasted
359341,because crypto is just giant casino at this point of time world is driven by marketing in every field have you noticed massive quality reduction even in some quality brands switch to minimalistic design so it fits everyone no special characters is now valued all same and marketing is what drives sales
359342,and i cant see myself working doing what ust and terra did when it comes to marketing tldr i dont want to learn the evil way of doing marketing for stables lol
359343,true i still remember when flat design became a thing x logos were 3d and hard to use for multiple supports x
359344,and everything after the failure of dedicated cycle of pump and dumping algorithmic stable coins which all died like basis cash and forks
359345,we had the entire cycle for such crap that put them all into death spiral and even after that people believed in ust and luna blows my mind how stupid herd is
359346,youd be surprised how deceitful they have been talking about collateralizing their stablecoin displaying ust as usd on some terra protocols i see you alice or even not fully presenting the risks uxd is algorithmic as well yet they clearly state that if their insurance fund goes to 0 and funding rates are negative theyre rekt this kind of transparency is important if ust clearly explained the risk and didnt try to sell the idea that it was in fact usd but with yield we wouldnt have so much retail rekt in that death spirale
359347,people bought luna when supply was going into the trillions
359348,you think that is the reason retail got rekt
359349,retail would get rekt anyway with luna or without it imo
359350,retail is not the degen that knows nothing and just want to ape to become a billionaire overnight the retail that is important to consider ethically speaking is the average joe who just wants to face inflation and who has invested in ust because of the stablecoin label
359351,i think i had to make distinction as both can be considered retail because of their size
359352,is willful ignorance however genuine the ignorance supposedly is an excuse for putting your money into random stuff
359353,kinda funny how this apparently ever innocent retail is somehow always able to do research after they rekt but somehow never before they put money into some contract people unironically think theyre entitled to riskfree profitmaking endeavors because they refuse or cant be bothered to read
359354,i just think that one being at fault doesnt mean the other is innocent otherwise lets make the biggest scams market them to retail as the safest investment and blame retail for aping
359355,scams dont get anywhere if no one puts money into them
359356,you want a concrete example heres usdds tweet with the most engagement
359357,overcollateralized theyre selling their stablecoin as overcollateralized while using the dual token model god i want to slap myself so hard for reading that
359358,this is where marketing kicks in brandolini law in action
359359,retail when luna was going up stay poor if you criticize luna retail when the bottom fell out help me im innocent
359360,nothing gets coiner going quite like retail
359361,yessir
359362,this is a stupid argument lunaust were marketed as reasonably safe investments saying retail should have done dd makes no sense when the biggest firms got caught pants down in the shit show
359364,yes they all shilled it as low risk yield
359365,this is as dumb as claiming theranos was legit because it got vc money
359366,exactly they were both large caps shilled by the biggest names in our industry trying to blame retail for getting caught in misleading marketing and institutionalized shilling of a stable coin with a dangerous mechanism is completely missing the point
359367,this is not dumb new fresh money who entered this cycle has very low understanding of fundamentals it usually comes to literally most people on earth that looks for someone who is better in the field for review
359368,theranos fooled everyone and supposedly smart institutions for the longest of time its the point were making
359369,loading jordan peterson personal responsibility 50 conplete
359370,thats not the argument the argument is big reputable for retail figures of the space shilled it intensively you have an influencer with a quarter million people following who said its riskfree and its only one case among the others as llama said you cant expect retail to do dd if you want adoption
359371,and it was presented as low risk yield from people whom others considered as professionals etc not saying its right but thats just how things works
359372,imagine having to go to your bank and ask them for their income statement and balance sheet before opening an account
359373,if you check my messages i never talked about luna buyers only ust buyers hence the bank comparison
359374,unbank the banked ust afterlife motto
359375,it was literally marketed as better savings ffs
359376,whos arguing against who here im confused everyone is guilty
359377,i dont see the point of wanting adoption from people that clearly have no use for crypto aside from using them as fodder to pump peoples bags but i suppose we shouldnt say the quiet part out loud
359378,same shit with cashio just tryna beat inflation
359379,not have fun staying poor type ppl
359380,but this is how adoption happens new people joining the ones who wants to stay they learn some hard way
359382,should people do research when they are presented with a 20 apr which is being sold as low risk sureshould we expect industry leaders and builders to create sound protocols and our thot leaders not to shill dangerous investments to clueless masses also yes
359383,should we expect projects to not appeal to snake oil salesman tactics to drive adoption to risky financial products from an uneducated target audience also yes
359384,and yet there were people criticizing theranos from the start just like luna people sell crypto as be your own bank control your money and all that storytelling yet start crying when faced with the reality of actually doing thatwhen people stop pretending retail are innocent toddlers that are simultaneously old enough to buy into these things and also too young to make their own decisions and bear the consequences maybe this place will get somewhere
359385,i want to see enough legit defi projects with risk low enough that i can onboard my mother whos financially illiterate
359386,my mom still doesnt have a wallet yet but i hope to be able to proudly onboard her in the future
359387,thats the defi future i want
359388,i cant onboard my mom to computer let alone to crypto
359389,lol
359390,haha mine is curious enough as shes wondering what i do all day staying at home lol
359391,feels like trying to onboard someone to torrenting when they cant figure out a web browser
359392,i bet you i can get my mom to download torrents safely in 1 day lets admit it crypto ux is the worst
359393,ui is not better tbh its a combo that makes it painful
359394,i mean im still slinging shitcoins using the same metamask
359395,when she downloads malware and gets rekt for it would you propose the torrenting space change to suit her
359396,tell me you want crypto to be a piracylike space without telling me that you want it
359397,not sure why you think im being subtle
359398,lets agree to disagree coming from a third world country i dont see this as only a mean to make money but to save money in a more efficient manner
359399,but i would expect people that introduces her to torrenting educate her that it is a possibility and what she should do to protect herself
359400,no i dont think most people have any business with crypto the vast majority of people are completely uninterested unprepared and unwilling in bearing the consequences of using it on its own terms
359401,they are served sufficiently by what they use already that doesnt make crypto useless anymore than the success of streaming services makes torrenting a failure
359402,crypto will be regulated whether you want it or not it would be better if we selfregulate by focusing on ethical aspects and calling out scams
359403,im hearing this since i joined in 2017
359404,you cant expect people who lacks basic financial literacy to suddenly come and learn everything when a lot of the knowledge is just not accessible in that case the collective who understands the risk has to take steps to make sure that they actually learn what they need to
359405,yellen talked about ust after the collapse and the need to regulate stablecoins
359406,were also paying the price for our silence
359407,oh itll be regulated alright that much is clear we already have a fantastic example of the sort of regulation needed to cater to retail and keep them retail fun times ahead
359409,has self regulation of anything ever worked
359410,its like an ouroboros we need some kind of discipline but i dont think self regulation works or scales then with regulation we converge at the same problems regulatory caputre abuse of power etc
359411,well the canonical example is hollywood
359412,this didnt age well
359413,how so
359414,interesting if you want to break that down they cant enforce anything and their remit is just code of conduct ie harvery weistein bill cosby still went to jail also crypto is also money so i would expect the bar to be higher
359415,it seems like people kind of misunderstand who the average retail user is as well if youre hopping in to telegramdiscord and yelling at people to stay poor tbh thats not exactly what i consider to be retail retail users are the ones who are most likely to look through your website or reviews from different news outlets etc rather than venture on to telegram etc and in this case the information that is largely out there and available is a much more romantic positives only
359416,most of those people dont know who the figureheads are and why should they do they stan or follow the twitter of the owner of their bank too no
359417,it didnt
359418,reading is hard
359419,thats what i said a bit higher and weve been talking using that definition
359420,why are you embittered lets keep discussion cordial no
359421,i think a big difference is before when someone had financial services they had a bank forms contracts explanations if the average retail user cant just find the documents page and do some similar research into their own investments i mean
359422,banks are obligated by regulation to present things in a specific way very clearly you cant tell me the same explanations and information is made available in most of these crypto projects
359423,i mean their il protection mechanism is now turn it off in a bear and turn it back on in a bull that lowers the efficacy and message of their protocol i just dont think theres any way out of il when youre lping somebody has to eat the costs cant just mint your way out
359424,most as in i havent found documentation errors on any cornerstone defi projects if retail cant find fishsandwichswap docs idk
359425,if you cant find that information then why dont you simply not put your money in
359426,yes i agree this is who retail is
359427,are you really trying to say that each project has done their utmost to clearly communicate the risks if so many people are getting rekt then there is a problem and most of that is to do with the messaging not getting across
359428,in reference to ape then ask questions later or where is your documents page thank you
359429,likewise rather than just going hurr durr u got rekt why not just make an effort to recognize that there is an actual issue with regards to how this is communicated to begin with lol
359430,again i think were talking about two entirely different things and even with the documentation it is still up to people to present potential risks and not gloss it over like haha no problems here the future of finance etc
359431,speaking of communication you could argue that the way do kwon publicly guaranteed the peg falls foul of finance law you arent allowed to guarantee returns
359432,i totally side with you here maybe we should have a certification dao with a set norm similarly to what iso does and a clear framework
359433,are we really talking about communication issues for the riskiest and most speculative assets on the planet how about people are well aware and just play roulette with their money willingly
359434,sure like i told you at the start i dont care one way or the other about bancor my only point of replying was to point out that they did in fact talk about how the economics works both ways which can be criticized saying or implying they didnt when its right there in the spec is just strange
359435,thats what i am trying to point out
359436,fuckiing hilarious
359437,flo code is not law
359438,i mean if you think youre entitled to riskfree profit making because you saw marketing somewhere then good luck
359439,its about seeing beyond the horizon and preparing for the future you might not like it but this is what the future of france is going to look like
359440,if you think what do i think pls feel free to let me know
359441,might as well give me your money because im offering an exclusive keypass to atlantis for a discount price of 50 eth
359442,please dm ser
359443,i am looking to deploy capital to sure things
359444,if you cant figure out how a simple hey heres a profit making thing but also heres the risks involved couldnt be useful then idk what to tell you at this point except that youre kind of part of the problem
359445,yeah and you can legally be sued the guy who gave you money is at fault but youll see that youre also at fault when court date arrives
359446,hey man stop baby sitting nubs
359447,again if you cant find that information then why dont you simply not put your money in what do you think will happen if you do not put your money into the latest hyped thing
359448,and that has happened already in defi this conversation is getting a bit circular
359449,the point is that information should be made available up front
359450,is there some sort of shinigami i dont know about that goes around killing people if they dont fomo
359451,ser the people are retarded other people can take advantage everyone is wrong
359452,once again tell me why crypto should be held to a different standard by not disclosing risks and being allowed to only disclose the positives
359453,errr body need to let nubs take care of their own finances stop trying to be the new middleman
359454,youre right my mistake suzu said it all and we already made all our pointsif some of yall love unethical defi practices you do you
359455,sorry ser
359456,its all just tiresome can we all just agree shake hands and go touch grass
359457,sorry ser im stuck in bed for a few days pls double touch for me
359458,too true lol when straitjacket dao
359459,nan
359460,gm beautiful people stay grounded we are going to look back and this will be a tiny blip on the radar
359461,good morning 3 we dont look at prices here lol
359462,
359463,joseph and justincbram
359464,congrats guys
359465,thank you sir
359466,wen token
359468,balance54 i have been spending some time digging through the santiment api and wanted to understand what the slug meant for the network profit api getmetricmetric network_profit_loss timeseriesdata slug santiment from 20210101t000000z to 20210201t000000z interval 1d datetime value here it is santiment but from the available assets metric3a2022network_profit_loss22207b0a20202020metadata207b0a202020202020availableslugs0a202020207d0a20207d0a7d0a it is not clear is these are from protocols exchanges or tokens
359469,also sanbase2 is resisting the manly urge to rewrite it in rust
359470,dont want to spam but reading the discussion about lunaterra i consider myself pretty educated in the crypto space i had largely ignored luna eventually in february i decided ok time to look at it it was nearly impossible to figure out how it worked i gave up what was interesting too me was that when it blew up suddenly lots of information on how it worked i was like this will be a death spiral i mean duh interesting for me was i did think 3ac and jump would bail them out remember when terra dropped to 30c or something then rebounded to 90c tldr the explanation of how it worked seemed to me to be obscured the fact that jump 3ac etc were involved definitely gave it credibility the rest is history enron theranos were the same its happened before and will happen again not a crypto problem just that this happened in crypto it happens in all industries
359471,
359472,posting this here due to the unusually short notice but there is a difficulty bomb delay hard fork planned for next week upgrade your nodes
359474,gl chief u r big brains chads lfgggg
359475,yeah same thing happened when i looked at ohm it made no sense and the documentation seemed purposely confusing i pointed that out and everyone basically just said youre too dumb to understand it its not the projects job to explain it to idiots def reaffirmed that if documentation is purposely confusing dont invest even when everyone apes in with the thesis of its so giga brain i just dont understand it
359476,in ohm the documentation clearly states that every ohm is backed by 1 dai and anything over 1 dai is considered premium who had eyes to see saw
359477,yeah but they also obfuscated that with dozens of pages of 33 meme being the future of money a totally pointless rebasing mechanism etc i agree with you thats exactly what i saw and thats why i didnt buy it but wild that the community didnt call that out more
359478,from my readings of alot of people impacted it came down to moral hazard i would argue there is a lot of fancy language but you can pretty clearly read through it experiment with small amounts of money to understand itno way itll come unpegged curve has so much liqanchor is lowering yield and itll be sustainablethere will eventually be a method of redeeming btc for ust even if it become unpegged there are vcs backing it they have so much money wrapped up in it how could they let it faileven if they fail lfg will sell btc other holdings to save it and theres billions how could it go wrong even if it becomes unpegged you can just swap to luna and its unlikely both mcs will converge because tfl will have calmed the panic
359479,it feels like in a bull market the strongest meme wins
359480,i guess id argue its the most misleading marketing that wins but its probably a potato situation
359481,memes are most probably the strongest form of marketing
359482,celsius was more traditional marketing based no
359483,i worked with an agency for the whole duration of the bullrun and indeed a meme can make wonders
359484,will be interested to see case studies on how much impact memes have on project engagement
359485,sers a bit too random now
359486,not seeing the convo point
359487,if you build a community identity through a meme frog nation ohmies etc that can literally guarantee success in a bullrun regardless of what are you selling
359488,marketingcommunity memetics
359490,nouveaux flat earthers lets please not do this here
359491,cause meme is basically a mind virusmalware with a maximum possible virality definitely agree here sir
359492,the dying man 137 terrabytes of telegram leaks story was more entertaining tbh
359493,my no coiner friends were convinced it had to be real when was the deadline again
359494,4chanvirtually no moderation
359495,on the other hand in bear market it wont work well
359496,its all fun and games happy thoughts good vibes when the numba is going up until the bottom falls out
359497,for comp lenders morpho is built on top of it they starting out their lm
359499,not to reawaken an old chat but the way i was taught to invest was diversify your money in the snp 500 and come back in 30 years as a millionairecrypto was the same but a few more percentage points if i put it in luna there is an idea that putting your money in an investment makes it magically multiply with no effort for the rest of ever as long as retail is educated this way we cant expect them to read into a project it goes against their perception of passive income just my 2 cents
359500,sure not gifting btc in this market
359501,or any market coe to think
359502,uk government backtracks on unhosted wallet data collection proposal link
359503,
359504,does it help
359505,
359506,its only been a week
359507,basically hey community u are still not able to touch your assets and we also are pausing all comms with you so we can focus finding where is 90 of your money but we are gucci so no worries fam we got you

359510,ah good q alex3pg who made it
359512,rekt twitter
359513,wallet tracker i mean buddy
359515,defillama
359516,debank
359518,they dont have portfolio tracker
359519,i have a big list of portfolio trackers here that might help
359520,debank is multichain
359522,bloodstone is a lifesteal item
359523,where can i see newly pair created for erc20 is there any service that shows all pairs created
359524,pairs where
359525,uniswap
359526,v2 v3
359527,anyhow you can probably attach to the calls in any service like openzeppelin defender hal tenderly notifications
359528,to the pool creation calls
359531,we ll fix it in a few days
359532,hey guys i remember there was a list of problems that are needed to be solved in defi can anyone send that list would appreciate it cant seem to find it
359533,this one
359534,also related
359535,there are thousands every day
359536,if you need real time you need to intercept events direct from a node
359537,otherwise use something like graph protocol
359538,dunno how quick you need it but if just for info theres tg channels eg
359539,guys where can i find charts and analytics about dapps development trends and web3 developer ramp up to support that development any source
359540,i think electric capital might have some resources like this they are who does a regular report on development in the space that i am aware of
359541,you are a star thanks
359542,
359543,interesting thread
359544,dunno if true
359546,well self regulation in hollywood applies to censorship and content of the film and to a certain extent it applied to the business side too until the 1960s when supreme court decided that studios cant own theatres self regulation doesnt mean all crimes will be dealt by the self regulating body harvey weinsteinbill cosby committed crimes and got punished for it self regulation for defi doesnt mean the space has to be the judge jury and executioner whenever any participants in the space tows the line atleast i hope not i think self regulation in defi can take the form of similar code of conduct to ensure smoother integration with tradfi and guidelines to prevent protocols from imploding on themselves
359547,there was a second resolution that overturned the first one
359548,i made a new curve pool called deployed gauge and am stuck in ui anyone made a curve pool with noncrv incentives know what i need to do to add incentives posted in curve discord but no reply yet
359549,which part
359550,hello can anyone help me with eip 170 max code size 24576
359551,how did opensea deploy with higher limit 46979
359552,
359553,lol its 2022 and we still have oracle issues
359554,there are no issues in the above context
359555,but yes oracles are f critical
359559,erm convo bots go away
359561,marvin is a bot sers
359562,i concur
359563,hmm issues maybe not standards maybe yes and in the end miners made the most of it like why do we even bother trading we shouldve just mine
359564,
359565,which brings me to a little conspiracy im running in my head that the whole defi summer food farm core ohm algostables bonanza was primarily build by the miners to increase volumes and mevs to make mining a much more lucrative business
359566,use optimizer in compiler settings
359567,thanks it was an exception nothing to do with code size
359581,fixed
359582,all good
359583,and also it could have been but was lucky that it had devs report the issue
359584,still
359585,maybes dont count
359586,

359589,big balls launching now zeframl gl
359590,thanks bb
359591,i dont expect a lot of usage off the bat but feels great to finally launch
359592,good starting point for partnerships etc
359601,how the hell do you reset a eth transaction d
359602,send 0 eth to yourself and indicate nonce of the first lagging transaction nonce
359603,for that just raise the gas price of the tx if its still valid
359604,after one hour uniswap transaction is not valid
359605,if only its not some completely dead shitcoin
359606,no it was legit
359607,yeah i cant find the trx hashs
359608,has ethereum ever stopped producing blocks during the ddos attacks in 2016 did it actually slow down block production or just make it nearly impossible to get into a block
359609,if any marketing manager sees this use gleam or similar product for your giveaways been researching the topic and it seems to yield better results because of additional entries
359610,i guess bankless havent heard about whats happening bancor yet
359611,nan
359612,say you wanted to go into smart contract development which languages would you learn first
359613,js solidity python
359614,
359615,just graduated high school i want to selflearn programming this summer
359616,thank you
359617,dont buy courses if you have the time try this
359618,thank you my friend recommended freecodecamp and udemy too for getting started
359619,has anyone heard rumours of coinbase filing for ch11
359620,lobsterdao nftnyc meet up
359621,any clue on what uniswap hayden are teasinghinting at here
359622,uniswap chain
359623,hahaha
359625,i wouldnt trust rumors coinbase ipod at a peak thats a lot of they ended lending at the next peak
359626,yeah i dont trust rumors but would be great to know their overall financial position after their nft fail and the market crash
359627,this is token terminal
359628,i dont think they track every pools and pools from other chains
359629,well it takes years to farm most of crv so it makes more sense to calculate pe of vecrv plus most circulating crv locked into vecrv
359630,
359631,yes ser
359632,uni rollup and we could have eth fees collecting
359633,seems like staking no
359634,with the 33 ish meme
359635,can you do a limit order on 1inch with stop losses or any other dexes you can do that what are the associated risks
359636,hi guys looking for a suggestion about governance and dao tooling should have vote fund transfer funcationity and can be extend the functionality by devs any good suggestions so far i know daohaus and aragon thanks
359637,not on 1inch not sure about other dexes
359638,utopia labs check google twitter likely what you need if you are referring to a usable interface for the main functions a dao usually does for all other complex things just custom txs in gnosis safe
359639,thanks seems daohaus is old school now
359640,dao haus is very hard to use
359641,imo
359642,bureaucracy governance process
359643,i give up soon after trying daohaus
359644,tried last generation dao tooling aragon daohaus etc they are all very hard to use imo due to lack of real use cases
359645,it is like they made up abt how dao should run bullish on next gen dao tools
359646,use snapshot gnosis safe llamapay or their alternative separately is easier than one tool for all functions
359648,gnosis safe for treasury snapshot for voting dework or similar tools for taskdiscord for communication seems to be a viable way for daos now
359649,seems yes
359650,oh i just found this doc and looking in to it
359651,thanks for the help casslin raccoonchan
359653,etherscan is down
359654,so seems dextools
359655,
359656,cloudflare is dead
359657,rugged again
359658,lol
359659,damn straight nginx 500 error wasnt expecting that
359660,many websites down damn
359661,gm all cloudflare websites are down
359662,goodbye web3
359663,is this related to ddos attack that happened on them someday back as well
359664,most probably not
359666,that attack was something that cloudflare could handle if there is indeed an attack that brought down the whole network then it has to be magnitudes larger than that but a previous outage like this was a configuration error on cloudflares own infra rather than an attack
359667,uhh okay okayyeah i was assuming this time the attack was much larger
359668,the intern fault
359669,nan
359670,seems like it is not an attac
359671,thats cloudflares cto btw
359672,anyone recommend fastly instead
359673,cloudflare issue resolved it seems
359674,think you can do it on matcha
359675,
359676,arbitrum odyssey has begun i found this dune analytics dashboard that shows which dapp is being used the most if you use the dapp that is used the most you are eligible for an arbitrum nft which might reward you with an airdrop
359677,this is just bridges not dapps
359678,nan
359679,definitely doesnt look like a pr fiasco
359680,nothing sus here very natural
359681,why open sea so slow to delete dis
359686,thevovj mostly retarded people doing retarded stuff i can probably find a link to nazi in your surname as well if i try hard enough redacted this bayc nazi stuff
359687,if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck
359688,i just wanna hear peoples opinion about it fuds investigation
359689,opinions on fud are not interesting because they are convoluted tinfoil dramas you can discuss this in lobsterdao kingdom but here it would be meh cheers
359690,is there a way using which suspicious transactions can be marked within the mempool
359691,ftxcloudflare is experiencing an outage and so ftx and many other sites are going to be hard to access for many users ftx markets are in postonly mode link
359692,pay to fud i like this new primitive
359693,how to make a token holder snapshot for nft collection launched on opensea
359695,
359696,interesting dao liquidation in progress courtesy of dcf
359697,
359698,learn more about dovs
359699,gm please recommend nft chats discord telegram to ask a question about nft tokenomics besides nft_avenue
359700,didnt they also got blown up past couple weeks
359701,never profit only d
359702,nan
359703,nan
359705,lmao
359706,more like reinsurance for mm
359710,hi all at defi teller defitellerguru were writing a big article about 3ac where we try to unravel in detail the tangle of consequences of their likely insolvency which is unfolding and probably will continue to unfold therefore we are collecting comments from projects that are somehow experiencing difficulties or expect difficulties in the near future related to this situation in general any of your comments will be helpful and if there is anyone here who would like to directly participate in the making of the material share information and analysis of the movement on the addresses of the actors involved you are more than welcomewe guarantee of course that any interaction with us can remain confidential if the person wishes
359711,would love to see a table dashboard with current debts for 3ac crypto projects other businesses
359712,nice content on the website should be on the roadmap for new comers in defi do you guys have a gitcoin
359713,not yet but thank you very much we will soon have it at this point were trying to get ourselves visible to the community any tips and support would be appreciated
359714,its surprisingly comprehensive could be the base for a defi wikipedia congrats maybe look into wikipedia contributors sentinel model for content maintenance
359715,thank you thats great actually
359716,
359717,v much sounds like plugging 3ac gap
359718,if blockfi couldnt make money in a bull market what good is that 250m theyre delaying the inevitable
359719,imo all these cefi organizations are dead long term
359720,they are going to be regulated into the earth after what happened wasnt blockfi already getting fined or something by the states in the us
359721,i think it was this
359722,coinbase binance ftx will probably survive
359723,yeah but after what cel pulled i dont see how this kind of business model survives in the future
359724,oh sure just bear in mind cel blockfi arent bluechip not convinced ftx is just perhaps too big to fail
359725,those are primarily exchanges though im talking about someone taking your tokens and then leveraging up to the tits
359726,fair enough
359727,i just dont get how all these crypto companies coinbase included are doing so poorly like obviously you can expect a did in volume but we had a two year bull run they should be flush with cash
359728,i think it was just terrible planning you have more money than ever coming in and need to figure out what to do with it seems like coinbase and cryptocom spent it for fun while ftx and binance were the only ones who planned ahead
359729,i suppose thats probably what happened but theyre the house i just dont understand how the house loses and also where 600 million went for coinbases nft platform
359730,wtf they spent 600m on the nft platform thats f ing insane
359731,that just doesnt sound right
359732,i dont even believe 30m was spent
359733,that is what ive heard i should clarify i do not know if that is the official figure
359734,like any other big company they hire too many useless workers and also pays themselves huge salaries also their nft marketplace costed some ridiculous amount of money to develop while they launched it after nfts blown up
359735,ads partnerships during bull market are costly
359736,
359737,and shitton of other stuff you can waste money on
359738,it might even be audio money
359739,what is the proof they got the money
359740,just a tweet
359741,too many shady shit in this space
359742,
359743,this they were planning to add 2000 employees this year their revenue is 100 in crypto as well so those 05 trading fees were worth a lot more last year compared to today
359744,solanabased nft marketplace magic eden raises 130m reaching 16 billion valuation link unfolded
359745,speaking of nft marketplace and yuge money
359746,are there any useful research or reports that indicate how much evmcompatible traffic goes through infura vs quicknodemoralisalchemy et al
359747,over 600m unbelievable they shouldve made a front end for opensea and called it a day lol
359748,theyre all greedy
359751,what am i supposed to understand from this
359753,are blockchains decentralized new trail of bits research report examinesarticle comments
359754,
359755,cant believe they got darpa to pay for this a quick google search shows you 50 of l1 nodes run on aws
359756,it takes more than a 5 second google search to determinefor a blockchain to be optimally distributed there must be a socalled sybil cost there is currently no known way to implement sybil costs in a permissionless blockchain like bitcoin or ethereum without employing a centralized trusted third party ttp until a mechanism for enforcing sybil costs without a ttp is discovered it will be almost impossible for permissionless blockchains to achieve satisfactory decentralization
359758,
359759,lil governance discussion starcraft
359760,no more than a sample from the entire population of society can provide
359763,does anyone know of a list of defi native funds
359764,like cotrader multichain set protocol enzyme you mean those
359765,i mean more like dialectic wintermute etc so funds that do defi strategies
359766,maybe defi native is not the right phrase
359768,what you mean by native fund
359769,only invested in defi before
359770,hedge funds with defi as their primary focus
359771,no just doing mostly defi
359779,hello guys ill make research about aave and maybe whos of us can tell me where i can find his income fees for 30 days and 60 days ill be very pleasure for this help
359780,
359781,in this site i found only 7 days
359782,but i need 30 and 60 days
359783,if you want something quick change the date on crypto fees and add up the 4 values
359784,good idea but if you know of sites that can help me i would be happy to use them
359785,they often change their focus a lot swing with the narratives some stay but i would urge you to think why you are wondering about this basically tldr dialectic wintermute maven11 1kx memyselfandi daedalus guys etc
359786,hey guys can someone give me information about bayc roadmap 1020 with dates and any goals already filled i saw the picture on twitter but with no dates i researching information right now for my project thanks
359787,
359788,opensea vs uniswap i like
359789,how we can use more than 1 eoa in script i am using 2 eoa in script and provided two private keys associated with those account in script cli like forge script scripttokenssolcontractscript rpcurl rpc_url privatekeys private_key_1 private_key_2 broadcast vvvv its failing with errorerror 0 no associated wallet for addresses eoa2 unlocked wallets eoa1location clisrcoptsmulti_walletrs230
359790,prob easier to write your own jsts script than attempt to modify forge to work with more than 1 pk
359791,oh interesting os took gem uniswap takes genie
359792,let the vc bags fight uni is cuter tho
359793,yep yep
359794,so is uni gonna become the looks of genie
359795,
359796,wait what not sure i understood uni acquired genie like opensea acquired gem looksrare is more like an opensea in that comparison
359797,i think he is referring to becoming the incentive token of the nft exchange
359798,yeah this
359799,does genie take a cut from trading fees
359800,well uni is a few levels bigger than genie which is a semi fork of gem but who cares at this point i guess
359801,
359802,nan
359803,they dont have a feeling that will change
359804,announcement for the kilnropstenrinkeby deprecation time to move to goerli or sepolia
359805,i thought genie came out first as compared to gem
359806,dev team creators left for unknown reasons idk who has faith on their side i am just subjectively aware of one side being kinda arrogant and the other one humble u do u
359807,its all vasa
359808,thats what matters
359809,this is a better question for nft avenue but the short answer is there arent dates attached to the roadmap and they arent promising to hit targets in any particular order
359810,hmm interesting that uni swap acquired an aggregator instead of building a market
359811,sorry asked in wrong group
359812,yeah genie feels more like a public good
359813,since when what
359814,uniswap labs btw not the protocol
359815,how do i put it its like genie doesnt charge a fee and its basically free for you to use maybe more like a charity insteadsince its an aggregator it cant really direct the fees to uniswap labs either unless uniswap labs built their own market
359816,stick a fee on top metamask did it
359817,wait what again the fee can easily be switched on and probably will be and did you forget about gem
359818,old pic but still relevant
359820,maybe not so relevant with the new opensea
359821,very surprised at usdds marketing capabilities
359822,these guys are monsters
359823,genie mostly lost to gem opensea optimized smart contracts making genie less valuable nft market down badly with no visible uptrend genie wasnt taking fees genie fired several people from the team week agothat must be a really good deal for uniswap to buy great product and core team probably 150m
359824,couldnt find if genie raised before if its bootstrapped and not taking fees maybe they actually ran out of cash
359825,that val would be a good deal for the other side too tbh just a half of gem if i remember correctly if that is the case ggwp to scott for negotiating that
359826,agree it must be good deal for both sides
359827,funfact genie and gem were the same team
359828,cto and others decided to leave due to an unknown reason and start gem
359829,
359830,genie was a wild success they had a closed beta that exploded very quickly and many funds including my team were frothing to invest
359831,to my knowledge they did not close any round of fundraising the round they put together last fall never closedgenie does not take any fees it would be quite difficult for them to do so imo the overwhelming majority of volume is re routed to opensea and its easy for users to bypass any fee if they so wish use genie to identify best price execute on marketplacere public good not sure how this becomes an open credibly neutral tool keen to see how this plays out
359832,finally nftx on uniswap
359833,is it gonna be that tho
359834,pretty sure genie already supports nftx
359835,assuming they just lift it in
359836,nan
359837,openseaviagemgenieoverview
359838,ye nftx team saying genie already support
359839,nan
359840,dune currently doesnt count seaport volume so keep in mind its outdated after 15 june
359841,ge sers are there any decent nft aggregators except genie and gems
359842,well be airdropping usdcusdc how will it work
359843,lans will use its own cash not dao
359844,
359845,gib uniswap treasury to genie users
359846,imo reservoir is the best positioned aggregator to compete w marketplace since you have native liquidity
359847,looking for ones specifically for end users
359848,credibly neutral operators
359849,
359850,levee is built on reservoirs orderbook the team is building out a full fledge consumer app akin to gemgenie
359851,did they closed a round no public info whatsoever
359852,see a possible reply right after that
359853,what does that mean
359854,as of may 1st they did not close a round
359855,under the hood the protocol is run on a decentralized network of opensource indexer nodes that aggregate both offchain and onchain liquidity easy to use readily available and trustminimized reservoirs aggregated orderbook enables innovation across the nft stack from novel sources of liquidity to the next generation of consumerfacing nft products
359856,
359857,do you want to give a disclaimer before you shill portfolio companies
359858,guessing uniswap bought because they think the next big onramp will be through nftsgamefi
359859,reservoir is not a portfolio company of delphi digital
359860,will always give disclaimers
359861,hmm theres a lot of buzzwords in there doing a lot of heavy lifting
359862,however i hope they are one day
359863,whoop my bad then
359864,with regards to nft aggregators i suppose neutrality would be if they didnt also operate a marketplace
359865,then they were in a really weak position to negotiate maybe uniswap even saved them from death considering market conditions deal size can easily be 5075m
359866,or if anyone could operate said marketplace the orderbook is persisted on arweave and the indexer node is open source so in effect you get permissionless operation of the aggregator
359867,the 0x nft feature is a full swap right not an aggregator
359868,i dont understand how an aggregator can be valued that much dealroom is only valued at around 40m and theyve been developing their aggregator since 2012
359869,unless there is a way to monetize that better than web2 aggregators for ecommerce
359870,gotta be to do with user stickyness and team i imagine or uniswap could have copied for much less
359871,it has to do with users as theyre airdropping usdc to retain them
359872,ye makes sense nft and defi audience are surprisingly seperated a lot of nft whales see defi as a ponzi a lot of untapped value in those users if you can convert them overlike pokerstars launching that casino
359873,bold statement from people whose arch nemesis is the screenshot tool
359875,im speculating but they must have their reasons they smarter than me lol
359876,ye works that way as well in my limited sample size of defi users
359877,nft whales is a nonexisting concept to me a whale cant be below 5m lets say net not even liquid worth since you have like 10 collections with items worth enough something at this point lets say you own 3 top collections you got lucky with choosing them avg one item in each is 40 eth you own like 50 in each so 120 total pieces with 50 eth tagthat is literally 6m so you own like 50 punks 50 apes and 50 doodles and you still barely a whalewho the fuck is an nft whale like 10 apes people 5 doodles people a dozen punk sers and the early flipperscollectors like singaling that is literally itfixed my math sorry
359878,i guess if you can move your existing audience into new product category more fees and move a new audience into your existing products you can see value both waysplus nfts are a nice on ramp for retail tbh
359880,thats like saying scratch offs are a good entry to the casino
359881,casino side you get em in by sports betting and convert them to slots
359882,
359883,fixed my math sorry
359885,i dunno i havent done the maths on nft whales just hear the phrase thrown around lol
359886,a lot of nft whales see defi as a ponzithe irony
359887,maybe its just to build speculative value with opensea worth what it is
359888,tbh you need liquidity to be whale nft whales need to attract defi to actual have the liquidity
359889,lol its very common
359890,uni bought genie means this mainchat gonna ducked definft would be a new term cant image someone bought ape then leverage long uni then lendingetc
359892,ye but we got done by ust
359894,the few nft whales are the ones who sold flipped which is frowned upon by nft collectors ironicsome nft investors dislike defi cuz they missed it just salty also ironic
359895,ye but the fact we talk about nft guys like they get scammed by dms and they talk about us like we just ponzi scams shows there is a divide between the two user groups
359897,i still cant wrap my head around how integrating an aggregator makes sense for uni labs maybe they just wanted the team to develop an inhouse nft liquidity protocol or something
359898,someone smarter than me will work it out but right now my assumption is they did the maths saw their user bases dont overlap and deterimined that the users were of high enough value to acquire maybe the team they acquired are really valuable
359899,well nfts are more mainstream than defi for better or worse
359900,thats a good point actually though i always assumed gem was the one with the most user share
359901,talk is cheap you dont need but you too waffling to objectively identify which one is more likely to be a ponzi
359902,neither have to be a ponzi its not like either nfts are ponzis or defi are ponzis both can have value
359903,its an easy way to grow your user base without having to wait for new people to enter the space
359904,has price been announced
359907,eh i think both attracts similar amount of grifters just the grifting skillset required are different nfts are more suited for low tech but high social engagement grifters
359912,the way i see it the jpeg is not the important part of the nfts the community created around it is
359914,i guess its not pure black and white rather a spectrum community is important in defi too
359916,most of the scam mints from what i have seen works on creating that community before for maximum hype
359918,quality
359920,tbh if your right it probably just means nft users are greennew to the space good on ramp for uni
359921,what does quality mean
359922,wtf is this question
359923,its a pretty simple question
359925,
359926,there are no nft rug projects only learning experiences
359930,i heard uniswap v3 issues nft to liquidity providers do they count as nft whales
359931,i own an nft of a whale does that count
359934,i probably disagree because of my mmorpg past but i truly believe in digital ownership its just too bad it didnt go past the 10k pfp
359936,sers kinda blabla harmless but fin
359937,whats this then
359940,no just something nonfactual and as a random convo i only tried to intervene once convo got to smileys nfts are pixels what is quality and so on
359941,im okay with ending the conversation but i think a discussion on what quality actually means for an nft seems like a legitimate topic of conversation
359942,it did
359943,no ser why because that is super subjective and different for everybody we had these convos here and in nft_avenue literally a dozen times is a fork okay do devs need to be vested for 3 yrs does the launch have to be fair etc its all the same really
359944,fair enough
359945,
359946,ve33 20 wars
359947,no tvl no wars
359948,actually i am wrong no huge brr no huge tvl no huge wars
359949,no huge brr but free brr for projects that recieved venfts no need to dilute native governance token just use ve33 for liquidity incentive
359950,ye more so like giving a tool to the ecosystem as a public good really pumo for all of us can be done i guess
359951,ye issa community based dex
359952,dictators and socialism
359953,not irl tho
359954,hey gang trying to explore onchain history of cryptopunks sales and am seeing some conflicting data from opensea and the cryptopunksapp site anybody able to shed any light
359955,punks were created before erc721 standards so opensea will show you transactions of the wrapped versions
359956,and i believe is vice versa but not 100 sure
359957,thanks for chiming in i think os tracks all the standard punks sales too but even if they were combining the lifetime vol of the erc721 wrapped punks thats only about 10k eth i wonder if theyre also somehow tracking the secondary market sales of fractionalized punks via stuff like nftx
359958,is there a standard abbreviation for lending protocols like compound aave etc feels like there are roughly as many different ones as dexes and no good short name
359959,lex
359968,how is coinbase doing poorly they ipod at a peak raking in didnt offer high yields since the fall have lots of venture capital in different projects before ftx firing people is the american way during a downturn they arent japanese im not saying that its a buy i just am waiting for the 2q report which is more than i can say for many exchanges without sec reporting
359969,its a money market
359970,i see that they burned unaudited from 71 b to 61 b from 123121 to 33122
359971,naive question but why did people think covid kills crypto back then
359973,liquidity crisis crypto needs zirp and economic stimulus
359974,without excessive risk profiles and venture capital retail flush with cash crypto markets break it is there solely as a way to absorb an appetite for risk and high demand for tech speculation all of which would have disappeared without qe and zirp in the usa
359975,so people were afraid that qe and zirp stop due to a pandemic why did they think that
359976,ffr was not near 0 when the liquidity crisis happened in march 2020 and qe was nowhere near as crazy treasury markets are the deepest markets in the world you can usually unload hundreds of billions of bills without moving the price20 bps max during march 2020 you could offload 20 million 10 year treasury bills and move the price 100 bps the depth was gone liquidity disappearedwhat happens to crypto in a time like that well makerdao entered shortfall and ethereum grinded to a near halt it doesnt surprise me people thought it was over now we were saved the last 2 years by qe and zirp but that is going away
359977,uhh am i missing something wasnt the makerdao entered shortfall because ethereum grinded to a near halt
359978,yes thats correct you need timely liquidations to avoid shortfall i never said it entered shortfall for any other reason
359979,
359980,grinded to a near halt means gas fees went up dramatically or what do you mean
359981,they just laid off 20 of their staff while one of their closest peers is bailing out the entire space
359983,random but is sizechad a whale
359984,
359985,this seems to be a better version of web3 shill than ceo of a16z
359986,because any economist would say that qe or zirp would only bring non existent demand from the future to economies that would raise trade barriers without the ability to export like in 2008 an economist would say that lockdowns would automatically destroy the economy and massive creation of money supply would only enable the politicians to accelerate the timeline of the greatest depression the demand in an environment that cant increase productivity furthers moral hazard the pandemic created a moment of fud that ended two weeks before lockdowns started because they knew the banks and the federal government had only one choice since they couldnt admit theyre over leveraged themselves crypto didnt know the fed and govt would increase the money supply by more than 30 for weeks before eth and btc recovered
359987,general thoughts on gavin here always seemed like one of the few in the space to still have his reputation intact
359988,either ftx already had more capital before thecoinbase ipo at which point coinbase has captured more market share since then or your perception of coinbase was better than coinbase actually was last year coinbase is only us uk and eu
359989,ftx has made a huge jump into the foray by going global in 3 years while coinbase has been working with making the us politicians happy and their lobbying efforts will help in sustained long term effort for regulation
359990,i mean he describes it eli5 way so even normans can understand which i like
359991,coinbase has no futures no derivatives trading desk etc
359992,ftx biggest profits are extracting value from solana shitcoins rotating them to liquidating derrivs apes otc seems like slowdowned a lot recent years
359993,i meant more in terms of his vision and reputation alot of the original ethereum founders reputations havent exactly fared too well whereas noone seems to speak ill of gavin he also still seems to aspire to the original ethos
359994,not sure if trolling or serious
359995,polkadot performed quite shitty this cycle so not sure about reputation many crypto natives still think its scam lol
359996,on chain governance is nice tho
359997,no troll i swear im interested in general perception i dont mind that polkadot performed poorly id rather they get the tech correct
359998,im a big fan of dotsama btw i like xcmp and i think spree is really unique and in general im a fan of the whole architecture
359999,his reputation jumped off a cliff with polkadot centralization aside there was the frozen eth that they tried to forcefully release
360000,onchain gov is quite easy when you force users to lock up tokens for duration of vote
360001,do you mind expanding on the centralization issue or is this not the right forum for it
360002,on chain governance like voting for short term gains eg trying to push op to be a native gas token thank goodness therell be a citizen house to keep them in check voting for noncryptoethical things eg solend trying to take over someones fundsso many negative examples in just the past month
360003,when you get rid of all the storytelling and cut right to the chase polkadot is yet another dpos chain dpos is 1 token 1 vote but what you get from that is a cartel it might a very nice and friendly cartel but a cartel nonetheless
360004,i mean couldnt you say that about all pos chains theres obviously a spectrum but from all ive seen this is prevalent in all and not an accusation that is unique to dpos
360005,the d in dpos is very much unique to them its the selling point of the entire design theres a difference between cartel by design and maybesomething as far as spectrums go dpos is the end of whatever you assume that spectrum for pos is
360006,havent read this yet but seems relevant
360007,nan
360008,but again these figures are sometimes very misleading
360010,hey guys i remember some websites that could breakdown ethereum transactions but i cant find any atm
360011,damn dystopia doesnt even work if you dont have metamask installed
360012,get the tech correct imo cosmos hub is a superior implementation they have their differences of course but end result the same cosmos was also first with that vision afaik and is way ahead of polkadot in both implementation and adoption
360013,what was the site that helped you add multiple network config to metamask
360014,
360015,mmmm id tend to disagree here the message passing between chains in cosmos is not superior to polkadot imo their lack of a shared security model too couldnt be considered superior cosmos is ahead in adoption for sure but i wouldnt say something as binary as cosmos is superior to polkadot its more nuanced than that also polkadot has data availability built in whereas cosmos has an independent chain for that could be argued thats a pro or a con depending on which side of the fence youre sitting
360016,i mean i guess if you forget about the pedo fud thing
360017,haha i did actually forget about that i take it all back
360018,well it was not really fud he in no uncertain terms accepted he actually wrote the blog post
360019,i mean some people obviously love the weird erotica heres trader joe with their frankly bizarre erotica
360020,this is why we cant have nice things
360021,yeah i dont think both are on the same level a nerds weird kink is a lot different from someone fantasising about kids to spark intellectual debate
360022,thats fair not defending gavin
360023,he broke eth i lost stupid tokens to the parity fuckup i still love gav good buidlr good leader beach_sunglassesjpg
360024,not a pedo btw
360026,
360027,forkless upgrades and message passing under shared security are the real killers
360028,yeah i was super impressed with some of the past upgrades im constantly getting messari updates for cosmos chains that are down and thats not meant to be disrespectful but then when you dive into substrate and the built in upgradeability its just so elegant
360029,nan
360030,nakamoto coefficient of pos chains per latest tob audit done for darpa
360031,the nakamoto coefficient represents the number of validators nodes that would have to collude together to successfully slow down or block any respective blockchain from functioning properly
360032,the analysis is bad
360033,they conflate validators with validator operator here and further conflate direct vs indirect control over constituent operators in the case of pools
360034,yeah not the best approach for sure for example i would argue with the right metrics eth2 would be far more decentralized than solana or avalanche
360035,reads like a report that had a narrative first and then set out to find reasons to justify that narrative
360036,this and the pow analysis were both bad in this regard really superficial analysis of hashrate stakeflow dynamics
360037,being comissioned by the us governmanet could have a little do with it
360038,hey guys heres a list of go to guys from vc funds investing in indian web3
360039,interesting timing with the bis report saying that cbdcs are the future not crypto
360040,you fight a man when hes down
360041,hi guys does anyone have a consolidated launchpad report for 2021 or 2022
360042,what launchpad
360043,binance launchpad or polkastarter platform
360044,and many many more
360045,
360046,cryptorank has probably the most data on ieo and ido platform performances
360047,since launch there have been only 3 decentralized ido platforms with at least 10 sales have averaged a profit for their users
360048,yes but i would like to take a look at a deeper analysis what is the median in of tokens given to platforms by projects what trading volumes and potential commission can be received by the exchange etc
360049,dont think many other places have gatehred this data unfortunately especially for the centralized platforms the profits are probably not shared at all
360050,doubt this info is even publicly available
360051,i think centralized exchanges have the main income in such cases from trading commissions including trading their own token
360052,you would usually not even know the real given in such private deals and price performance also doesnt say much given all assets went down
360053,i think that exchanges dont care about the price of an asset except for commissions from trading the launchpad token and their own theres nothing to earn here my subjective opinion
360054,as we remember the drawn prices for btt ignited fomo among many thereby pushing the demand for bnb after which its trading volume increased significantly
360055,those are meaningless distinctions within the context of the analysis whether or not the control is indirect doesnt change the reality of the number of entities you need to coerce to undertake the attack not to mention the very next page goes into the specifics of how mining pools actually function
360056,of course it changes the reality coercing a mining pool coercing a single legal entity and therefore treating them as equivalent is incorrect
360057,a mining pool is run by a single legal entity
360058,mining pools dont need to be legal entities for one
360059,gavin is a poster boy for wanxiang fenbushi and a few other asian powers he was assigned to dotsama as a second choice i dont know why people in the west are so in love with him
360060,two a mining pool getting captured or closed by a government is not the same thing as a giant miner getting closed down or captured
360061,thats nice doesnt matter the people talked about here have neutered entities with a stronger claim to being nondescript that there may or may not be 500 lemmings that comprise a pool who may run after they realize that the pool is under attack is noise
360062,how is that noise if they actually run and cannot be coerced by the pool to do that which whomever has captured the pool wants them to do it absolutely dilutes the effectiveness of a purported attack
360063,botnets dont stop being botnets and functional because you can remove your device from an attack after you realize whats happening
360064,
360065,
360066,how fast will the constituent miners involved react what percentage will actually react will they actually realize whats going onclaiming they glossed over mining pools when we have discovered that today all of the mining pools we tested either assign a hardcoded password for all accounts or simply do not validate the password provided during authentication for example all viabtc accounts appear to be assigned the password 123 poolin seems not to validate authentication credentials at all slushpool explicitly instructs its users to ignore the password field as it is a legacy stratum protocol parameter that has no use nowadays20 we discovered this by registering multiple accounts with the mining pools and examining their server code when available these three mining pools alone account for roughly 25 of the bitcoin hashrateis in the very next page is dubious
360067,what can you actually do by taking over stratum
360068,maybe you can ddos a pool ok so what
360069,you should read the report their job was to find these things out
360070,ive read the report
360071,its superficial and makes mountains out of molehills
360072,that you think a mining pool being a legal entity or not is remotely relevant certainly adds color to what that conclusion means
360073,thanks for sharing i dont mind centralized servers used for asset hosting and experience an example is better than 1000 words i used to play dofus a french mmorpg and to this day i still have a very rare cosmetic item that i got over 10 years ago i would love seeing those as nfts to facilitate trade back then when i wanted to sell an item for fiat i had to sell it for kamas in game currency find a virtual currency broker okgoods was good back then lol sell my kamas receive the money on paypal
360074,so far all youve done is move goal posts and not understand what the actual implications of this socalled grave passage youve called out are
360075,since i was also in a third world country i needed to transfer my funds from paypal to a family member to finally cash out
360076,huh your claim is they simply glossed over mining pools thats demonstrably untrue
360077,i actually literlaly did not mention mining pools
360078,and referred to validators
360079,you then took that to mean mining pools and i responded specifically with regards to those
360080,they conflate validators with validator operator here and further conflate direct vs indirect control over constituent operators in the case of pools
360081,this and the pow analysis were both bad in this regard really superficial analysis of hashrate stakeflow dynamics
360082,sure
360083,the analysis of hashratestakeflow is superficial its basically not analyzed at alleditok this is incorrect its analyzed in the context of 51 attacks which makes sense since thats where it would mostly apply but it takes for granted the analysis above re locus of power in 3 mining pools and extrapolates from there without accounting for how easily hashrate can flow out
360084,all they say is look mining pools use this really bad p2p software to coordinate and mayb eit could be usedc to ddos them
360085,ok so what
360086,um can you get your story straight you did not talk about mining pools or you did
360087,youre accusing me of moving goalposts surely you shouldnt do that
360088,fun edit lol carry on
360089,i said that the pow analysis was superficial you mentioned mining pools specifically and then i replied about them i think thats pretty clear at this point were just going in circles if you want to add any explanation about how stratum is somehow a giant security hole that would allow someone to take over the 3 hashpools and lead to a 51 attack please do
360090,i didnt quote it to make any point about a 51 attack the report is multipage for a reason i quoted it against the claims that they simply glossed over mining poolsas for going in circles yeah your ninja edit after the fact a case in point that it is your reading of the report that is guilty of being superficial

360098,
360099,ouch
360100,lobsters someone know where i can find system surplus buffer of makerdao contract or smth like this
360101,tried harvest by treehouse
360102,
360103,errr body getting acquired
360104,link
360105,
360106,dont worry the curlyhaired altruist will definitely come to the rescue
360107,voyager digital secures loan from alameda to meet customer liquidity needs
360108,harvesttreehousefinanceconnect
360109,nan
360110,hes playing all of this brilliantly use alameda in the background to liquidate everyones postions and make them go bankrupt then have ftx be the good guy and bail everyone out eventually hell control the entire space
360111,alameda is bailing voyage out not ftx
360112,i know i was recycling a ct joke
360113,
360114,bailing out on paper it would take more than half a year for voyager to be able to borrow these assets they have a huge hole in the bs with 3ac especially not sure how they will recover from that even the might just do this shit until they dump their shares on the market to not have exposure alamedas obligation to provide funding is subject to certain conditions which include no more than us75 million may be drawn down over any rolling 30day period
360115,guys when i can find yfi fees generated per month or maybe 3 month
360116,what happens if voyager calls default on the loan to 3ac do we know how much collateral was provided that they could liquidate
360117,
360118,they are building the next appchain
360119,from starknet to cosmos
360120,but why
360121,for user acquisition
360122,hahaha crypto is such a joke
360123,i believe they were not collateralized
360124,nan
360125,i mean just make it an exchange at this point
360126,guys where can i find how much fees crypto projects earn per month or more time
360127,could we have a rollup connect to ibc
360128,
360129,are there any other sites there are too few coins on this one
360130,try token terminal or there may be some dashboards on dune
360131,ok thanks
360132,just wanna ask how are you planning to treat this information
360133,i hope you are not taking face value
360134,i dont get it cosmos as sett layer and still using starknet or wtf is going on
360135,why
360136,these metrics do not correspond to reality
360137,so thats the issue with doing analysis without the broader picture these metrics are not relevant almost because every protocol has their own inflation model if you see high earnings it might be coming out of huge issuance so then it can even be bots i am not saying most or all are but this drastically influences these questions
360138,does this logic even apply when we speak about defi projects
360139,we are still considering what will happen with the existing v3 system built on starkware the spokesperson said
360140,absolutely applies even more so
360141,thanks bro i have to think about it
360142,
360143,ahh ethereum based l2s currently they operate through central sequencers
360144,makes sense tbh if their roadmap cant wait for starknet to decentralize
360145,thanks
360146,what is the difference between the fully decentralized offchain orderbook and matching engine there and the one they sought to remove here
360147,the fee is not decentralized for sure
360148,hmm so dyd doesnt want starkware
360149,would imagine cosmos is much cheaper than starkware they need their cut right
360150,that would be a validium right the rollup stores your proof of computation and then you make the data for the computation available on the blockchain essentially similar to current starkex architecture just replaced their dac with a cosmos blockchain
360151,dydx frenship with eth maxis over not dot maxis are new best fren
360153,the frontend blocking of americans too im assuming
360154,they claim it and alternatives are inadequate to run the clob dex they want and that the end state is no different from cosmosethereum l1 likely is more decentralized than cosmos at least for the time being but not even close to performant enough to power dydx ethereum based l2s have two issues both they are not close to performant enough to power dydx see offchain decentralized orderbook matching and also currently they operate through central sequencers which have the ability to censor transactions there are solid plans for many l2s to decentralize their sequencer network but likely they would only be decentralized to a point more comparable to what could be achieved with the dydx chain than to ethereum l1
360155,ohm so they will make new token airdrop and exit pump
360156,well at least its muh innovation lets see how ux is
360157,isnt decentralized sequencer an implementation detail rather than a required feature of a zero rollup
360158,its not a required feature of a rollup but it is a desirable one
360159,mainly for scalability and censorship resistance
360160,maybe something we dont know eth network fees on zkrollup is not big centralized sequencer is not a reason
360161,the plan for starknet is to decentralize over time not sure what the timeline is on their side though
360162,id say its a perfectly valid reason censorship resistance in a dex is a pretty real requirement
360163,if i am reading it correctly their orderbook seems to be a bit like a mempool equivalent so the orders and their execution results are stored on the chain but the state created from those orders is inmemory of the validators
360164,compared to their current infrastructure where the orderbook and matching engine is being run only by a single entity who is generating the proof after executing the trades
360165,is a distributed orderbook on a terrabutdifferent chain decentralized
360166,well is any new l1 decentralised
360167,does the centralization get better with time for a cosmos chain
360168,no idea the only tendermint chains i know of are pretty centralized one of them runs from czs backyard
360169,what abt cronos
360170,pretty sure it has less validators than bsc
360171,afaic remember cosmos well their premier chain itself went from a doubledigit number of validators needing to collude to single digit
360172,cosmos eco got rekt hard with lunaust
360173,did luna even have the ibc enabled
360174,i think only the ibs
360175,whats ibs
360176,
360177,but seems like luna had ibc enabled since october and then turned off during the death spiral
360178,u asked
360179,issue was a lot of cosmos dexes had lp pairs to ustluna they also had a 14 day unbonding period for lpers so they got rekt hardthe reason they shut down ibc to terra was because they printed insane amounts of luna and created a cascade which affected dex liquidity as lpers could not inmediately unbond their lp pair
360181,not your chain not your money lol
360182,hey coinbase actually decided to list something good for once scbuergel hopr is getting listed in an hour
360183,
360184,he is shillingggg btw congratz to gearbox
360185,cronos has 27 from last check bnb chain has 21
360186,nan
360187,yeah cronos is proof of authority seems full permissioned same with bnb you have to be an elected validator
360188,they have 40 afaik but 20 or so are elected periodically who can actually propose blocks
360189,heh was just about to ask about thatproof of authority poaa more streamlined and scalable consensus mechanism consensus protocol while still maintaining security with a range of validators that many different parties run
360190,my good friends and i brockshane
360191,yesterday
360192,whats the channel
360193,theyre doing such great work at decentralising im moved to tears
360195,drops_analytics
360196,bnb smart chain will no longer have only 21 validators but will provide more candidates to choose from through the new mechanismachievement unlocked decentralisation
360197,yup they sent a notice to 3ac too
360198,tbh i have always wondered why all of these chains use tendermint instead of developing on substrate substrate seems like the better platform if you want to build a chain on especially if you dont care about being part of the internet of blockchains narrative
360199,they dont have funds the future unlocks from the projects of 3ac gonna drop much
360200,dm me

360269,i wrote an article about engagement rates and stablecoin the topic we talked about last time here to expand on findings can i share

360294,it is nice for anyone who doesnt want to deal with rebasing in their taxes if their tax jurisdiction makes rebasing painful to report
360297,of course generalized research for sure
360298,if you forget your access phrase
360299,can you elaborate why you think substrate is better
360300,golang teams no rust devs
360301,well this is purely from an outsider perspective but the upgradability of substrate as a platform seems pretty sweet if i were developing a blockchain that is for something as specific as dydx to me it seems like that upgradability prospect is a clear winner but i havent really had any handson experience of building a chain with either hence the question
360302,i read your name sunny king and started fanboying for a second lol
360303,
360304,hey are there any protocolsprojects that is working on crypto insurance specifically for validators
360305,eliasimos would likely know best ye there were a few
360306,very interesting about why dydx is going to cosmos
360307,
360308,this is explainning better
360309,saving their token price
360310,the answer is go
360311,it seems that validiums could create legal centralization problems to projects
360312,this is one aspect that i can never really wrap my head around go in my experience becomes harder to work with than rust after a certain size the learning curve of rust may be steep but after a certain size i think projects actually benefit from that complexity of rust than the simplicity of go
360313,possibly but thats viewing it from a developer pov zoom out think of it from a team and company pov
360314,zoom out even more and see that it has always been legal arbitrage
360315,true but anecdotally i think in the blockchain as an industry has a more concentrated pool of rust devs than other industries so using rust shouldnt hypothetically be a blocker for your team but i get your point and maybe there is some statistics out there that completely proves my hypothesis of hiring rust dev being in blockchains wrong
360316,behind every protocol pivot is a lawyer in disguise
360317,this makes sense if you are bearish on people building mining pools to generate zk proofs
360318,well dydx has given a deadline of eoy 2022 dont think we will see any major progress on people mining pools for zk proofs by then
360320,or trying towhat i mean the market will value their current stepits open question if the token value will gain or lose
360321,we will see it but tracking the record of appchain recently appchain is a disgusting thing especially like ronin dfk
360322,well with ibc id assume they hope to interoperate with the larger cosmos community
360323,how is paying validators for proof of stake transaction will accrue value to exchange token
360324,validators are the only traders o dydx
360325,because sentiments and marketing matter more than actual utility
360326,yeah so who cares of validators pay out thats my point
360327,a circle mms got paid by trading rewards staking rewards for getting the trading fees
360328,nexus mutual will be launching one soon unslashed was offering that havent checked in with them more recently

360338,wait i cant post about that
360339,well a message with 50 links didnt seem particularly relevant because we have 5 ecosystems now and if they all post these we will probably die
360340,you can throw a link to an article with that list maybe thats totally okay
360341,unfortunally i think nobody make an article about that but is okay if i found an article in the future will post it here
360342,cool
360343,thank you heres the article i wrote about engagement rates across stablecoins its the continuation of the discussion we had about engagement rates last time let me know what you think about it
360344,
360345,thats actually great for centralized onchain forextether is expending rapidly since usdts marketcap lost 20 what should we understand from this c
360347,hopefully not usdt needs to get new fund into the system to maintain solvency
360350,nan
360351,i saw marusha pointing out on twitter how tether is the backbone of crypto
360352,their position is indeed scary
360353,most cex use them
360354,no clear collateral disclosure
360355,freezable
360356,this can be said of any stablecoin issuer as all fiat can be frozen by design
360357,that last point is always undermined tho idk why opensea banned iranian artists from using its platform what will block tether from doing the same in the future
360358,could you expend on that point please
360359,usdc has freeze options as well for example as well
360360,and have to have this option otherwise their own backing probably gets frozen in the end
360361,for usdc i was aware of that point i totally agree with you they can have their backing frozen if they dont have the option but i think we can separate bank money from cash money which are both fiat bank money is freezable cash isnt are we creating digital cash or a layer2 bank money c
360362,talismanxyz added evm support so did subwalletapp so now there are two good wallets in the polkadot eco which also support evm if you need an alternative or want to trim down your number of extensions
360363,eh tether fud is not anything new no one cares about it that much
360364,yeah glad i exited early because of that free unlocks by the coinowl
360365,hey serge brotherhow are you doing
360366,so this is how finance bros did their research
360367,hey guys im sorry for quite a dumb question but i seem as though i cannot really find the answer for that i am using ledger but a btc segwit account i need to somehow extract my whole account history but singe segwit recieving addresses always change i am not sure how i can use any btc explorer with my segwit btc ledger account can anyone help me with this
360368,he wasnt fudding at all he was actually saying that its too important for crypto to fud
360369,lmao thats how 3ac found their clients kek
360370,the point is not that he was or was not fudding point is tether is like the willtheywontthey romantic pair of a long running sitcom it was exciting when the show started but now its just old and people have lost interest will it be bad for crypto if tether falls yeah pretty bad but nothing more to do until someone definitively proves that tether doesnt have enough assets to back their market cap and even if tether falls it wont be the end a lot of competitors have emerged that can possibly plug a tether shaped whole
360372,lobsters any api service layer that will return the number of users a dapp is having
360375,trust is purely personal preferenceyou can give valid reasons for usdt vs usdc but things can unfold against your expectationjust make sure you trust and dont regret
360378,hey whats the reason for users to not move from dexes uni primarily to aggregators was there a discussion already
360379,it would be understandable if aggregators werent efficient enough to offer better rates
360381,1inch but isnt the positive surplus sent to the treasury
360385,the reason is that the slippage only starts mattering at huge sizes if the size is not huge you might be even overpaying on gas compared to the slippage you save
360386,plus brand recognition stickiness
360388,yea i remember a year ago gas was an issue on aggregators but i guess not anymore unless most of the users are really trading small small size
360390,i mean currently to swap 100eth on 1inch costs 12 vs 5 on uni
360392,i doubt there is retail trading 100 size onchain
360393,exactly
360394,so you dont need aggregation
360395,one pool would give u same

360417,yikes hang in there yall
360418,same for weeks now its been ramping up whats their angleusually attractive female pfp
360419,is it ok to post if youve just launched your project
360420,yeah im almost to the point of just banning any hot chinese female pfp who joins literally every one ends up being a bot
360421,u r not a random so please yes do
360422,thanks
360423,theyre usually subtle shilling various random projects likely scams

360437,people laughed at jesus
360438,even though i think it was sort of a dumb idea i wonder if they were inspired by my posting it
360439,how many times per day the phone shut downs
360440,this guy was the health secretary of the uk a little bit surprised at this speech
360441,
360442,fuck this such a repeat of 2018
360443,fuckk remember htc phone samsung phone iota phone
360444,atleast this time i can tell potential gf the network is down and avoid talking on cell because solanana
360445,jk jk i never step away from desk no potential gf
360446,its a saga get it
360447,i imagine it takes longer than two weeks to plan a cell phone and os launch but maybe so p
360449,they didnt build it in 2 weeks maybe just thought to say they will for now
360450,sirin labs henlo
360451,that feels like huge news to me also validates that more traditionally organized nondao driven orgs will have an advantage launching out there type products i dont see any chance eth could have done that and doesnt matter if it succeeds or not thats a pretty awesome moonshot
360452,wrong chat what are you responding to
360453,solana phone conversation should have responded sry
360454,ah the sirin 30
360455,
360456,il protection still active this is permanent loss we dont protect against that
360457,what their database isnt even working and they are launching phone what in the world i mean
360458,its like samsung would launch a diesel engine car because there is a display from them
360459,lmao what does a phone have to do with a blockchain this validates something about traditionally organized orgs for sure that theyll do stupid things in an attempt to bandwagon or get publicity
360460,it means that if their database starts working and they have a phone thatll be a massie competitive advantage
360461,how is a phone a competitive advantage in the blockchain space
360462,eli5
360463,if their database starts working so their primary area of expertise is broken but theyre going to add a new completely different area of endeavor and you think this is going to have a positive result
360464,abuilt in hardware wallet that integrates natively with point of sales systems for real life payments would be a huge advantage
360465,you can shutdown solana directly from their phone there will be a dedicated button
360466,we have that its called having a crypto debit card attached to apple pay
360467,with what
360468,no one has to take your weird crypto token who the hell outside of the blockchain space even knows what sol is and it works with everyone and you didnt even have to build an entire phone to do it
360469,that only works through centralized entities though if they can built payment infrastructure that circumvents the entire traditional system thatd be excellent
360470,what advantage do you think the phone offers to the people currently using solana
360471,and solana is decentralized
360472,celsius withdrew 2000 ether from bancor and actually got 1200 i am making a snark about how this is permanent loss not impermanent loss so bancor is still working as designed
360473,this is an excellent question forget what the phone offers people who dont use solana for the moment if i am bought into the ecosystem fully what does this do for me
360474,native ability to do crypto tx without really garbage third party apps i hope
360475,what does that mean
360476,so its literally wallet software with a free phone attached
360477,so where is the loss going or why is there such discreptancy
360478,its actually il bnt tanked and couldnt cover the il and they turned off il protection too i think
360479,as in if i wanted to do a tx say at a pos as stephangoss mentioned or a p2p tx or anything else i wouldnt have to jump through fifty hoops to do it
360480,why do you need to produce an entire tiny computer to run a single app
360481,isnt an os literally software attached to a piece of hardware lol this is a nonsensical critique
360482,your phone does everything it does with apps already at best the only thing that changes is the backend which users could not care less about
360483,an os runs more than one application people already make phones with oses on them which can run applications so why do you need to make a phone to run a single app
360484,this argument feels like someone explaining that touch screen phones are dumb and feature phones are just fine
360485,blockchains host more than one application too
360486,i dont get it i can do this on my phone too wait i actually cant because solana isnt functioning
360487,youre basically suggesting that we should move back to feature phones
360488,yeah it does feel like 2008 tbh
360489,a general purpose phone can run whatever app you want including a nonshit wallet app
360490,and you still need pos support for everyone if you go this route
360491,can the ape phone do something my current one cannot will it have a gated access app for which the apk would not work elsewhere
360492,being _able_ to do it with tons of headache vs being able to do it easily and natively is what sets adoption vs obsolescence apart in most software
360493,and people use their phones for much more than just making blockchain transactions no one is sad that they dont have a phone that has native support for making crypto tx
360494,this argument is the same one about sirin and all the brockshane phones before it lets not pretend theres a meaningful leap going on here
360495,can i do everything on it i can do on my current phone or will i need to carry 2 phones will need another phone for the next project to do this
360496,they said its built on android so this would obviously be able to do everything else too
360497,oh come on this is like the meme where someone lists the 20 steps necessary to pay a bill with a check including licking the stamp and putting the stamp on the envelope as separate steps you open an app on your phone and it does blockchain shit what should there be a netflix button on the phone
360498,i feel like there are kneejerk culture war replies here rn not thoughtful commentary tbh
360499,this is thoughtful commentary you havent provided a single reason why having a phone which was optimized in some way to run a blockchain client would be better than any existing phone which can run any app including the same blockchain client
360500,look into the rates of repayment of bills when you dont have to send a check but can instead use a cc via a websiteits 1000 increase or more in debt repaymentso you kind of make the point for me yes
360501,yeah this feels like a solana is dumb therefore everything they do has to be hated by us
360502,the problem here has less to do with the flaws of solana and more to do with selling a phone
360503,lol yeah that was literally my point it doesnt take 20 steps to pay a bill it only takes that many steps if you deliberately name each muscle movement as a step
360504,can you explain for the cheap seats what exactly you gain by having a dedicated phone for this task vs an app that can be launched on any other phone
360505,and remember were talking about android here so you have tons of room to screw around with the os features
360506,what does the hardware need to support that current phones do not
360507,i think it should simplify down into this what can that phone do which mine cant why cant my current do that why is that worth so much
360508,my point is that just because something is possible like paying a bill in a method that is a headache like sending checks doesnt mean it gets done as well as when something is easierso just because an app can go on our phones rn makes it possible to do crypto tx it doesnt get the adoption it could bc its a headacheif a decent os with native implementation combined with a phone with hopefully good hardware security comes out then my point is obvious adoption and usage increases all things equalergo this is a good idea for solana to do and probably useful in general for crypto adoption
360509,what is native implementation in an os
360510,you have just said some words but there is no concrete information here what exactly would be different about an app running on this os vs any existing one
360511,and why do you need to make hardware to do it
360512,idk what they plan to do but i could envisage a number of things that native implementation would look like and would make life easier if im utilizing crypto on a day to day basis
360513,name two
360514,who is the target market solana users
360515,ability to natively tap to send money via solana chain to a friend next to meability to use biometrics to confirm a tx in my native browser to do yield farming
360516,1 can be done today with android2 requires browser support can be done with all current android devices
360517,the use case im most excited about is being able to add addresses and being able to use nft for payment at instore payment terminals just like apple wallet but instead of running through the credit card system it submits and signs a blockchain transaction saves the merchant 3 in credit card fees
360518,i was originally answering someones question of what does someone who is using solana daily get out of this so yeah
360519,name two more
360520,those two sucked
360521,see my earlier points re can already be done being a bad argument if its a headache to do
360522,hell i could launch a wallet app on ios when you tapped it against an nfc tag
360523,so there exists a solana user using an iphone andor samsung is the idea they dump those devices for this
360524,dont think you do can just build an os
360525,no but you havent explained why it needs to be hardware yet the hard parts here are all development users would get the good experience developers have to do the hard work you dont need an entire new device for this
360526,right but it cant process via blockchain
360527,maybe theyd movs to this on their next phone change
360528,sure it could why not metamask exists
360529,doesnt have to but is certainly a very interesting approach that might actually end up having a good ux
360530,why on earth would they do that
360531,why why am i giving up all my apps for this what benefit do i get
360532,ive actually not said or defended that it needs to be hardware if you look back ive talked exclusively about an os and native implementation
360533,its not interesting its just handwaving its an app that launches when you hit an nfc tag the app controls its own experience
360534,not saying hardware is a bad idea either btw i just havent thought about it and its not a natural place for me to have a quick debate with someone
360535,what os level features that do not exist today need to be implemented for this to work properly
360536,it is not hard to customize android os to do tons of things and the user doesnt have to do the customization
360537,all the arguments you are making applies to pretty much every major innovation in the last 20 years
360538,i dont wanna ad hominem here so please dont take it that way but were you around as in an adult when the iphone first came out or when mp3 players came out by chance
360539,not even close to true
360540,yes i was
360541,you dont see the parallels here
360542,this is noise were you around when samsung offered an sdk to interact with ethereum
360543,or maybe you argued the same about them we have walkmen so we dont need mp3 players we have phones with apps like that weird one from tmobile so why do we need an apple app store
360544,of course
360545,the 20 years ago comparisons are dubious there is no leap between phones today and whatever this phone is offering
360546,not noise though i was asking as a genuine question because this seems like the same convo ive had for twenty years with people who are entrenched in their systems
360547,i dont because its obviously not parallelmp3 players enabled something that wasnt possible before optical media had tons of problems so did magnetic media mp3 players had a very easy response to the question im asking you can carry an entire album or more in your pocket and go running without it skipping and you dont have to rewind these were not possible with existing techthe iphone was the first phone to have a browser that actually worked the touchscreen was responsive enough to navigate a web pagethis is just an app
360548,youre not reinventing anything whatever it is theyre supposed to offer is something you can already do
360549,how would you possibly know that its not even launched yet
360550,like have you seen the 2007 presentation jobs gave
360551,worse people do not buy phones in order to interact with some brockshane such an interaction is simply one of the things it can do
360552,he laid out an extremely compelling case for why you wanted an iphone it was obvious to anyone watching that presentation that the world had changed
360553,either that or you were shouting that it wasnt possible rim
360554,i watched that thing live on a night shift
360555,iphone example is inaccurate i was using browsers on phones for years before an iphone but the iphone made it _easier_ and _more accessible_ this is the key
360556,its like selling a new brand and hyping up connection to the internetour phone seriously connects to the internet faster than any other phone
360557,think of all the normies you can get minting useless nfts directly
360558,something being already possible is not an argument against further development
360559,it was obvious how the iphone browser differed from featurephone browsers
360560,when was the last time you watched that product announcement
360561,it wasnt until it came out
360562,it was obvious from the demo
360563,but here before this thing has anything really announced youre crapping on it lol
360564,you clearly did not watch it when it was presented
360565,i was in cupertino dude
360566,okay so you were in the bathroom for the browser demo
360567,well the fact that its using android already makes the conclusion fairly easy to draw
360568,i am very familiar with this particular topic and thats why its so reminiscent of those days because for months all we heard was this type of stuff from people until they actually got to experience the phone
360569,solana phone isnt for changing the world or we its about giving normies experienced with obsessively documenting their lives anew device in which theyll do it on your chain
360570,if a decent os with native implementation combined with a phone with hopefully good hardware security comes out then my point is obvious adoption and usage increases all things equal
360571,it was in fact quite obvious that if the thing lived up to the demo it was going to change everything the only question was whether it would live up to the demoand yes people said that they didnt need that anyway surebut we dont even have a demo here of compelling features
360572,do you think more people went out to buy samsung phones because of that
360573,you could argue about whether or not you needed pinch to zoom or whatever whether you wanted a hardware keyboard or not but they made actual claims about what the thing could do and why youd want it
360574,this is uhhh maybe itll be better with integration and nfc support
360575,i dont represent solana i have no idea what this thing will do lol
360576,we have very limited information
360577,so how about we put away the breathless praise of their governance model until they announce something substantial that was produced by it
360578,until then were making a phone is just standard traditional organizational bullshit
360579,but im discussing what a crypto native phone could _potentially_ be useful for at least in my view and i think solana is wise for going into this arena although i have doubts theyll be able to deliver
360580,not least because hardware is hard
360581,you havent actually mentioned anything that the phone could potentially be useful for beyond what current phones can do well enough though theres no part of the experience that is made better by oslevel integration
360582,you and i must have different levels of patience with our crypto apps on our phones
360583,i find it an exceptionally irritating experience
360584,yeah but the os isnt the problem the apps are
360585,would be nice if we stopped pretending theyre breaking new ground here and arent doing something no one in recent history has done
360586,if a decent os with native implementation combined with a phone with hopefully good hardware security comes out then my point is obvious adoption and usage increases all things equal
360587,do you think more people went out to buy samsung phones because of that
360588,so were in agreement that this can just be an app then
360589,i know at least some did
360590,please post receipts
360591,i have said from the beginning i am arguing for the os not an app and not hardware per se
360592,right well you havent described anything that needs os support to improve
360593,youre unhappy with current crypto apps cool so they should make a better app
360595,if there is some os level support needed then someone should be able to give an example of it right
360596, i dont think were likely to agree and i think ivangbi is gonna get irritated at circular arguments eventually lol
360597,why dont we have cryptospecific desktop oses i mean shouldnt the same issues apply
360598,please finalize ur arguments it has been 130 messages haha sorry 3
360599,for the same reason we dont have a cryptospecific many things
360600,decent os native implementation good hardware security stuff that actually mattersbrand name market experience captive audience how much more revenue do you think samsung got because of this
360601,why not make a custom rom to work with the hardware available then
360602,and yes if there were better crypto integration at os level itd be neato
360603,i agree with this approach more than making a phone
360604,why though
360605,does anyone know the valuation that stepn raised at
360606,why not
360607,you can use your xpubkey to calculate all your used addresses iirc
360608,why do we need an os when we had dos
360609,features start at 100 points and must justify their existence beyond 100 points
360610,i just dont want to see another software company pretend to do hardware and fail crypto or not crypto is a separate issue
360611,ivan is going to ban me if i say this more than this last time no one has named a single os feature that would improve these apps until you can you obviously do not need a custom os to improve the apps
360612,because if you can support something natively you can build better optimized things without a bunch of hamfisting
360613,im clearly talking to people who know nothing about software and hardware and oses because everyone keeps saying support natively as if it means anything
360614,you know that user code runs on the processor too right it has access to all the same hardware as the os
360615,3 minutes and then lights out
360616,i can tell youre getting frustrated isis but dis is not de wei to make a point you have yours and others have theirs
360617,you also know that oses have module support enabling code to be loaded into the kernel which enables native support without writing an entire new os
360618,so what is native support is it replacing the bios efi is it installing a new tpm chip do we need entirely new processor architectures
360619,and cool thats one approach go 4 it to whoever does im not advocating reinventing the wheel
360620,nobody said an os is being built from scratch it explicitly said its based on android
360621,you kind of are its been 3 minutes cut thread here
360622,i think it involves separating the tpg from the rpi tbh when the sum comes through they wont even be able to calculate native psus
360624,if the selling point of your new phone brand is allows me to connect to the brockshane directly for some as yet vague definition of directly that isnt covered by how phones work today then well i hope you have a lot of money to keep the manufacturers alive
360625,there is the fruit phone iphone samsung bkk and then everybody else
360627,ok and basta take to dms blz
360628,lets all dm ivangbi our arguments per his instruction p
360629,
360630,misleading its just a refundable 100usdc deposit no
360631,yeah
360632,doesnt ship til q1 2023 so this is kind of like people putting deposits on the tesla truck public show of interest
360635,during peak of threema era 2014 there were few whitelabels selling kinda secure phones hope its not one of them repackaged
360636,
360637,
360638,and there is a receiver address which will receive all the funds is the receiver the hacker
360639,
360640,convexfinancecom is the domain
360641,but does everyone know that
360642,seems like you dont
360643,at one point i think they were running google ads with a fake website
360644,wonder how long it takes to generate such a similar address
360645,4 and 4 very little
360646,iirc
360647,like the first and last 4 are essential of course but this isnt just 4 and 4
360648,maybe its just random chance but several other characters scattered throughout also ping me as being similar enough that if i were just skimming the entire address i might still accept it
360649,0xf403a2c10b0b9fef8f0d4f931df5d86ad187ae310xf403c135812408bfbe8713b5a23a04b3d48aae31 nah seems quite random
360650,i dont use convex
360651,it is not random chance
360652,they just made sure itd look the same on metamask
360653,yeah
360654,whats interesting is that earlier today curves had an ipfs issue and was alerted as phishing
360655,using aragonnetwork
360656,not related
360657,conincidece
360658,yes
360659,cool so yall tracked the issue down what it end up flagging as a false positive or we
360662,in progress
360663,will there be a disclosure or post mortem
360664,
360665,yes
360666,has anyone got chance to read trail of bits report
360667,which report
360668,
360670,ohh its on waiting list plan to read it sometime this week
360671,there are some sick findings in the report which should be looked into
360672,any chance of a tldr ser
360673,i cant be bothered to read
360674,research they discovered that significant unintended centralities pervasively affect the security of current blockchains including bitcoin ethereum and even newer especially proofofstake chainsin short they claiming that blockchains arent immutable
360675,its in the twitter thread i believe
360676,yes i suggest reading the tweet
360677,oh shit it really is lol
360678,
360679,hello looking for help i think i was scammed however i was able to return the stellar lumens to my lobstr account although it shows it was received it does not show the balance in my account can someone help
360680,was the harmony bridge exploited
360681,
360682,
360683,oh wow you guys are already on it
360684,theres a few other bridges on and off connext anyswap synapse if you have to move funds fyi
360685,dunno if they have have shut down for harmony as of yet and liq is very thin
360686,
360687,against state actors that would look to shut downneuter an assumed to be distributed network they unironically suggest identifying and chipping every human running a node as a solution funny
360688,humanodes goals and objectives malicious actors may try to steal your biometric data using a futuristic printer to bypass the biometric processing protocol we can mitigate this angle of attack by removing the key from the external world per se and putting it inside a human body there are a lot of ways to do so but the most common are biochemical dna signatures and braincomputer interfaces bcis if the network is built so that node creation is possible only through internal biometric processing where keys do not exist externally then the mechanism becomes tremendously impenetrable at some point humanode will have to transcend to this kind of verification of human existenceabsolutely nothing will go wrong with this not one
360692,harmony suffered explotion before internally
360693,wow
360694,topology launched isaac a fully onchain starknet reality game based on resource collection and event based strategy governance has 0 financial incentives at play and all voting mechanics are hard coded including immutable rules for what constitutes meaningful play and thus voice voting power anyone can exit by forking the entire system the only reliable moat any carsedao has would be the culture relationship and capability of the angel and players to govern and evolve its subject and charter together

360706,nan
360707,wow surveillance state you are all guilty until proven innocent
360709,lucky me
360712,does anybody have materials about protocols that have a high pe ratio preferably those with value accrual for token holders
360713,read this and find info here
360714,incorrect interpretation of numbers and convincing yourself is worse than just outright gambling left side of the curve
360715,i agree but some data is better than none whatsoever i will take caution in interpreting magic numbers thank you sir
360716,wouldnt it affect the whole europe operations as its based out of the netherlands
360717,see them as pxiels that form a broader picture
360718,dont take single pixel and think this is the objective truth
360719,this is whats wrong with most analysis
360720,if synapse was run by another team you mightve seen thanks for the fees tweet
360721,science evolves with each new data point crypto forms cults with fucking bullshit sometimes stock to flow aaaaaah
360722,yeah for sure there will be alternatives just envisioning the awesome future of simple and decentralized payments that work and are accepted anywhere and the journey towards that level of adoption d
360725,
360727,anubis hack wallet is moving
360728,
360729,sisyphusdoteth
360730,
360731,anubis money on the go
360732,yeah
360734,we can go down the rabbithole on this one the acceptance without going through centralized services is still low because a credit card does what a credit card is suppose to do in developed countries and more so theoretically yes every shop person could accept crypto payments but in practice its not the case and for me personally mass acceptance of crypto directly anytime and anywhere would be the ultimate goal
360740,tornado gg
360742,what took them so long
360747,guys can someone know wassies by wassies treasury needed for research
360748,funds are sisyphu
360750,is the anonyminity pool on 100eth on tornado high enough feels like its all hacks going in so anything coming out can almost certainly be ascribed to a hack maybe cant tell which one but a hack none the less i would imagine it would make exchanges reject any deposits
360751,what are the reasons that necessitate the use of tornado
360752,its a mixer hides where the funds came from the beauty of tornado is they give you a receipt so you can prove after the fact where they orginated from
360753,i know what it does but is there any nonmalicious reasons as to why its needed to hide where the funds came from
360754,yeah privacy
360755,any opinions on if stargate can have similar issue with bridge hack based on their relayer being a multisig
360762,if you send a friend 20 do you want them to be able to look around and see whathow much you have
360764,
360766,
360767,is there anybody from harmony here
360769,doesnt really matter
360770,its gone
360772,even so youll never see a dime
360773,nothing happens in crypto
360780,hey guys does anyone use safesnap with gnosis safe do you have any issues with it
360781,i suppose there were some security concerns but cant find anything
360787,ahahaha a very dope thing hello fellow humans
360788,recently there was some security issue i wouldnt do it idk if its worth it
360791,something to watch a major power struggle is brewing in makerdao party lines are being drawn as shown by several controversial polls with record turnout the largest voter is recentlyreturnedfounder runekek currently on the losing end of several polls
360792,anyone from ribbon finance here
360793,
360794,juliankoh
360795,oh boy what happened
360796,just want to check if dns hijacking are related
360797,convexribbon
360798,they were exposed to the dns hijack like convex
360799,there is a third protocol as well
360800,i assume convexribbon are talking to each other already
360801,is it all namecheap
360802,
360803,
360804,it certainly looks that way
360805,any protocol using namecheap probably need to start looking
360806,three compromised accounts with 2fastrong passwords and no given explanation from the registrar
360807,it seems like there could be a compromised employee in namecheap itself in which case they need to be named and shamed and warn people to move away from there
360808,so far none of the three affected accounts have received an explanation about how the breach happened so pretty worrying wont use namecheap again
360809,hi anyone know airdrop tool for tron network
360810,hey any suggestion how i could check token allowances of my gnosis safe address
360811,can you tweet this wanna get retweets going
360812,someone can everything is pointing to a namecheap breach but it could all be coincidental at this stage
360813,is there no explanation from namecheap
360814,none so far
360815,thats so fucked up
360816,hi guysdoes anybody know not expensive but reliable vps with location in dubai
360817,is something wrong with paraswapkeep getting an error
360818,dm with details and ill check
360819,careful of scams
360820,most popular hosts like hetzner provide only data centers in europe some has japan but dubai is not popular
360821,hey
360822,does anyone know if ribbon got hacked
360823,dyor
360824,yep pinged you
360825,its mostly lame
360826,its confirmed same attacker on ribbon and convex
360827,use gandainet or dnsimplecom
360828,this is misleading mining pool operators do not own the underlying mining rigs
360829,they leave that fact out
360830,eg look at sparkpool a double digit pool that closed down back in sept
360831,their hashrate didnt go to one place it was diffused
360834,
360836,they caught the attack immediately so they are okay just follows same patterns as ribbon and convex
360837,so anyone using namecheap registrar should go look at potential dns changes

360849,responsibility
360850,well im not in the bottom of the list when you sort it by eul delegated so thats not too bad
360851,i will delegate some eul to you i just have one question which is better euler or aave
360852,is this a trick question
360858,in ivan we trust

360885,yup
360886,gotta be on that palindrome ip address game
360887,what legal risks does the delegates here
360888,if you are a us person you risk going to hail if you breath fresh air within the state of the great city of new york ok dumb comment ignore that delegate risk some call omg u r in a general partnership then but thats so opaque and retarded all this legal jumbo is unknown and is usually a fugazi
360889,celsius thinking about bankruptcy
360890,speaking of bridge hacks axie ronin bridge to reopen following 550m hackimplementing improvements recommended by certik pledge to recover or reimburse the stolen user funds
360891,damn chances they can actually recover or reimburse
360892,the bridge hasnt been opened this entire time
360893,
360894,hahaha legally i feel delegate is the board if tomorrow deleagtes decide to make the token yield bearing and its considered a security then wouldnt delegates be responsible for thatin a traditional company theres a do liability insurance and the board is paid heavily versus here the protocol is able to put all the risk from team and investors to the delegates for a small cost because delgates are very passionate about the success protocol
360895,its all mumbo jumbo you wont get anything evem closer to truth from lawyers so either accept the risks and do it or accept the risks and dont touch it
360896,thats actually the sad truth every law firm that we spoke to had very very different opinions
360897,i think nobody requested it lol
360898,i just figured it was opened or some of it was reconstituted at this point
360900,is the nft avenue group private anyway i had a question is there any breakdown on whats the gas cost of fully onchain nfts
360901,hello everyone im doing a project for a university on the subject of cex dex can i send a link to a google survey here
360902,thats actually a feature not a bug the primary use case of daos is still evading securities law
360903,not saying daos dont have any other potential uses or wont evolve in the future but thats kind of the selling point right now
360904,i also thought that but why the biggest daos uniswap dydx havent been able to evade securities law even after enough decentralisation and have their tokens kind of worthless primarily because the majority of the hodlers team investors are in us
360905,
360906,question for lobs is rainbow bridge the only way i can bridge usdc from aurora to mainnet i tried to use multichain but no usdc
360907,synapse probably
360908,check debridgescom bridge aggregator
360909,anyone familiar with foundryis there a way to travel to a blocknumber during a testi tried to call the vmroll function to set the blocknumber but its not what i want i want to do something like forkurl and forkblocknumber but inside the test
360910,foundry support tg would get better answers
360911,you can do it on celer
360913,thats not possible at least for now
360914,i use synapse
360915,
360919,lol hacked or bitcoin whats that supposed to mean bribed via bitcoin
360920,nan
360921,
360922,what does this even
360923,someone was either given bitcoin to do this or they were hacked
360924,or just paid in general just weird to mention that specific asset
360925,not sure i am ready to celebrate yet when goldman come in at administration they are going to get this at a super fire sale price they also are not garantueed to buy the user debt side of the business maybe just take the certain assets and chop them in certain scenarios could put further sell side pressureyou would hope they save the users but until they release any details i wouldnt bank on it
360926,bitcoinorg was registered on namecheap as early as august 2008 i wonder if they have any cc details on file about that particular registration

360933,love your name by the way
360934,wow thank you
360935,depends on the compression and assets being stored
360936,tldr is total cost is cost 32 bytes to store in calldata or contract storage multiplied by amt of info you want to record
360937,up to you to find a cost effective encoding schema gzip rlp or otherwise
360938,have some more job boards and tg channels on my compendium that may be helpful
360939,legend has it that the registration was paid for via a cash delivery in envelope with a bogus return address satoshi also delegated responsibility to others in tricky ways for example in an email chain to gavin he once asked if he could put gavins name alongside his in a list of contributors on the website later on satoshi removed his own name and gavins was at the top of the list
360956,mind if i shoot you a dm
360957,thank you farm42 do you mind if i dm
360961,is anyone else starting to get annoyed with the whole this is all 3acs fault narrative the whole point of a hedge fund is to get leverage and take massive risks yes sometimes the trade moves against you and blows up if anyone is to blame for the contagion its the lenders and their shitty decision making their job was to make low risk loans that can be liquidated with minimal loss and they clearly failed assuming theres no fraud dont think ive seen evidence of any its not the lenders getting tricked by 3ac they failed at their job and didnt do enough diligence they got greedy and screwed up
360962,no evidence of fraud
360963,i think 3ac has at the very least mislead some of their lenders i agree in principle that likely the lenders are at fault as well looks like greed got the better of both sides in this situation 3ac seems to deserve more blame for now
360964,is there any evidence of actual fraud faked documents etc if so obviously my point above doesnt stand but a lenders job is to not be mislead and double check claims made
360965,they got loans under false pretences and moved clients funds without permission according to reports
360966,what false pretenses fake documents or the lenders just failed to check their claims
360967,me saying trust me im rich and the bank not double checking or requiring documentation isnt the same thing as fraud
360968,still fraud though
360969,you wont get conclusive evidence for a while but it increasingly looks like they acted in a way that could be considered fraud legally problem is that we basically just have hearsay from involved parties before this gets put into legal documents
360970,lenders in the space probably have learned a lesson id not worry too much about that
360971,yeah thats my feeling about the situation as well theres no real evidence how could there be just discovery will take years of any fraud feels more likely that the lenders just didnt do their job
360972,making exaggerated claims isnt fraud although obviously unethical faking documents to prove your exaggerated claims is
360973,couch legal dont
360975,fair enough but then we should probably also stop blaming 3ac for the whole mess without having any actual evidence anyways i have no horse in the race i just woke up to a twitter feed of a bunch of dumb finger pointing and got annoyed
360976,i mean theyre still to blame the risk they took is not justifiable given their size and the fact that they were trading with borrowed money they should have known better for sure
360977,ah yeah thats where we disagree they can take what ever risks they want assuming they were a hedge fund and clearly disclosed to their investors that they were going to do so if anything they should be taking big risks
360980,yup hedge funds blow up all the time then the people raise new money and open the next one if anything its remarkable they took so long to blow up
360982,it all depends on how they acted towards their lenders especially in writing the rest is debatable but subjective so we wont reach a conclusion here
360983,provide evidence or dont make claims
360986,they have done stuff i do not like before so they now they must be involved also is not evidence but conjecture making claims
360989,i want the one specific to what you claimed above i am aware of the history of alameda
360990,does anybody have clarity about the serum supply unlocks coingecko says total supply 1bn but max supply 10bn any idea which one is correct
360991,in any case its a shitcoin but i am trying to assess how bad it is
360994,yeah totally agreed im assuming standard margin lending agreements and no fraud but i think they deserve the benefit of the doubt and assuming those things they just did their job poorly but still
360996,yeah but 1bn fdv or 10bn fdv quite different
360997,just do not buy into that shit unless you see a very clear and defined trade those tokens are designed to serve as maximum retail exit liquidity
360998,its not a scam its just dishonest shitty behavior that founders now know and should better not touch it many have known it already before thats fine to show facts so people can decide what to do but if they wanna ape a 400b fdv project let em fin
360999,the other stuff is couch legal a bit lets wait for final details meanwhile just dont get rekt cheers
361001,lol lets be clear reasonable options can be only shorting or doing nothing
361002,that is not fraudulent just mercenary and dishonest thats allowed
361004,id prefer nothing because even if you short you can get caught in one of sams donation wicks to the upside theres better options in the market than interacting with 234234bn fdv tokens
361034,this is literal spam redacted
361039,the floor price for nft is it always the lowest ask price or the lowest price it was traded at in a specific period
361040,lowest ask price
361041,hey guys heres a goldmine of beginner web3 resources
361042,kinda simping hard there buddy
361043,
361046,if even a fraction of this turns out to be somewhat accurate fraud is absolutely the term 3ac should be categorized under
361047,there is also sovs
361051,svanevik you can still arbitrage this via the amm though if you dont mind holding eth until bonders replenish liquidity or in worst case a 7 day withdrawal window
361052,so youre fine if you just want to get 1 on your eth in a couple hoursdays
361053,so the rate is guaranteed
361054,yea its just a normal stable amm forked from saddle afaik you can find it in the convert tab swap to heth the heth can be redeemed 11 for eth on main net as soon as bonders have eth on main net again alternatively i guess you should be able to redeem via the 7 day exit window though but thats probably only possible via the contracts and im not 100 sure but im pretty sure since otherwise hop wouldnt be trustless if you depend on bonder liquidity to redeem your heth
361056,
361057,why would anyone support ideas which lead to makerdaos demise
361058,on the corporatization of cryptocurrency a study
361059,there is a vote going to establish a love core unit hugely reminiscent how usg names the most horrendous things with pleasant sounding words
361060,so which one are you in favour of
361061,im in favor of max decentralization
361062,i voted against maker playing with rwa but this is much worse
361063,whats the maker love unit meant to do
361064,you can read here
361065,but there are more sus polls like
361066,okay so its some kind of lending oversight unit not clear from a quick read what it will actually do
361067,thats probably the point as if mkr governance wasnt obfuscated enough
361068,lol a good example of someone thinking littering decentralized every other paragraph makes it so
361069,love and makershire hathaway damn its like a competition about who can come up with the most cringe names
361070,and also check out the proposal to appoint a delegate a chief legal officer
361071,im not with you on that tbh
361072,
361073,i havent looked deeply just my impression from how these things are structured
361074,maker is not purist onchain only thing its one of the few daos that has a decent chance to actually make a useful service for meatspace as well
361075,its much easier to make just a crypto native lending protocol but id wager its a dead end
361076,selfcontained crypto economy is not the endgame
361077,i dont have mkr or delegation to vote and if i did i might vote against the proposal is so vague i cant understand whats it is supposed to do but going for rwas in general is the right thing imo
361078,road to hell is paved with good intentions
361079,and people optimising for white collar job security
361080,i know there are ppl from maker cus that read this group time to stop just lurking
361081,theres no right thing many of the ppl pushing for rwa around maker has a lets just simp for and follow the banks lead which tbh is gross
361082,i really dunno how its going to work the daorwa is uncharted territorybut if it works it will actually look a lot like a conservative in strategy transparent bank bc banks actually work
361083,at what cost sir at what cost
361084,whats the cost
361085,everything
361086,
361088,yuga labs is sewing anyone who traded rrbaycpage 4 in full pdf
361089,hilarious
361090,what do you think is the end game
361091,wow hey guys rohit here im new to this space im leading partnerships for an onchain treasury management provider and worked in the interoperability space with socket a crosschain bridge aggregator before so excited to stomp the group with an amazing crowd
361092,also yugas really serious im sure this will be a landmark moment for nfts from a legal perspective if they win and can prove ip which is obvious but unsure if the law of the land treats nfts in the definition of what an ip is
361093,wait till they start burning apes in wallets which also bought rrapes
361094,can they do that
361095,thats so not cool
361096,or was it sarcasmlol i dont usually get sarcasm
361097,no i kid they cannot
361098,they can do that for lands right where animoca retains the right to decide who can or cannot use the lands
361099,they can stop you from getting in their parties
361100,yes lands they can nuke
361101,its like a reverse kyc
361102,everything economy on decentralized rails
361103,that was not a good idea they lost so much brand recognition with that move
361104,also arent they still distributing ape tokens can they change ppls alloc
361105,how does that happen if everything is centralized in the exact same fashion as the current system
361108,deserved be ready for lawsuit when you are doing pnd on someones ip
361109,screwing holders and traders is bad founders should suffer
361110,is it a switch everything is exactly the samelets ignore millenia of experience and only do new things
361111,isnt it the people ignoring history that think if they appeal to but blockchain it makes it different
361112,i dont quite get whats your point
361113,my points are decentralized protocols working with rwas will have a lot in common with tradfi working with rwas by necessityand that defi ecosystem that ignores rwas in principle is a sandbox that will not bring any serious change to the world at large
361114,so time to buy rrapes and send them to all the public figures we dont like so much
361115,my points are decentralized protocols working with rwas will have a lot in common with tradfi working with rwas by necessitythere is no such thing as a decentralized protocol working with rwas in practice thats a fundamental contradiction in this context just because makerdao is onchain doesnt make it a decentralized protocol anymore than usdc is decentralized because its a smart contract wrapping a very real world asset
361116,thats for a very narrow definition of decentralization
361117,wont rwas be more suitable for cefi lending platforms than decentralised protocols
361118,i mean have you seen them
361119,and that thinking is exactly what im referring to adding blockchain to the mux doesnt make it decentralized anymore than google is decentralized because the underlying internet is
361120,any experiences with using coinbase card is it worth it
361121,decentralized financial systems existed before blockchain you know
361122,its not an impossible goal
361123,babe cancel the movie tonight why we never leave the house sorry babe its just that ppl on lobsterdao are arguing about the meaning of decentralization again
361124,i didnt say it is it already exists after all im asking what you think is the point of what makerdao is doing
361125,what do you think about goldfinch guys pretty much bridging the deficefi divide offering undercollateralized credit to real businesses in crypto in a bunch of ems just checkout their duneits a rocketship imo
361126,making a successful decentralized lending protocol i think im not super deep in maker
361127,oh wait rwas for maker dao are real world assets not risk weighted assets i was confused how would you create risk weightage without leading to regulations
361128,yeah i use it and like it more than monacowirex combine it with a curve card if you need mastercard
361129,all righti wonder if this card is better when youre abroad
361130,i mean better than a regular bank card
361131,i dont think so limits are bit low and afaik not the most optimal fee structure ofc the convenience of having it linked to your coinbase account that you can deposit quickly to from your wallet is nice
361133,hey does someone have any good resources detailing the whole terraluna crash like an article or paper
361134,sthg like this
361135,amazing
361136,tyty
361137,please check ctrlf and also pinned message random shills i see u r not shilling ser ur messages read well are not adding much hey check out this is so good makes about 0 sense after a certain project was discussed 100 times
361138,hey ivangbi i wasnt shilling i dont even own any goldfinch i was trying to add to the discussion around the maxi thesis of blockchains going mainstream and thought it was a case in point connecting defi with a rwas sorry if it wasnt in line with the rules
361139,yikes you took him too seriously it seems
361140,i sometimes ban myself a habit
361141,
361142,clout chasers chasing clout
361143,thread not done yet
361144,they dunno how twitter works so give it a few minutes to complete i guess
361145,was thinking that only lol
361146,
361147,lol namecheap
361148,how many times they hacked their dnss this year
361150,how is price related to platform security
361151,nonsense
361152,if all is well secured all is well secured
361153,there are not tiers on that
361154,pay us more or our agents might change your dns records
361155,thats it
361156,thats some cash grab opp lol
361157,many projects go to namecheap cause they let almost anonymous registration and pay with crypto
361158,pay to not rug thats how well get through bera
361159,basically maybe he will manage those domains himself or something
361160,protection money
361161,most domain services have like 0 security if you can convince their support team you are the owner or own any workfromhome laptop you literally can hack all their clients
361162,plus normally those agents are not well paid
361163,spiritswap was hacked that way not much time ago
361164,if you really want to know then no i dont see goldfinch or any similar construct as any sort of decentralizedits business a startup using smart contracts for their business just because something is using smart contracts somewhere doesnt make it decentralized onchain decentralized
361165,bitstamp deposit addresses are or were contracts bitstamp is 100 a centralized exchange
361166,is such a product useful depends id still be using cexs if i wasnt worried about waking up to a disingenuous notification to send a dna sample because of suspicious activity but i dont pretend cexs are somehow some sort of decentralized thingamajig
361167,i totally buy into that argument onchain is def not in any way a proxy for decentralization so whats the end game like for a pure play decentralized play in your opinion
361168,so whats the end game like for a pure play decentralized play in your opinionis this asking what i think a pure decentralized app would look like or what the end goal is
361169,good question now that you mention both actually
361170,liquity and uni v2v3 pretend the governance does not exist it doesnt in practice alternative to current system keyword being alternative i dont believe everyone has a use for crypto needs to be onboarded or be able to be onboarded to crypto or that if we end up with fewer actual users than the population of the us crypto is failing or something
361171,woah thats quite a crack at the current prevailing bull case from maxis lol
361172,i personally feel theres a strong real world use case of the blockchain more than crypto currencies irl for starters i think accounting frauds can be nailed or perhaps tracked much faster if corporate ledgers are on the blockchain educational certs health records etc all seem to have a better use case on the chain than irl seems to be quite a case for a bull
361173,but im not discounting the case for a real world decentralized currency just look at the mammoth inflation windfall if you leave things to regulators it hasnt generally bode well i totally feel the need for a decentralized global reserve currency dunno if btc is the answer to that at least not immediately but the need is well founded imo
361174,for all but the first all id say is but whyfor the first im guessing youre referring to public blockchains well imagine if paying with cash meant giving the recipient and friends a meticulous and detailed record of every person thats held that note as well as just about every transaction youve made from the wallet the note came out from and coincidentally potentially your net worth that transparency doesnt sound like something corporate is going to be particularly interested in imo
361175,does your stance change if the company is publicly listed and shareholders arent just institutional buyers but retailers too
361176,is there any easy api that lets you query the twitter social graph who follows who
361177,or like a tool that lets you view and cluster the social graph
361178,the corporate part no not sure why it would
361179,educational frauds are big too people impersonating degrees and showing off in the public domain is not so uncommon how many quacks are there practicing as a doc and treating actual patients maybe not so much in the us or other mature markets but a hard reality in many parts of the world outside it just makes a lot of sense in bringing a certain transparency to that system
361180,well thats because my capital is invested and if some corporate cracker is siphoning away my funds id for sure as heck want to know also arent listed corporate net worths already a public number
361181,does anyone know any good research articles on the possible cases of uncollateralized loans in defi
361184,dont know of any but id suggest to look into the state of art of onchain repitation systems sbts etc uncollateralized loans in truly permissionless system is only possible through reputation track records imho
361185,applies to non 100 collateralized
361187,dont need a realtime public database that inadvertently leaks every users transactional history for such a thingas for credentials those are inherently the purview of whoever is giving the credentials who for one reason or the other may need to be able to revoke them all blockchain would do here is act as a data store
361188,oh yeah i heard something about them will read it thx
361189,thats not a defi thing though undercoll loans arguably not even really possible in defi in the tradfi sense of that word have the normal use cases of undercollateralized loans
361190,as ivan said it would pretty much be for the same reason as it would be in tradfi i need moniez for thing only replace money with whatever crypto asset and thing with probably nfts
361192,yes of course but what about the liability how do you ensure that the loan will be repaid assuming that the system in question is at worst pseudonymous
361193,thats not use cases then but implementation you are on the right track there is more research on it around but this one covers some of the present ideas
361194,wrong wording indeed thanks for sharing

361214,i see people on tl being leas critical of worldcoin founders r good people we dont hate them anymore strange sudden change of heart
361215,ppl change of heart wonder whyhow but i always felt the same as the mit article said on it
361216,we found that the companys representatives used deceptive marketing practices collected more personal data than it acknowledged and failed to obtain meaningful informed consent
361217,absolutely shocked nobody couldve seen that coming
361218,the pay for those operators were incentivised based on how many people signed up that was bound to happen
361219,ah more drama
361220,does it need to be a token has become do you need to be a middlemancustodian
361221,progress
361222,and what category of personal data
361223,are you familiar with the topics stepan gershuni is working on
361224,they harvest doppler radar detection of your heartbeat breathing and other vital signs photographsscans of your eye and body and metadata like location and presumably heritage
361225,not very defi
361226,
361227,oh starting with photos everything next even if the user has agreed there are many rules and regulations and how this data needscan be stored regulations on how access processing and so on takes placeand medical or near medical information as well as some other things fall under the highest requirements for protection hmm
361228,beyond the legal specifics why would a 2nd3rd party ever need that information
361229,you dont understand what were doing but give us your data anyway is disgusting
361230,they should try convincing their wealthy neighbours about the virtues of web3 first
361231,well there are also good fittingsmy friends have an application about maps and wifi they collect data on the network signal level and many morethen they impersonally sell the cast of these statistics to the telecom company which aggregates such information for telecom operators of other participants in this marketfrom what is recorded about people and reworked turns out to be very cool debugging information
361232,just gave an example that it could be useful
361233,harvesting anonymous and publicly available data is relatively cool your friends arent touring impoverished communities with an orb that collects biometric data while promising financial freedom
361234,just wow
361235,hahaahah
361236,i mean that description paints a caricature of evil personified
361237,but mate child charity like wtf i know in the balkans politicians have enormous appetite but cmoon
361238,yeah the thread is so heavy i would want to crosscheck some of the claims its out of this world
361239,i posted about this they had these flashy promises of privacy and then a note that none of them apply during beta
361240,just checking will write if i get smth
361241,perpetual mainnet beta incoming
361242,thats right they just make it possible to get in touch anywhere in the world
361243,but yes i understand that its not the same thing and i think a lot about providing isolation only minimal sufficient and if you can use information without eye reading then you need to do it within business processes and so inside every section of the supply chain in generaland the data is not encrypted where they shouldnt be they just dont exist once upon a time since 2016 hah it took me more than 9 months to detail and debug these and other concepts dp its important but now the world is what it is despondency is not a good comrade to someone who sets himself the goal of to change something and do better thats why i apparently reacted reflexively i tried to outline legality and outline the possibility that such data is collected for good deedswe just have to provide solutions that will make abuse of trust unprofitable
361244,i am not ser but will def check out
361245,weve known each other for about 5 years and all this time he explores issues of decentralized reputation certificates diplomas and so onthis is an incredibly important and fascinating topic for him i think he can be called a very professional and absorbed evangelist in matters of decentralized reputation
361246,now he started trying to make material in fideo format but if im not mistaken in the first records the speech was in russian if the following episodes he didnt change the language
361247,he constructs the reasonable suspicion that all the money for sick kids was drained without providing any evidence which is the whole base for all his other claims
361248,lol master otter shits all over arrington here as well lobsters nexos next your bets
361249,rules and regulations have done zilch to stop companies and dubious startups from abusing peoples personal data if they can afford the fine
361250,bro you havent lived on ballkans its mild by local standards
361251,i may be wrong but the fine would be for each precedenthah im not sure it makes sense in this situation but later i can talk to a lawyer
361252,ser u are right about the mild part
361253,of course it is and it does nothing
361254,i think something else can happen to binance perhaps in the part that is related to the neobank future retail ewallets currency for settlements binance pay and so on

361262,any vc startup promising poor people the sun moon and stars while collecting personal information but we will absolutely not use it for what you think we will is lying to you always
361266,the world is not what it is and history is full of people doing wrong while changing something and doing better legality and business processes are fluid in the very long term what worldcoin is doing right now is objectively unethical and fundamentally misguided education is the only real solution but its unprofitable and very difficult lets abuse trust to promote trustless technology instead

361270,
361271,hello sirs a silly question is binance consider under eu regulations do they need to comply to this if this was about to be approve and what is an alternative exchange
361272,binance has changed rules here and there depending on diff countrys regulations within the eu like blocking derivatives in some places right so they would have to adapt possibly or be forced out fined
361273,they just very recently setup offices in paris
361274,go defi already but if you really need an exchange for something kucoin doesnt ask for kyc
361275,they do they at least did when i signed up
361276,there is a limit on withdrawal without kyc but you can use it
361277,i still will not give my biometric data to a private company especially if its named worldcoin as a matter of fact id trust safemoon more than worldcoin lol
361278,kraken is probably the best for eu

361282,can you confirm yourself through any openbank mechanisms there
361283,nah better believe than hes evil and alameda the most fraudulent organization ever because some influencers dont know how to trade and assume they are behind every wick on this market lol

361303,dunno how true this is but oh well
361304,kraken works until it doesnt have usdc deposit on hold for more than 3 weeks with no explanation from them probably some aml issues but it would be nice to get something faster than 3 weeks very sad
361305,usdc is trickyi never use it for personal cases
361306,all cexes are checking usdc too carefully
361307,better switch to dai if possible
361308,more careful than usdt
361309,same careful lol
361310,i try to avoid both of them as much as possible
361311,are there any exchanges which let you withdraw dai for fiat 11 to usd
361312,good questionhavent tried it yetkraken looks like an option for such exchange as well
361313,probably liquidity will be rather lowcant cash out directly dai usdeur if its a sizable portionwould need to wait a bit
361314,dai usd and dai eur can work in kraken if you are patient but yeah i would not make a big market order there
361315,never had issues w kraken on anything unless big order means 8 figs its all fine
361316,can also use their otc for this ive been told
361317,well some people do trade 8 figs
361318,but yeah for europegermany i am very happy with kraken for fiat onofframp but i dont deal with too high volume
361319,eunl works fine
361320,otc in kraken is top recommendedhonestly otc on bitfinex is also top level and technologically but fiat inout is a special game i would normally recommend kraken for most of the cases
361321,does anyone know whats the breakdown of 1inch circulating supply at the moment how much is distributed through community incentives grants and claimed through investorscontributors allocations
361322,does this help
361323,hey thanks but it doesnt unfortunately i mean its showing how it should look like approximately but its not real time and apparently not all the investors contracts are the same so i thought maybe there is a way to track based on distributing contracts addresses
361324,why this usdc fud
361325,not a fud more for people to be aware that its still centralized and some tracking is there
361326,oh okey
361327,anyone interested in fun sunday read
361328,heh thats one out of person of interest
361329,the thing isuk and us are doing same or similar those who worked in palantir can tell you some scary stories
361330,were not big brother they are we have news they have propoganda
361331,
361332,this was 5 years ago i imagine their capabilities 10xed since then and this is not whataboutism just saying its not paranoia if they really are after all of us
361333,hello all we are working on a small crypto project and wrapping things before launch do anyone have a self diy security audit we can run ourselves any projects that wont charge leg and an arm thanks
361334,thats not how security audits work
361335,moreso if you already dont know whats supposed to be there worst idea is to do any diy
361336,got it thanks any idea where we can start
361337,maybe this helps
361338,thanks
361339,
361340,
361341,if i told you
361342,is that actually him i thought he had a blue checkmark
361343,definitely him
361344,you did but what could possibly be worse than what we already know
361345,it cant be saved
361346,satoshis private keys have been found in plain text on a server running since 2008 in the basement of some university and the north koreans have found it
361347,youll find out in the next few days
361348,wouldnt you agree that the market has already measured that outcome as a nonzero chance
361349,nope
361350,crypto space was euphoric when they heard goldman sachs was tryna bail em out
361351,that ended up being a lie
361352,
361353,this weeks announcements should settle everything
361354,thanks ser
361355,well its not a bailout the goldman stuff people should read better
361356,what is celsiuss current wbtc liq price
361357,i guess we all knew this day was coming f
361358,people are desperate for hopium its like when someone reported binance bought 100k btc people deposited 100k btc in binance
361359,goldman is bailing out celsius you guys the market is saved
361360,the saudis are bidding lfgggg
361361,wall street bonuses soon
361362,chinese new year
361363,whaaa
361364,tis a joke fren i hope
361365,any thoughts from the weekend enjoyoors
361366,id like to look at projects that can actually be used in real life
361367,according to what ive heard woodcoin has something to do with the ecology
361368,who is that should we know him is it andres alt account
361369,i dont know if im misremembering but i thought 0xb had a blue check mark all i remember is that he was big during defi summer had something going on with cel and was a big supporter of linkswap then he sold his account or something i dunno he got big into apes iirc and thats all that i know
361376,has anyone found a reliable rollover ira us that can at least do btc maybe gbtc if im desperate looks like fidelity is adding the option to 401ks at some point i found some niche places but not sure if id trust them
361377,gbtc scem
361378,yeah no redemption plan worries me they hold random amounts and its worth random amounts as far as i can tell
361379,us equities prolly better investment than crypto anyways
361380,guys is there any good data source to get data on implied volatility vs strike prices for btc and eth i want to calculate the skewness as well as kurtosis for crypto options would really appreciate the help thanks
361381,vaults are perceived to be better and more secure than wallets and it is the reason many defi protocols choose to deposit their funds in a vaultread this on alchemy blog can someone explain technical terms why
361382,guess its about eip 4626
361383,yes its about 4626
361384,i received a dm claiming ill be served a cease and desist for a retweet a rt for gods sake
361385,nan
361386,heres the rt for transparency purposes
361387,are they really trying to intimidate a small account with 800 followers
361388,oh yeah heres the link
361389,wait they made a blog post to send to for cease and decist notice
361390,i am dying here
361391,yes and honestly if theyre suing the 1400 people who retweeted i dont mind splitting with them the costs and expenses including attorneys fees im supposedly liable for
361392,am i also ordered to cease and desist since i read the blog post
361393,i guess youre also splitting their attorney fees with us
361394,one of us
361395,this is so 2022 lmfao solid gold
361396,perhaps they wanted to write a blog post about ceasing and desisting
361397,theyre going full streisand effect
361398,does anyone have any feedback on skale network seems like everyones talking about subnets supernets parachains cosmos chains but noones talking about skale yet they seem like the most compelling ethereum based solution for blockchain as a service tm pending
361399,anyone here got stables on harmony or affected by the harmony bridge hack
361400,u guys ever think harmony will recover whats the worst case scenario here i have some decent usdc there but they are worthless rn
361401,worst case scenario is always it goes to 0 ser
361402,but i doubt they get a bail out or something theyre sort of screwed right now
361403,likely
361404,i think it could end up being a ghost chain unless they somehow manage to salvage this
361405,a 100m bailout for harmony doesnt seem to be too far fetched
361406,thats actually what i need to know can they
361407,neither does a 5 out of 7 signature required for more than 100k in value
361408,
361409,the worst is that someone warned them a few months ago
361410,the likeliest entity to bail them out would be binance but cz said something recently about not encouraging bad behavior with bailouts and letting protocols fail not sure if that was just larping though and him trying to appear fair
361411,if proper audits have been followed the security advisers would have pressed them to act on such blatant and amateur move
361412,did binance labs invest heavily in harmony
361413,i hope sam did for the sake of ferdybitcoin
361414,yeah i was hoping cz step in to bail them out until i saw the referenced tweet at this point i wish i would get accept my usdc loss or sit that one out blindly
361415,not sure if alameda has any connection with harmony or interest in it even
361416,i was checking their crunchbase profile and it does seem youre right
361417,harmony was never working properly anyway
361418,twas easier to step in for celsius3ac because of what they share in common degen vcs
361419,they were recently working on fixing the rpc as well as improving sub eco marketingfunding no
361420,didnt they have 300m to fund their ecosystem
361421,or was it in their own token
361422,yeah good time to do that in full bull market
361423,like you havent a fuckton of time before in 20182020
361424,not sure how much of that they have left but i learned they selfishly misappropriated that man i expected their downfall but didnt know itd affect my stables this bad
361425,thats the problem with bridged stables dai also has this issue with most chain its all wrapped tokens
361426,im literally working in a protocol which tackles this issue x_x
361428,su ikr you guys launched yet been a long time i checked since last year
361429,as someone who has been on harmony for 5ever your hail mary is binance bailing them out binance owns alot of one and is like 40 of the validators a snowball has more of a chance in hell than that money ever coming back
361430,those staked one are getting unlocked soon its going to be bloody for that token i reckon
361431,yes probably i had thought about looking into potential opportunities with stone by looking at validators unstaking but im not doing that work
361432,were close to closed testnet and we aim to launch it publicly by the end of the year its been a long ride but were close to the end and to the beginning after the end
361433,i was literally asked the question about crosschain a few days before the harmony hack x_x
361434,i hope no protocol on harmony hardcoded usdcs value to 1 i never thought this was done until terra collapsed
361435,harmony has fumbled the ball on so many accounts their messages on the hack is tone deaf it would not surprise me to see the funds never recovered i am suspicious of saying that someone broke into their server and stole the keys i feel more like an insider did it who probably put everything into harmony near the top i have 0 proof mind you but harmony is such a disaster it would not surprise me someone looking to copycat the north koreans with the ronin bridge back
361436,i was not personally impacted since i am paranoid but i do feel bad for those impacted
361437,aave did they got exploited i dont know the exact details perhaps someone else could fill intranq paused borrowing
361438,omg why are protocols hardcoding wrapped stablecoins for gods sake w_w
361439,their funding was a mess and everyone was unhappy about it
361440,i dunno for sure if they hard coded but you could buy up cheap usdc borrow one and loop until drained
361441,also liq got very thin very fast on harmony even before the exploit
361442,harmony vision 2026 about to become vision 2022 real quick
361443,obviously banter as i liked them back in the dfk craze
361444,sad to see less competition
361445,they offered 1m bounty to the hacker
361446,thats what optimism offered for an amount 5 times smaller
361448,imagine they offered a 1milly bounty for a 100million refund with wavering zerocriminal charge protection not saying its bad tho but its not encouraging the hacker could easily turn a madlad and send the 100m to a burn address
361449,ridic you gotta give him an offer he cant refuse 1m aint going to cut it
361450,didnt the wormhole hacker refuse 10m
361451,well id say if we use optimisms offer as a reference they should at least offer 5m
361452,why do you think optimism should be a baseline
361453,people have returnedlet money go for less or nothing
361454,is the underlying assumption here that money at risk is a fraction of the money on hand for projects in this space
361455,its obviously a shortcut i took as it shouldnt be evaluated the way i did but theres some substance to it if this is a whitehat hack money will be returned at minimal cost virtually nothing otherwise the objective is to give an incentive big enough to be accepted whats big enough i do think that 1 isnt and that 5 starts to seem more enticing regardless of nominal value
361456,i didnt understand your second question though if you can reformulate please
361457,i do think that 1 isnt and that 5 starts to seem more enticing regardless of nominal valueokay 5 starts to seem more enticing 10 would then be definitely enticing so hypothetically there exists a bug in lido see linus law that will be exploited tomorrow to drain it for all its worth at the moment thats 532bregardless of nominal value were enticing this supposedly fencesitting exploiter with 10 of the money 10 of 532b is 532mare you saying when this happens tomorrow lido should tell the exploiter to keep 532min addition wrt the second question given lidos marketcap is as of the moment of writing 278m where and how does this obvious deficit get plugged
361458,i guess by now most of bancor users will start getting their withdraws and understand the impact of the il loss just happend to me guess that will mark the shit of a protocol it is hope they burn in hell and defi never trust them ever again
361459,what an irony crypto peeople trusted them after biggest ico of 150mln and founders dumping their tokens right after it hit exchanges one of the shadiest team back then warned people many times in telegram groups nobody listened muh bull run
361460,nan
361461,what is the difference between what bancor did and completely rugging a protocol honest q because as a user and im not retail cant see any code is law
361462,tbh never saw too much of shit thrown at them i did saw its a useless protocolos critics its completely different to change the rules overnight
361463,though shit tho im gonna be sure that no one in latam we are poor anyway lol never use them again
361464,yeah because some of the people from here shilled it heavily latam latam
361465,meant to reply to other message but whatever
361466,eh people have been attacking bancor for as long as i can remember in 2017 even more fervently than chainlink isused to bea nontrivial portion of uniswaps early narrative was how it wasnt vaporware with a dirty token like bancor
361467,hi lobsterswe are seeking a good crowdfunding platform for a real estate project in malaysia in return we are planning fractionalized ownerships of the property as per the individuals fundingsdo tell your suggestions
361468,if you received a similar message please share the number of the angel that sent you the message theres a free mint of nfts representing the angel number and the cease and desist its a free mintpreferably create a new walletim usually not super vocal but now they got themselves a vocal dissident in me
361469,even their market strategy has some red flags like when they launched last year they claimed to have signed up over 18k people in chile but no one has tweetedinstagrammedtiktok dance about strange people with a shiny orb scanning poor people do they think we outside useu are primitive people who live naked in forests
361470,i dont live in chile but in south america we have phones with 4g here lol
361471,is there any alternative to ampnet crowdfinding platform
361472,anyone hearing or know anything
361473,yes
361474,lambo the og source
361475,cel 30 last 9 hours
361476,not og source
361477,but heard around the grapevine
361478,pypi python packets steal aws keys from usersarticle comments
361479,heard a few hours ago from a reliable source
361480,
361481,any good tools for trackingmanaging twitter
361482,theres an entire industry around managing ones twitter twitter itself has one called tweetdeck for everybody tweetdecktwittercom other paid tools exist too like buffer
361483,i imagine which one is the best one is there a good list of quality tools
361484,is the best ive found and used a lot of them over the years
361485,especially if youre a threadooorrr
361486,im sure theres a list somewhere on google as for whats better it depends on so many factors do you use threads a lot like gb0514 evidently does do you use desktop to post or mobile do you do analysis on your or other followers do you want to automate spamblockfollowunfollowetc
361489,tweetdeck seems useless typefully is nice but i just want the analytics mostly intrested in deep analytics peak hours research clustering and graphing tools and leaderboard for a specific topic
361490,i have a list of different tools and twitter lists on my compendium that may have some of what you are looking for
361491,sov i dont know you but i love you 3 i needed a few things that i found in your notion
361492,you can also use apify instead of twint if you want an easy web based scrapping tool
361493,peak hours for your users aggregate your own tweets by posting hours and rank by engagement rate
361494,i think scraping yourself does a better job as youre not limited by what you can do
361495,this does not answer your question but both bancor and rugpulls dont violate anything regarding code is law the code is clear in what people can and cannot do so you can see upfront who you need to trust
361496,why would you withdraw now your impermanent loss becomes really permanent
361497,thats because the hacker stole your stables ser you do realize that thats the reason why your wrapped usdc is worth zero now someone stole the actual usdc that those wrapped usdc refer to
361498,lots of protocols still hardcode stables to 1
361499,ok maybe not lots but i know at least one that does this
361500,they didnt hard code this defi protocols use chainlink oracles and chainlink oracles take their prices from cexes if wrapped assets are rugged the entire chain is compromised thats not the defi protocols fault and also not their responsibility
361501,hi all sorry im asking stupid questions because i couldnt figure it out crv token is on different chains it has the mechanics of paying fees to token holders do i understand correctly that each chain has its own accrual and also i could not understand in which token the payment is being made
361502,
361503,watcher guru is retarded be careful
361504,but i assume people already know
361505,hacktivist group lmao
361506,fees accrued on its own chain then bridged back to eth burned to 3crv and distributed to vecrv as 3crv
361509,thank you for clarifying really appreciate it
361510,shitnouns hack got my lobsternft
361511,wait what
361512,their twitter got hack now

361530,you otter
361531,no they sent cease and desist to people who retweeted as well
361532,see here

361558,nan
361560,i remember seeing a discussion about it here
361561,
361563,its not specific to them at all redacted the ping by accident soz
361564,thank you for clarifying last time i read it i thought it was specific to them its still too complex and to be totally honest its a reason i dont want to get too much implicated
361565,guilty or innocent was it necessary for otter to be so casually racist or xenophobic whatever not to mention extreme sensationalism did arrington benefit from sick kid moneycommenting on the subject matter an interesting thing about nexo is that to get 8 apy vs 4 normallyyou have to lock your deposit into 3 monthslong term wondering if that will end up being a blessing or a curse
361566,disperse
361567,not support tron network
361568,less than 1 of all holders have 90 of the voting power in daos reporta user must hold between 01 and 1 of the outstanding token supply to create a proposal and hold between 1 and 4 to pass it
361569,whats up guys fe dev here looking for work irl work is fullstack dev for a bigger car company but im relatively 1 year new to defi i done work for beefy and velas i love ui work so if you have any that needs to be done please reach out
361570,need more caffeine to debunk this bullshit
361571,basically no this data is dirtied because that 1 is typically involving vesting contracts and exchange wallets the datai s dirty and typically not standardised so unles the dao names are shared and the wallet addresses are cleaned this is nonsense but i would like to verify this myself so will post back after digging up the numbers myself
361572,this is very 2018esque fud classic good old times
361573,when you do please say aaaa im debooonkinggg first
361574,now obv dao governance has its own issues and most of it is theatrics but this argument in particular has dirty data and it triggers me little
361575,its called fud look it up
361576,aaaaa im debooooonkingggg
361577,whats this sorry i have been offline for 2 days and have no clue
361578,oh debunking
361579,lmfao
361580,ggg
361581,they include the long tail of dust wallets in data
361582,wouldnt chainalysis know about those
361583,yea they are smart folks but in the absence of opendata set u can question everything
361584,not claiming they did deal with those the article has that frustratingly frequent property of never linking to sources but given their business model is about hunting down people and of course matches what ive seen in practice im inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt
361585,chainalysis have a product to sell lads
361586,lets assume innocent was it necessary for nexo to target small users who simply retweeted the thread with a cease and desist and threatening them with lawsuits
361587,they also work for law enforcement sers
361588,ofc thats why i said let me write after i dig up numbers
361589,are you sure it is nexo who targets them the snapshot you sent last night didnt look like an official account
361590,sauce
361591,yes im sure theyre all followed by nexo and heres the link they sent me
361592,nexos official website
361593,nah that sucksbut its whataboutism you dont have to be for otter or for nexo its very possible they both are terrible
361594,well to be honest why would an user want to have fake news and slander on his twitter profile we live in a world where public and social media has a big effect on people and companys reputation if somebody publishes this information in a newspaper without actual facts but only speculation and wrong information they will be sued i am pretty sure you wouldnt like twitter random users big or small sharing wrong or embarrassing information about you
361595,just my point of view of course i prefer to read than spread information
361596,voyager digital says issuing default notice to three arrows capitalvoyager digital says three arrows capital failed to make payments on loan of 15250 bitcoin and 350 million usdc
361597,if you ever see a post with comments disabled in the future we very skeptical i tweeted about this last night actually but these fake nouns guys have been able to fool a lot of folks since twitter hacks are relatively uncommon vs discord ones i guess sorry about you lobster
361598,nobody likes to have something false spread about them youre right its probably happened to us all and it really sucks the questions here imo are not that though theyre more1 is there another avenue to get false information removed than threatening suits2 is having information removed forcefully the best way to solve a bad pr situation take the bored ape situation recently they instead released a very detailed debunking of the documentary about them attempting to prove the allegations false3 from a pr perspective does it do more harm than good to threaten to sue likely emptily thousands of people or does this just make others dislike you even more4 can a nonquotert hold up in court which courts who has jurisdiction5 what actual damage was done how do you prove it in the various courts if you do how do you collect from a bunch of anons protip you probably dont
361599,thanks ser but why do i need an air gap if i use a hard wallet ledger nano x is connected to iphone via bluetooth
361600,oh do you think it only works with ledger live and not with ios metamask
361601,should probably push ledger to integrate different networks then you wont need metamask
361604,yeah
361607,point is also there are different implementation of walletconnect from dapps especially with layer2uniswap expects you to select the network in the wallet1inch lets you select the network which is then encoded in the walletconnect connection which is actually imho the correct way to implement it
361608,ledger live supports wallet connect though doesnt it it certainly does on desktop
361610,hey guys do you have any idea why vai depegged is it due to them accepting ust and luna as collaterals
361611,its been depegged for a while now like for over a year
361612,venus had a few instances of bad collateral and as a result bad debt
361613,oracle manipulation as well as some weird collateral onboarding which was clearly a scam
361614,yes i wanted to understand the reason as it is a dai fork so i was wondering what went wrong with them if you have any more info id be very grateful
361615,whats with all of these stablecoin projects playing some shenanigans under the hood bad for market and certainly bad for them
361616,quick money
361622,sad to see
361623,i also cant wrap my head around the popularity of undercollateralized stablecoins aka algorithmic ones
361624,like you dont like the mechanics they use or is it something else
361625,btwme writing a full fledged report on the state of stables been at it for a month theres just a lot and i wanted to make sure its a nice thorough coverage of the entire market its path so far and key projectsboth centralized hybrid and algorithmic hopefully offers some brutal but honest insights into the market will share soon
361626,awesome would be an interesting read
361627,theyre popular for the same reason makerdao is dabbling in increasingly centralized collateral uncapped scalability
361628,isnt my overcollateralized stablecoins growth bounded by my collaterals growthshort answer yes
361629,sp now forecasts a lowgrowth recession in 2023
361630,because numba goes up fast and then crashes even faster also something about a decentralized stable that people only care about when number is going up its like the same thing with tomb forks the idea in a vacuum is fine however introducing it into reality is dumb the argument that is also made is that it will eventually become so liquid that it will be easy to trade ok thats fine and all but whatever youre pegging to already has tons of liquidity and is usually the gas token its an extra level of nonsense but it doesnt matter as long as number is going up
361631,tomb is a lazy pasta of basis cash pretty awful example to use and color the premise of algorithmic stablecoins with
361632,either way rather those experiments than ossifying around custodial fiatcoins and thinking everything is okay
361633,do you include overcollateralized stablecoins when you say algorithmic
361634,no that cant be
361635,yeah thats exactly what i thought but his message made me think otherwise
361636,im noting that tomb forks and algostables are stupid their main draw is that number goes up no one actually wants them to be stable
361637,hmm it depends on the contextliquitys stability is dependent on the same sort of algorithm to get it back to the peg and there are no humans tweaking any global parameters adjusting it to the current market conditions do you consider that algorithmic
361638,no cause its overcollateralized
361639,otherwise anything in the world is an algorithm because you need food to survive so its a process
361640,perhaps the overarching categories need a revamp managed stablecoins dai and usdc and automated stablecoins lusd
361641,there is general consensus that algo stables are those that have 1 peg or redemption in full only via algos not overcoll
361642,thank you thats a distinction that doesnt seem clear to people in the space i even started to doubt my understanding when someone said dai was algorithmic because of its line of defense using mkr
361643,yeah im aware but i start questioning it in the presence of liquity which is very much overcollateralized but nohumansinchargetweaking like an algorithmic stablecoin purports to work
361644,hello guys how much u spend on one account doing tasks on rabbithole a
361645,
361646,some publicly listed miners have reported sales of btc in may and june to increase liq as well although publicly listed miners only account for 20 of hashrate
361647,
361649,is there a wikiblog w the best resources on all things zk
361651,i have a few on my compendium just go to this section and search for zk
361652,deleted it seems
361653,
361654,anyone got sources for alex mashinsky supposedly being on the run
361655,find it hard to believe they can place someone on flight risk without putting them into custody
361656,you can be put on dnf without an actual charge if there is an ongoing investigation
361658,thats true would police show up at the airport though to enforce this
361659,was this
361660,thanks
361661,yeah if it was a public airport the dhs wouldnt allow entry at a private one people would show up to stop it mashinsky was flying out of a private one supposedly
361662,
361663,what was this about
361664,seems like curve pricing so i thought it was interesting maybe even new but didnt get to read
361666,sauce no idea what to make of it
361668,someone should just call the airport
361669,and ask what happened lol
361674,nan
361675,nah fam google the basics
361676,maybe we should make a new version of let me google that for you but lobsters edition
361677,ew
361678,eth nyc was filled w sbt simps
361679,i hope you were just drunk 247 because idk what you could have been doing with a bunch of jpegpersonality people
361680,i was mentoring hackathon when i shoulda been drunk 247
361681,isnt that the same thing
361682,anything cool
361683,anyone know a tradfi fund betting against tether that i can interview
361684,there was a vc guy named kyle that invested 8 figs in loot was it 3ac kyle or someone else
361685,thats multicoin lol
361686,it was the multicoin kyle and he publicly with honour accepted that loss tbh
361687,looks like some made up bullshit there are not much hedge funds in existence of the size required to even try what they talking about
361688,still dont understand why people got excited about it
361689,because vitalik tweeted about it and it was by a well known web2 founder
361690,high on bullrun missed out on nft first wave project created by some reknown web2 startup founder etcetc
361691,lol sounds like a degen aping then
361692,its good that the wework founder launched his project nowif it would have been during a bull run then imagine the degen aping lol
361693,wut there are plenty of idiots with money
361694,to attack tether you need billions isnt it stupid to tell someone you are going to attack tether in their position
361695,not something you want to leak as hedge fund trying to do this
361696,attack and short are 2 different things
361697,not really you can be openly besrish and short stuff
361698,how is it different in this case
361699,releasing your research for a short isnt anything out of the ordinary
361700,attack assumes there is some financial vector you can exploit shorting just assumes the market will agree with your thesis
361701,its very different
361702,yeah all hedge funds who wants to profit from their hidden trading idea always release their research to public smells like zeus capital
361703,
361704,still the scariest thing in crypto rn
361705,the market is broke and broken
361706,look at oi usdt perp is the top 5 oi now
361707,dumb trade
361708,if usdt goes every exchange goes under
361709,good luck getting your money
361710,not every but most will be affected
361711,ftx is one of those that wont
361712,lol
361713,how can you say that
361714,lol
361715,because they dont use tether as underlying stable coin for their trading pairs
361716,isnt bankman the biggest tether printer
361717,good point but usdt is still used as collateral
361718,yes which is why will be affected binance for the same risks implemented busd pairs and slowly switching futures to them also usd too
361719,speaking of stuff going under hypothetically what happens to all that defi stuff
361720,guess thats only 610mm according to 24h average lending
361722,look up hindenburg research and their role in exposing nikola research for shorts comes out all the time if you have identified a weakness in a system and can profit a lot when that weakness surfaces trying to get as many eyes on it as possible is the smarter play instead of keeping it hidden and paying a premium
361723,the reason zeus capital was shit because what they did was a hit piece with no prior history
361726,theoretically makes sense if you filled your massive position already fill before shill but this can be identified if they did right
361727,the spreadsheatooooorrrrr
361729,imagine trying to extrapolate in crypto
361730,like everyone identified 3ac going bankrupt or celsius insolvency
361732,well its different every cycle someone going bankrupt tbh no biggies in my opinion usdt case is much bigger
361733,you can identify the open interest sudden massive increase of usdt shorts
361735,you might be right speedy maybe fttbnb is the real usdt trade
361736,the problem isnt idenitfying but how expesive shorting without a clear timeline is
361737,ie even if u knew luna was abou tto go under celsius cant pay out it would have been cheaper to just short btc
361738,what next now that 3ac has defaulted
361739,lobsterdao does leverage buy out
361740,why do u think ivangbi has been working on gearbox all these days
361741,back when soros broke the pound his nickname in the market was the palindrome he borrowered to the hilt to short the pound then the interdealer brokers started the rumours that the palindrome was short and we all knew what that meant everybody and his dog started pressuring the peg i can remember one broker shouting down the squawk box a number 9999999 below the peg silence and the peg broke eventually norman lamont came out and admitted defeat soros made 1bln there are definetely funds out there big enough to try and break tether theres 68billion plus what you can earn shorting bitcoin i suppose getting paid may be an issue they can short bitcoin on the cme the fact that the trade exists and it has not broken tells us something
361742,dont drag soros into this mess poor guy just wants to go for the jugular
361743,goldman sachs invested in circle
361744,big tradfis are everywhere they could do anything with a small financial market like crypto
361745,especially with a illiquid market
361746,it is called the wild west after all
361747,as long as tether is not lying all will be alright truth always wins in the long term
361748,everytime these guys try to break the peg its a free donation event for alameda and squad i am however glad pegs get tested so natural selection results in best winner
361749,
361750,eos solana now sorry i dont make the rules
361751,april fools sure came late this year
361753,
361754,the argument about dpos being inferior to pos still stands with staking pools such as lido
361755,lobs milady dont cancel me
361756,
361757,
361758,is there a tldr on the entire makerdao dramawhats at stake here dai peg
361759,
361760,huh
361761,nan
361762,how about ctrlf
361763,
361764,
361765,heyi am currently writing an article about what ohm is at the moment as i understand it it has changed a lot from the moment most early defi degens remember iti would like to describe all the current mechanics of the protocolcould someone please send me any info which can help me
361766,go google their is a paper by tarun et al
361767,thanksit will describe all current available mechanics
361768,first the affliate links now shilling eos vitalik got liquidated last weekend didnt he
361769,i thought this was a joke apparently not lol
361770,nan
361771,little update in the world of numio if you want to check out what weve been up to
361772,
361773,ftx looking to buy robinhood
361774,hood sold a lot of stock now hood will buy ftx
361775,
361776,so in this paper i will find all protocol mechanics that are currently available
361781,robinhood has 62b cash on the balance sheet and mcap is 8b right now sam already owns 76 through one entity iirc so i think it would require a decent premium if the deal comes to fruition fwiw
361782,vlad not the type to dump into market weakness as well he was a seed in terra so he definitely is into crypto and their latest defi wallet announcement indicates they really wanna try to get more involved with the space as well
361783,they are going to lose that money in less than 2 years sir
361784,should be sold at a discount but sbf is a degen and might pay a premium
361785,operating at a massive loss every quarter at the moment
361786,does ledger live support optimism and arbitrum via wallet connect
361789,vlad and baiju own the majority stake50 and the report states the talks are internal within the ftx but yeah if their pfof revenue disappears it might make sense to get the deal done
361790,vlad such a good person selling data to hedge funds and halting trading for retail during public squeezes such a nice guy
361791,does anybody know for sure if androidmetamaskledger works
361792,sorry prob a lame question but can someone share your experience using gmxyz it looks like fbs ui unsure whats the web3 factor here i get paid to post or something lol
361793,how will he get that much money
361794,somehow the lower crypto prices go the more cash rich sbf gets you can do the math
361795,lmao but this much like we are talking about 89b
361796,are you sure about this seems highly unlikely that founders have 50 of the shares they have been dumping on retail since the listing btw with sec insider sells being public
361797,the burning man part lets you know what you are dealing withthat should be a chrome browser extension for linkedin searches would be useful to know whos a burner and who isnt thats the center of the universe for various intelligentsia getting kompromat on tech founders early in their trajectory still people go and act like fools to those inside the ecochamber everyone else is just a normie who doesnt get itto their vc backers they love the arrogance because their exuberance fuels the exit liquidity for lps the cult atmosphere is almost encouraged to the average crypto plebeian who doesnt have 10k to go trip acid with brock pierce and his band of merry weirdos it all just looks like a big classist secret handshake club wrapped in virtue signaling i know its not just saying thats what it all looks like from the outside looking in
361798,they own 8 and 8 but its a multiclass structure where they might hold significantly more voting power
361799,sam is the most benevolent man in crypto dont speak ill about his grand design
361800,robinhoods dual class structure means the shares sold to retail investors and institutions carry one vote while the shares held by its cofounders vlad tenev and baiju bhatt carry 10 votes per share
361802,it surprises me a lot on how much hate gets from what it looks he is even trying to save blockfi customers assets while morgan creek is trying to save investors share the former seems a better approach for the industry as a whole even if he might benefit financially in the future
361803,nan
361804,indeed would be kind of bizarre if the man who is doing so much for the face of effective altruism is a closet megalomaniac
361805,definitely that would suck and based on his track record there is no red flag i see yet
361806,
361807,hood ftxs ceo there are no active ma conversations with robinhood rtrslivesquawk
361808,psa some theres a serious bug with metamask right now be careful when submitting transactions cost me 6 figures they are investigating it
361809,initiate a transaction to a random wallet address without the 0x at the start should be 64 characters instead of 66
361810,heres vitaliks for example ab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b
361811,act as if youre going to send usdc usdt or weth
361812,dont click submit but take a look at the final wallet that metamask would send tokens to and lmk if it doesnt match what you pasted in
361813,it would send funds to this instead of what was entered
361814,not sure why it no longer adds the 0x or says invalid address but something is seriously wrong there
361815,that address is empty tho
361816,yeah its just an example try with any wallet address
361817,why would people send a transactions without 0x
361818,metamask used to add 0x automatically
361819,seems like a very unusual scenario
361820,certain exchanges show it without 0x
361821,so if youre copy pasting an address it could get screwed up
361822,so you sent to an adress without the 0x and it went to a random one
361823,yeah
361824,it used to add the 0x if needed if you try it on metamask mobile it says invalid address or something like that
361825,but on the desktop version it just makes up a random address and thats where your tx goes
361826,each 64 character address goes to one specific random wallet address
361827,weird
361828,0x is a prefix to indicate the number is in hexadecimal rather than in some other base ethereum addresses are hexadecimal
361829,still no reason to make up a random wallet address and doesnt explain why it only happens on certain tokens and not others its just very weird overall
361830,sending eth adds the 0x
361831,so why wouldnt it do that on all tokens
361832,specifically usdc usdt and weth it doesnt do that for
361833,i havent looked at anything else
361834,this
361835,not prefixing it probably tries to see if its an ens name
361836,could be but why does metamask add the prefix if youre sending eth and not if youre sending weth
361837,if it did it on all tokens that would be one thing but its clearly a software bug tons of ppl have replicated it
361838,no clue bro your linking cn etherscan so assuming ur in china so not sure about how chrome ext work over the wall
361839,lol no cn etherscan just works better
361840,im in the us
361841,what version are you running
361842,chrome and metamask and did u report an issue
361843,most recent 10151
361844,yeah i reported it they thought it was a clipboard virus but given that everyone else can replicate it as well its clearly not
361845,uhh are you using mobile
361846,link
361847,this happened on desktop
361848,i reported it directly i have an email chain with them they wanted my logs and whatnot not sure if theres a public place where i should report it
361849,report an issue
361850,email support is always useless
361851,would my assets be secure with lobster
361852,here or somewhere else
361853,on github
361854,
361855,nan
361856,nan
361857,nan
361858,recent events were not a bail out but rather a consolidation by much larger institutional players
361859,which site is this mate
361860,is this satire
361861,the winners are chosen and preselected at that level he was placed where he was to execute on a larger mission a mission he may not even fully understand yet but his handlers are happy to guide him towards the desired outcomes not saying hes a plant as much as a useful tool for now when they are done with him there will be new ones to take his place eagerly
361862,institutional capital is manipulating markets to consolidate assets and equity nothing new just another douchebagel doing their bidding whether knowingly or unknowingly
361863,this is the original twitt i dont much about the writer but if it true it seems like ftx taking over celsius might allow depositors to get their money back
361864,wut
361865,its called raising cash at euphoric levels and using it when everyone else is ded
361866,no conspiracy here just business
361867,no conspiracy just rich people consolidating wealth same as it ever was
361868,some rich people lost money some rich people are consolidating wealth
361869,breaking money buys stuff
361870,breaking your hands if you dont stop posting random shit mfka
361871,ps just joining the joke no bans all good
361872,how very nice of him nary another motive in sightremind me again why are we pretending a serial opportunist and prolific pdr is anything but
361873,copium and bag bias mostly
361874,because you cant have a bull run without a billionaire being haloed
361875,ofc its business as usual isnt depositors getting back their money better than share holders being bailed out even if depositors were supposed to know the risks they are taking majority never thought this would happen blockfi marketing played a roleon the other side share holders know the risks they are taking ie losing their money on blockfi shouldnt surprise them
361876,it may be better depending on your persuasion but not sure how that is a good excuse to start pretending this is some very nice altruistic guy sticking up for poor unsuspecting users
361877,someone as blind as a bat can see hes bailing out us retail in order to mitigate contaigon to set the stage for ftx growing why does this take seem controversial to yall youre arguing over the same thing
361878,not sure who youre referring to but er okay i guess
361882,i can agree with it too much effectsdesigns better be a simple direct with quiet voice lower music it would be more professional that way
361883,any articles about uniswap routing if possible
361884,can i hear some opinions about your best dex guys if we are evaluating them and we have to choose 1 what it would be and why the kpis or metrics you look for and what is deceiving eg trading volume consist of big indirect trades and big of mev transactions so 50 of trading volume is real
361887,looks like the conversation bots have gotten an upgrade
361888,oh you are the co founder you are the md or the other co founder he was always a model for me hehe final year medical student here lol
361889,good that you noted me first day here
361890,yes im the md
361891,adding upanyone saw an article about mev volumeprofit in other chains other than ethis there a big difference like the tps gas fees latency and such can affect how much the mev bots can profit so anything other than ethereum will have less mev botsdont know actually i am just asking cuz i am looking over the dex world and one of the big problems are those arbmev botsalso how far oracle informed amms solved this issue
361894,is gainzy on tg
361895,why
361898,if another pleb would want to express their opinion on sbfs inner motives and share their valuable opinion in here they will be rotting in ban section forever too much pleb crap will start permamuting
361899,any thread about mev in eth l2
361900,please if you found just mention me and if you have any about other chains than eth would be glad
361901,not a thread but pretty good
361902,i think the mev days has some nice vids too
361903,22 cross domain mev is what you are looking for
361904,
361905,just wanna make it clear how much of a clown moron he is
361906,we dont need to discuss it its just need to be understood
361907,john wang got one for you
361913,hey toby you have any updates on your situation
361915,1password is goated
361916,1password is also what i use for mac i think its supposed to be the best
361917,keepassxc
361919,dashlane
361920,the best software in the list actually true open source choose keepassxxc if speaking about more centralised services id chose bitwarden
361921,1password does have a function to store your see phrase password etc but its up to you whether you trust 1p for it i personally wont do it not sure whether anyone else has any experience to share
361922,nan
361923,this is how the page for storing crypto wallets on 1 password looks like
361924,hell naw pw only my seed stays on paper
361925,open source 300 contributors on github 13k stars its not as good as going yourself through the code but its not a shadysuspicious project
361926,1password does have a tutorial for phantom wallet solana if you want to have a look at it and get your own opionion on it
361927,hello please i need some help i was hacked and the was sent to mexc does anyone have contacts there that could help me
361928,wow what a disingenuous take i warned you see message above that you have to wait for bonder liquidity or alternatively wait for the l2 exit window if you learn how to withdraw manually via the contracts you bridged anyway and now call them a rug is clout that important to you svanevik are we attacking the few good trustless protocols now for clout
361930,idc about the dex i trade where slippage doesnt bother me kek
361931,thoguths on watchpug audit firm yes i controlled fd
361932,relatively good unproven reputation theyve gotta prove themselves to be more established meaning if they fuck up theyre donezo they audit carefullyhowever they could have limited reputation because their work is bad too hard to say either way
361933,ty ser
361934,it literally didnt warn in the ui anymore it took 27 hours to complete the bridging after some dude flicked a switch when its advertised as quick and trustless and im the one whos disingenuousi understand it takes time to build products but this was a garbage user experience i cant be the only one
361935,
361936,literally the only reason anyone uses hop is because they launched a token in a desperate attempt to stay relevant get exit liquidity as bull market wound down same shit with optimism it functioned fine for yrs without one use stargate anyswap instead
361937,anyswap is one of the expensive bridges depending on what you swap i would rather check other bridges not many people talk about them but some has better liquidity and less fee usually hyped bridges sucks never used stargate tho
361938,have you tried our bridge on plasma finance
361939,just to compare the fees
361940,can run a bitwarden server too
361941,can anyone recommend a captcha bot for tg channel that would allow custom question
361942,no it dosent there is this open issue in the old repo
361943,can anyone recommend any service to check smartcontracts for scam honeypot etc
361944,did i miss something since when following of famous people will prove any security
361945,
361946,
361947,
361949,yea i can attest plasma finance bridge is great
361950,no i say just because some famous account follows a project dosent mean its safeits a bad metric
361951,additionally if i would be a public figure i wouldnt assoicate myself with the pw manager i trust as this gives info to a potential attack
361952,it is true that they messed up the warnings in the ui you calling a trustless noncustodial protocol a rug is still disingenuous also talking of a guy sending around tokens is disingenuous hes calling the withdraw function in a smart contract for you which every user including you could also do themselves your message sends a very different message and ultimately it will send users to bridges which are less trustlessso yea the ux was fucked up and it sucks but your messaging is very misleading which is a shame for an account with your reach
361953,the withdrawals usually happen automatically via the bonders who were overwhelmed messed up because they had to handle transactions numbers in a day that were as large as the number of all transactions during the last year the manual withdrawals are escape latches such that you dont depend on the bonders when they fuck it up
361955,assuming by wallet you mean that create new account option within metamask that makes other wallets that all share the same seed so if one is compromised they all are in short answer is yes
361956,passphrase is not necessarily the seed if he means the password one types in order to unlock metamask
361957,yeah my bad if we speak about a classic metamask unlock password then it changes everything
361959,if your seed phrase gets stolen all wallets derived from that are compromised the individual private keys are generated based on the seed phrase according to fixed rules so anyone who has your seed phrase can generate the private keys for all the wallets just like you didbut do you mean the metamask password or the seed phrase it is still not 100 clear to me what you are talking about because you usually should not enter your seed phrase anywhere on your computer if you did you need to move funds asap
361960,2 things heremetamask requires you to setup a new phrasepassword when onboarding that is phrasepassword 1 you setup your hardware wallet with a new phrasepassword when onboarding thats phrasepassword 2 when you import your hardware wallet into your metamask password 1 is used to unlock metamask and doesnt expose your hardware wallet which is phrasepassword 2
361963,that is not a passphrase passphrase is a different thing
361964,you are just unlocking your metamask account
361965,unless i misunderstood you basically one has no relation to another
361967,ah sorry maybe you are talking of something specific to trezor scuzi rest my case
361969,also add metemorphic contract contract detector
361970,
361971,
361972,nope theyre still investigating
361973,thats pretty crazy how long before it gets packaged as an eip and sold as the next generation of contract upgradeability
361974,maker governance is voting to invest 500 million in us treasury bills
361975,they should just rebrand to usdo already
361976,lets democratise metamorphism
361977,probably not since theyre planning on getting rid of selfdestruct
361978,which would break metamorphic smart contracts
361979,or rather prevent you from redeploying on the same address
361980,or to usdd oh wait that is taken oh wait nobody will care
361981,
361983,when is this eip getting implemented though
361984,probably before verkle trees for state are implemented
361985,would not like to see this ever implemented my production environment uses create2selfdestruct loops heavily to sandbox value storage cant see this actually being implemented as knowledge of the benefits of the former practice spread
361986,the important question is do the needs of your production environment outweigh the needs of the many good sir
361987,benefit to whom
361988,hard fork that bricks lots of money wont be popular hard fork
361989,create2selfdestruct is a clear abuse of a hole in ethereum design that will be closed
361990,good luck forking away then
361991,its a less gas intensive and far safer paradigm for value storage than currently accepted practices
361992,how does it brick alot of money according to the eip sendall can still be used to retrieve funds
361993,its a blow to meta transactions though
361994,create2 reverts if a contract already exists
361995,but gas is a made up measure if you want to save up on real money costs it makes sense to simplify nodes remove dubious opcodes and raise the gas limit
361996,i do not understand can you please explain how this eip bricks alot of money
361997,process is quite simple predict new contract location using create2 determinism send tokens there no contract at address no contract to exploit when ready to withdraw deploy contract to address retreive tokens call selfdestruct to save on gas
361999,if a contract already exists at the address because selfdestruct has been bricked create2 reverts iirc
362000,says exactly that in the eip
362001,few applications are affected by this change the only use that breaks is where a contract is recreated at the same address using create2 after a selfdestruct
362002,you are using a faulty metric performance must be measured as gas proportional to gas limit
362003,holes like create2selfdestruct prevent consensus for radically raising gas limit
362004,because a contract is never deployed onchain between blocks you dramatically reduce the gas expenditures incurred during a single transaction
362005,wouldnt you be able to implement a check to avoid it and redeploy somewhere else
362006,this isnt an upgradeable system good code is designed to be as immutable as possible
362007,not if you get rugged by something implemented after you designed it
362008,exactly why this is a bad eip
362009,even my auditors have started recommending the selfdestructing clone pattern because of how secure it is
362010,this is almost equivalent to permanently locking liquidity in uniswap v1 when that was all the rage and then being left for dead by v2 and doing so in v2 then getting rekt by v3 though fortunately v3 didnt go as expected in that department almost because its worse here
362011,create2selfdestruct was never an intended pattern the fact that you abuse the hole in the design shouldnt prevent closing said hole
362012,intention is irrelevant
362013,you getting bricked is not relevant either
362014,yeah we designed this in the acceptable paradigm of the chain and now its looking like the evm itself wants to pull the rug anyways firmly opposed to this eip peoples money is at stake and you cant change the rules of the game just because you implemented poor design to begin with and people followed that design
362015,on a supposedly immutable platform for building what should be immutable contracts
362016,funny stuff
362017,ethereum never gave you a promise that evm wont ever change
362018,lol
362019,the pattern challenges the very fabric of the immutability from a users pov though
362020,somehow were not applying frontier opcodegas rules today
362021,it was a fair assumption that methods that allowed value to be stored and accessed wouldnt change under our feet
362022,perhaps we should do away with the apparent farce of having immutable contracts because who knows what other unexpectedness needing a hardfork they will discover in the future eh
362023,certainly i dont think anyone used our system with the assumption that the evm might make changes that made their value inaccessible
362024,except sload gas was tweaked more than one time and it did brick someone
362025,i dont think this is true it did give that promise but its understandble that things have to change
362026,as far as i know the eip is still a draft seems like some people want things to change but that doesnt appear to be a foregone conclusion
362027,last i checked the design was pretty much finalized and discussed through and through on allcoredevs
362028,isnt this the point of sendall to allow for siphoning out residual value
362029,in that case perhaps they should consider changes to the behavior of create2 as well
362030,because a lowlevel change that just bricks at least one valuestorage system isnt exactly a good look particularly when none of this was done with the desire to exploit anything more to increase security
362031,the platform for building static contracts until the next hardfork good base
362032,at least 70k contracts impacted
362033,people cry about cruft in things like windows and js both of which would much rather twist themselves into elaborate pretzels than knowingly going ahead with bricking functioning programs because oops unexpected interaction
362034,perhaps vitalik losing his wow thingy was justified he was never promised permanence after all
362035,kind of interesting that youre looking at metamorphic contracts with such disdain when your own contracts use the same mechanism although they arent metamorphic
362036,breaking one use case would likely necessitate breaking the other
362037,thats like saying we should get rid of delegatecall because upgradeble contracts can be used to rug
362038,nobodys saying that we should
362039,the reason behind gettting rid of them is to pave way for verkle trees rugs were not taken into consideration
362040,if you participated in the first week of arbitrum odyssey and bridged to arbitrum using hop protocol you can claim your nft herefunny enough you will get nfts on polygon information for the coming weeks can be found here
362041,fraxusdc is now an official base pool
362042,so the question we should be asking ourselves is having verkle tree worth bricking some contracts whether or not its a flaw in ethereum is superfluous imho
362043,can bridgeless protocols like magpie mitigate these bridging hacks through a bridgless mechanism
362046,are there any good cryptoweb3 research sources offering data driven deep dives like messaridelphiblock without a paywall hard to find any organised source for this
362047,i have lots of different blogs and newsletters here on my compendium that may help
362049,btw why do you need selfdestruct again you can omit the selfdestruct part
362051,the code is already live and has been in use for months
362052,
362053,sandboxed counterfactual storage systems rely on selfdestruct to effectively function if that were removed and create2 wasnt changed to not revert on existing contracts that would brick the system
362054,not to wish ill will upon you but with a title as leading as strongest security in defi for this article its possible its only a matter of time before youre going to be eating a hat ser blockchain security is far too complex to use superlative language
362055,very interesting tech nonetheless and certainly innovative but maybe frame it as increased security comparative to other vaults
362056,already dealt with such before this was the result of a long upgrade process to ensure hacks would be far more difficult to pull off on complexity to steal value rather than o1 which is pretty good as valuestorage systems go that said appreciate the feedback
362057,
362058,jesus
362059,i dont see how it would be safe if you redeploy the same contract many times as opposed to simply deploying and using
362060,because most of the time there is no contract at the token storage address lowers surface area dramatically
362061,if the contract is deployed its fairly trivial to run a trace and get its code unless you expect script kiddies who only know etherscan
362062,actually etherscan too supports parity traces so your point is invalid
362063,having lower surface area isnt about your code being closed source
362064,its about having fewer points that exist as attackable vectors
362065,contracts that only live for a single transaction arent open to attacks outside of that transaction
362067,what kind of take is thatthey are three guys building in this space since years innovative protocols first a smart contract wallet in 2019 then the cross chain messaging hop protocol connext now pivoted their bridge to hops model because it works and before building those things they worked as smart contract auditorsthey launched the token after the recent crypto crash when hop was already the most used l2 bridge during the bull market do anyswap and stargate not have a tokendid you ever saw their performance on days where they had to process 100000 transactionsi remember waiting hours for my funds in the anyswap bridge during the fantom craze i suspect most of us do scroll back in this chat so what is this take seriously

362072,nan
362073,hey guys anyone have info about treasury bored ape kennel club where i can find it doing some research
362074,guilty
362079,is the owner of wallet nftmaximal in here they also own a lobbie and a bunch of meta angels and recently bought an ma from a compromised account im trying to help connect the victim with the buyer to see if theyll sell it back
362080,is that an ad on github damn brave fucking sucks lmao
362081,its an ad in the browser not on any particular site said ads are something you turn on or off depending on whether youre interested in the rewards for viewing them
362082,fozzysbo
362083,
362084,been high since the last little dip and it should be high considering you can put on significant leverage without much liquidation risk
362085,average position is prolly 38x leveraged
362086,hi guys since pinata ipfs gateway changing their pricing model our expected expenses on pins and bandwidth going to increase from 23 to 1000 per month so im looking for a reliable alternatives not interested to host my own pinner any thing you guys can recommend other than infura
362087,23 annualized funding 3x leverage is pretty attractive tbh
362088,yeah exactly imagine all those articles recently are psyops to squeeze last juices of retail
362089,100mln total oi added recently
362090,dont think its hedge funds lol
362091,fleek moralis
362092,its prolly the most attractive bet outside of just using aave
362093,attractive as in if your gonna short tether
362094,what gets interesting is if there is like 2b in oi and someone just waits for a thin book and punts a market order in considering there is a cost to resting orders on the ask even above 1
362095,they merged my ticket into this one seems like theyre now aware of the issue and working on a fix
362096,anyone have any insight as to how to get reimbursed by metamask not sure if there even is a process for that in place or if i just need to get a lawyer
362097,reimbursed by metamask
362098,yeah due to a bug they introduced my transaction was misrouted to a random wallet address so my tokens didnt make it to their destination
362099,er which bug did they introduce
362100,
362101,we used to do this to create a token transfer transaction from the send screen tokentransferaddress value txparams to undefined data undefined we now do thisconst txmeta await promisifiedbackgroundaddunapprovedtransaction txparams origin_metamask type previously we would create the token transfer via libraries that depend on this from ethjsabi so validation of the hex string would fail there and the user wouldnt be able to send the transaction with the change referenced above that validation stopped
362102,well good luck reading the original thread knowingly sending tokens to a nonaddress is certainly an interesting action
362103,
362104,crust
362105,how do you know this pr introduced the bug that affected you so sorry to here about your loss in between
362106,lol is it ok to share this idk if you can see this lil moon but can you un block me lmfao
362107,was coming to post the same as an aside i hate how telegram isnt doing expansion of links properly anymore
362108,it is
362109,its twitter thats having issues
362110,sure whats ur twitter
362111,telegram
362112,nan
362113,you need to play around with all the cruft they now stick to the end of their links to get it to show the preview
362114,done lol
362116,because my processes didnt change and this issue didnt occur until the recent release and they identified why it happened and are rolling back their validation removal
362117,i didnt send anything to a non address its a perfectly valid address they just changed it to a different address during the sending process
362118,if theres no 0x its not an address
362119,it didnt go to a burn address it went to a completely different address than what i entered
362120,i cant fathom how youd do that once and not thank your stars you didnt get rekt by what should normally be a mistake
362121,because they validated addresses properly until this release
362122,they compensated for it
362123,you could certainly argue they shouldve rejected the very first tx you made leading you to think you should continue with this but damn your risk tolerance must be through the roof
362124,yeas as coiner_ said github is just the tab i had when i took the screenshot
362125,is there any good article on how flashbots will work post merge
362126,i have came across a few discussion on google but doesnt seem like there is a concrete path or maybe i am reading outdated articles
362132,one of the uncommon core eth merge episodes had a good bit of discussion on it
362133,ey to pay 100 mln to settle us charges of staff cheating on accountant examsarticle comments
362134,the hilarious bit
362135,
362136,there are companies that are basically too far gone and its not practical to backstop them for reasons like a substantial hole in the balance sheet regulatory issues or that there is not much of a business left to be saved says bankmanfried who declined to name any specific crypto exchanges
362137,
362138,forbes is truly at the forefront of breaking news
362139,nice article
362141,bear markets are great for bringing drama to people you completely forgot about
362142,gensler didnt even have to lift a finger
362143,surprised no one else further developed on this point
362144,aave had usdc pegged at 1 usd and most of the positions should be in liquidation mode
362145,did aave peg usdc or was it just used as the reference asset eg on euler weth is pegged to equal 1 weth and everything is measured in those units
362146,nan
362147,chainlink
362148,as always
362149,but worked as intended
362150,ah i see
362151,but weth on ethereum isnt the same as weth on avalanche or another chain
362152,yep i totally agree
362153,entirely different assets and need their own objective pricing
362154,they cant continue to pull this shit of it was intended and no rep loss for them
362155,aave gov seems to be ok with this oracle assumption lmeow
362156,nobody evaluates bridged asset security people just wanna ape
362157,yep it really bugs me when people say we should deploy euler to other chains asap because its easy they all have different security models and the same assets are not objectively the same as we see here
362158,potential solution here could be to check it with another oracle that checks peg between eth locked assets and native chain locked assets if peg breaks operations are not allowed just spitballing but def really interesting and worth tackling tbh
362160,no just stop using chainlink or push them to report correctly chains data
362161,either implement an specific weight for the price coming from x chain if you are on that chain or something else
362162,would it be easier to check chainlink as well as the local amm and use the lower of the two prices for borrowing
362163,so basically if you are pulling all your data from cexes then add a 50 weight of a native dex from that chain because its not native usdc and you can use it as such
362164,that would be hugely problematic on lower liquidity chains and cause a whole slew of even worse issues
362165,you cant really differentiate native chain price expect for using onchain values then youre prone to the same manipulations that a lot of onchain pricing is prone towards one solution is to implement another check for those bridged assets where an oracle reports if the locked supply on eg eth matches the circulating supply on eg harmony
362166,no exchange or we gives you native usdcharmony pricing
362167,doesnt really solve the issue youre just adding a manipulation vector
362168,if they do that you just told everybody they just need to manipulate an illiquid shitcoin pair on a shitty chain to force the price downup because it counts more than what exchanges report
362169,preach
362170,can anyone explain me how loans work
362171,so if you were that oracle ser how would you price a wrapped asset the moment its underlying bridge was hacked how fast do you think you can make an assessment of how badly the particular wrapped asset was affected by it and how quickly if ever do you come to consensus with the other oracle nodes
362172,same question to vpepo
362173,sorry for a shameless plug if anyone wants to try out akula on beacon chain ropsten got an experimental branch available
362174,those who feel brave can check out vorot93merge branch and try chainropsten
362175,dont forget to bring your beacon chain node preferably lighthouse
362176,does anybody know how leveraged basis trading works lemma finance wrote an article a year ago basically saying that 2x leverage basis trading btc outperformed holding btc i cant figure out how you can even leveraged basis trade
362177,you first need to ask a more fundamental question what is the price of anything usually people say whatever someone is willing to pay for it so by that metric you need to find a recent trade for the asset in question if its some wrapped bridge asset then you need to find a price someone paid for that bridged asset not the underlying asset on some other network but the actual derivative itself thats the only truly correct way to do this you will complain that theres no way chainlink etc could be expected to do this for all bridge assets and youre right they cant fragmenting liquidity by bridging is bad news for everyone it breaks the fungibility of assets 1 wrapped abc is never worth exactly 1 abc theres almost always some discount that needs to be applied for liquidity risk cost to wrapunwrap opportunity cost and so on for bridged assets on the basis of what weve seen for the past 1218 months wrapped tokens are worth much less on average than their underlying so how do you fix this i dont think you can without having custom oracles for every asset personally i think the solution therefore lies in decentralised oracles that are derived from the underlying on a dex or group of dexs native to the environment in which something trades that way you are always getting a real price its not easy to create a secure decentralised oracle uniswap twaps arent bad but i think we can do better weve been working on this at euler
362178,nothing turns me on more than euler oracleposting that begins with you first need to ask a more fundamental question
362182,
362183,
362186,is anyone here aware about dopexs pricing mechanism
362187,options pricing you mean
362188,yes details on their model
362189,they got numbers guys better go their discord and sniff there
362190,i got this from twitter but need an elaborated version of this
362191,will try
362193,what the hell is going on with luna right now lmao
362194,the naivete of people have learned their lesson with insert in all its glory
362197,trying again in case anyone knows this person at this time of the day
362198,firstmargincall u might be banned by the rodlwide bot many defi projects use idk why tho
362202,hi guys i am not a native english speaker i want to ask how do you guys native english speaker describe behavior like thisdeposit steth as collateral borrow eth swap eth to steth repeat this loop
362203,this is done by indexcoop instadapp euler and others thats a folded strat arbing the rates
362204,soon w gearbox you will be able to take more leverage and also get yields from convex
362205,i think so thanks brother folded strata arbing
362206,i call it leveraged short eth against steth many people call it leveraged staking
362207,we call it degenerate apeing
362208,well thats what i call it
362210,btw is it jus me or arbitrums gas fees more expensive than ethereum rn
362211,odyssey
362212,yeah but if gas prices are higher doesnt that defeat the purpose
362213,nan
362214,is there any public info where i can read more about this
362215,degenscore should be posting about it today also will dm
362216,thanks
362217,hey can i write you about this or if you dont mind send me a dm would like to know more about the details
362218,does anyone have thoughts on this now dydx going for its native chain looks bearish for starknet wondering whats the real reason but based on some tweets it looks like cairo is hard to build on anyone with the opinion on polygon hermez specifically what is the tooling like is it using standard languages
362219,psa at the current average block time gray glacier is set to hit around 3am pt on june 30 if you havent done so yet upgrade your nodes
362220,leveraged market neutral long steth
362222,has anyone here worked with lens protocol wondering what you guys built and what are the limitations of the protocol
362223,antonio was on bankless yesterday the tldw is that they want to decentralise everything about dydx hence the move to cosmosthe orderbook was centralised so they felt they could decentralise it by making their own chain
362224,as long as they make onboarding easy im not too bothered dydx is a superior product
362225,ctr f most probl asssaving legal strategy some technical perks
362226,
362228,wen lunc flip luna
362230,
362231,any sers seen this any thoughts to share with plebs like me
362234,same but no idea where is safe haven anymore us bonds cos even makerdao is buying em up
362236,fud 20
362237,yea wana know if anyone has any clarity and insights thats all
362238,the relationship between usdc circle signature and silvergate has been public for a while so i guess the issue is signature and silvergate lend to shady people who default on repayments
362239,and that signaturesilvergate effectively get a 5 discount vs dollars on buying usdc
362240,after almost a decade of tether is scam usdc ends up being the one to get rekt that would be insert irony gif
362241,4d fud
362242,so ss buy usdc form circle at 95 cents on the dollar ss lend out their usdc on their platforms if one of the ss goes poof that means dollar liqudity could be an issue for usdc i guess anything im missing here
362243,this last part i do have issue withgeralt davidsoncryptoinsider235him a crypto insider so i can and need to tell you whats going on behind the curtain and it really is so very bad this is the dirty secret being kept quiet by crypto hedge funds and the big guys be careful for when this blows up peace
362244,how does one become one of these crypto insiders do you need over 500 twitter followers for that
362245,haha its ct anything can be said but just wana check if gigabrains here have any views and insights on whats being said
362246,u need to have a big ego and a small penis
362247,damn only 12 for me i wish my ego was bigger
362248,you forgot a twitter acc promised to upload tg data
362249,where can i see the approximate amount of eth stored in the smart contract
362250,not a gigabrain but i dont see anything obviously new here if signature goes down due to defaults on usdc theyve lent out then yeah itd be bad for usdc but not insurmountable as long as they can get another partner up i dont see how that would be worldending especially given how tether have run for years and busd as an alternative really trusting cz maybe people smarter than me can weigh in
362251,cool thanks for weighing in appreciate the 2cents given
362252,if youre not a gigabrain then what does that make me
362253,busd is run in a partnership with paxos so might not be reliant only on cz afaik paxos holds all the collateral etc
362254,guy has spent 3 years retweeting binance and czbusd intern working hard
362255,lmao this an an anon acc a small one rting cz for 3 years and somehow getting alpha on the biggest player in the market smells like a lot of hot garbage
362256,hitokemak protocol has feature named toke backstop afak it means that toke staked by users can be used to cover impermanent loss for lps on tokemak does anyone know if users toke were used for this purpose in recent market crash cant find info on dune andor tokemaks dashboard about how il are mitigated in reality
362257,usdc reserve assets are held at blackrock and others they are transparent and audited frequently by credible auditorsthe graphic in the tweet shows flow that the authors speculate happen to usdc after issuanceany counterparty risk to high risk lenders would be born by intermediaries such as silvergate not by circleinterest incentives circle lose ie marketing costs would be paid from circle balance sheet not from the usdc reserve assets
362258,that sounds awfully close to bancors model
362259,im not following the logic of why circle would give ss a 5 discount what service do they supposedly provide for that
362260,quite dumb fud since usdc is not circle also attestations
362261,
362262,discloses it acquired 480 bitcoins since may 3rd as of june 28 2022 microstrategy together with its subsidiaries held an aggregate of 129699 bitcoins
362263,source
362264,yeh 480 btc is huge
362265,followerwhoring tried and true
362266,in bancor everything is paired to bnt in tokemak nothing is paired with toke so the impact is of 2nd order of magnitude
362267,since were talking about users staked toke but not about tokes emission its not so bad also toke backstop is just one step of their mitigation waterfall they use assets in reserve assets in surplus toke staked protocol owned assets so i think its much better than bancor but still interesting if toke users suffered from last crash
362268,answer to this is to scroll through the twitter account and see that it consists of random retweets of public crypto accounts for several years and now this great insider is revealing hisher secrets right
362269,imo the somewhat slick graphic tells it all if this isnt followerbait idk what is and its working
362272,very regulated
362274,how to access harmony vrf within the smart contract im unable to understand from their docs
362275,absolutely none of this is actually how anything works what a joke
362276,afaik tether hasnt been fully audited at any point theyve said a few times that theyll be releasing one but i dont think ive ever come across them actually fulfilling it so the logic is consistent between usdt and usdc imo
362277,correct attestations made a 3rd party looks at their accounts for a minute but you need a more longer term transparent figure i can borrow to meet the needs of an auditor for one day i cant for months on end
362278,whats so dumb about this is that you can read the 10k from silver gate and see all their financial activity if any of this made sense it would be visible in their public docs signet is not a usdc settlement layer it only settles in usd you cant borrow against signet so dumb we must be getting towards the bottom because the quality of these posts are reaching idiotic levels
362279,
362280,yeah saw that
362282,
362283,
362284,the claim goes theyre doing it for decentralization but a decentralized cosmos chain is a slow cosmos chain
362285,i head that there was no way for them to run their orderbook on starknet i didnt follow much this dydx story as i dont use them but was what i read true
362286,decentralization can also be a term used by some protocols to please legislators when issuing tokens theyll be able to say no look dydx users use the token for fees and validators are the one it goes to its not a security
362287,it is certainly what theyd like to say whether it holds water is up for debate consider lbry a chain with the same properties is currently fighting the sec who thinks theyre a security
362288,dont know abou that just curious about starknet vs polygon or other scaling solutions
362289,lobs are there any sandwich as a service providers already for common contracts like uni curve or does one still have to monitor the mempool and create a bundle on his own
362290,thanks for sharing i never heard of lbry so ill have to look into it dydx is stating on their website that their dydx token staking is done through a safety staking pool where dydx stakers can earn rewards for securing the system what are users securing if theyre just depositing tokens in a vault and earning part of the trading fees revenue in other words arent dydx holders buying dydx and staking it only in regards of future trading fee revenue they may take a part of
362291,polygon is an l1 at the moment
362292,theyre not getting the trading fees theyre compensated by brrr to act as a backstop liquidity for margin calls afaik
362293,no chain that exists today not even cosmos can support what they want
362294,cosmos allows them control over who runs the nodes unlike starkx the decentralization angle is storytelling
362295,they could use substrate and run the orderbook in offchain workers
362296,yes of course but what about hermez its similar to what starkex is offering atm as well or no they announced the launch of zkevm testnet in july so im keeping and eye on iti would like to know how the dev tooling compares if the issue that dydx had with starknet was that cairo is hard to build on id like to know if the situation is any different for hermez
362297,oh ok
362298,anyone else getting this error on arbitrum seeing it with three different rpcs and on uniswap and gmx
362299,up the gas limit fixes it
362300,gas on arbitrum spiked due to the events will needa manual up gas limits
362301,cringe but understandable
362302,
362303,supercycled
362304,ended
362305,no proof
362306,isnt it a joke
362307,isnt that just confusion of the bvi order liquidation its the court order of the sg company and its assets not exchange liquidation
362308,superliquidation

362323,sassal0x retweeted __ ARBINAUTS FALL IN the first week or so of the arbitrum odyssey has been very exciting to say the leastbut weve decided to pause the arbitrum odyssey as of now to be resumed after nitro is released more info below
362324,sybil farmers won
362325,yep only way forwards i can think of for them is that if and when they do an airdrop that its primarily based on preodyssey activity with odyssey only acting as a multiplier or bonus
362326,this
362327,they have no incentive to call out sybil farmers now
362328,indeed better to let it play out with all the sybils doing their thing for now and then rug them later
362330,1m token oops would assume the sender is a bot but how could a bot makes such mistake and what kind of bot is this
362331,deleted
362332,
362333,odyssey will be like 10 arb per nft or something
362334,ya but x 2000 wallets your good
362335,sybil party for sure
362336,people really do that much manually
362337,arbitrum botting challenge
362338,i doubt the nfts will be directly rewarded like this much better to take a baseline from an older snapshot of activity maybe include some community style multipliers like op did and then add another multiplier for odyssey completiondepends on course of what they decide the objective of the airdrop is if there ever is one
362339,polkadot to scrap its council body in new governance system
362340,how about they are doing this for a year now same peer to pool thing live on solana mainnet
362341,
362342,argent x in trouble
362343,probably
362344,argent is also doing things on the gaming side of accounts abstraction for starknet
362345,to improve ux while gaming

362363,at chapter one
362364,and hi
362365,
362366,
362367,
362368,hey yall i am looking for a single location that allows we to automatically add multiple evm network profiles to metamask would anyone know where i can do this
362369,blockfi basically dumped 43000 bitcoin
362370,a leaked investor call revealed morgan creeks bid for blockfi here are four more big takeaways from the call
362371,
362372,can anyone recommend the best place to find historical defi lending rates
362373,with charts preferably
362374,for aave i like aavescan
362376,do you know if theres similar for compound and maker
362377,for notionals
362378,teddy also does a weekly review of defi rates here if its interesting cr1st0ff
362379,thank you
362380,
362382,where is the best place to find a comprehensive list of new nft projects
362383,a gutter
362384,maybe look at for projects that are minting this moment consider getting a or sign up to the drop mailing list in general nft related questions are best asked here
362385,so what did the eu agree to today coindesk article is a mess
362388,from the coindesk article it sounds like interacting with smartcontracts would be excempt from kyc requirements but need to kyc from exchange wallet if sum 1k eur
362389,
362390,anyone know the best place to find data on exchange inflowoutflowreserve etc
362391,sorry lots of questions on best places to find data
362392,somewhere with a python api would be amazing
362393,transposeio might have what you need
362394,anyone have any tips on the best way to calculate the value of a uniswap lp token in a way that cant be flashloaned onchain
362395,value in
362396,lets say i have two chainlink oracles and an lp token if i flashloan the pair i can manipulate the reserve0 and reserve1 numbers in a way that changes the value of the underlying lp which makes my chainlink oracles useless because the price is no longer accurateif i want to calculate the value of say yfieth in usd but in a way that cant be manipulated how would i do that with univ2
362397,you cant anything you take into account in univ2 is manipulable
362398,through a flashloan
362399,i think these nfts are audience markupmediakit
362400,for it to not be manipulable you need some kind of timeawareness queue univ3 twap oracles
362401,you can build a twap with uni v2 so i know it can be done that way
362402,hey rob yes you can but it is expensive to maintain that on ethereum mainnet for example
362403,keep3r network had some kind of oracles for uni v2 although they had a bug afaik dont remember which bug
362404,
362407,yeah we already have one live know alpha homora had something built out for this a while back want to know if it workedmoreover really want to know if this is the right way
362409,
362410,i didnt know about this sheeeet paradigm is really raising the bar in our ecosystem
362412,is there any way to easily see gnosis multisig owners and configuration x of y etc without having to load it up in to the gnosis safe ui
362413,tm compromise is the column to watch its better than the initial ep proposal but not ideal cex will have to collect information when you transfer funds from your self custody wallet to and from cex however they will only verify the information is accurate if they judge the transfer is a risky one for any transfer to from cex 1k they will ask for proof of addy ownership
362414,tomorrow there will be the final mica trilogue and there might be also a compromise between meps council and commission
362415,
362416,hey guysanyone remember theres a pic of ninesquare division with some cts inside and some of them are redcrossed because they are down bad capitulate their predictions are wrong there are ansem lightcrypto and also maybe defigod tetranode danieleits a pic i saw when jewel rugged and ansem is redcrossedtherere also sentences for each ct under their pfpfor lightcrypto i recall its bull finally capitulate or something but light isnt redcrossed yet
362418,all probably still up massively in the last 5 years
362419,yeah
362420,but i still wanna find that pic
362421,looked into it further appears you can value lps using the systems ohm developed
362422,
362423,
362424,
362425,oh shots fired
362426,its almost like they expected this
362427,if the reason for denial is market manipulation couldnt futures based bitcoin etfs be manipulated

362449,
362450,i love this guy
362451,thanks for the tag ser
362452,thank you for this if you look at their investor relations section and partners this would be a bold faced lie which albeit given current climate wouldnt be surprising at least circle has done the most at being transparent with most of their collateral
362455,this must be a joke from hasu
362456,
362457,nice thank you
362458,i guess i understand nikolai a bit more now lmao
362459,nan
362460,the mstable discussion of 2 yrs ago
362461,dai was everything it supposed to be a stable uncensored store of value but no they wanted to make it better and now here we are on the verge of dai demise
362462,idk about demise but without jokes managers are doing some fucking weird shit
362463,why didnt anyone just clone the single collateral dai model as a backup i dont count rai
362464,lusd is close enough to that tbh
362465,got a repo link
362466,trying to jump in the convo could you guys explain why expanding the number of collateral for maker is a threat i need to connect the dots
362467,expanding any number if anything adding risks thats fine as it needs to grow but adding semi fake stables who will compete for psm is a way to get another ust run basically they are trying to make curve which makes not much sense to my small brain adding rwa or not is a subjective other issue not commenting on that per se
362469,maybe ungovernance was the right answer for stablecoin providers honestly impressed by the solidity of liquity
362471,nan
362472,nothing subjective about rwas ser theyre voting to invest in us treasuries using a fiatcoin as collateral was a bad enough nail in the coffin now its for all intents and purposes a fiatcoin with more dishonest marketing
362473,you do realize that any usd stable is implicitly pegged to fiat either way
362474,oh please this is grasping at straws to excuse something clear cut
362475,no its fundamental if you are so concerned with fiat going tits up then any coin pegged to it by definition will got tits up with it they are literally designed to do that
362476,good thing i dont have such a concern then
362477,even simpler than that just hit the guys twitter and scroll down its rts all the way mostly cz and binance
362478,that currencies have a variety of pegs to each other and especially to the dollar doesnt mean we need to wrap it
362479,its not that concern its sticking collateral and the decentralized money into a bloody treasury bond thing not the same
362480,are they actually investing collateral or their treasury eg would this lead to dai being less than 100 onchain collateralized
362481,treasury lol
362482,they sold 500m of their fiatcoin collateral and are deciding which of the treasury thingies to buy now
362483,is it just me or are people conflating those things in this discussion or is there an argument to be made that its somehow the same
362484,what do you think people supposedly making this conflation are concerned about
362485,tell me
362486,im asking what you think
362487,probably comes down to various degrees of decentralization concerns because you can not translate that offchain the same way it works onchain
362488,do you believe there are degrees of decentralization in usdtusdcbusdetc
362489,no they are designed the same way and controlled by central parties
362490,exactly
362491,what i meant was that i assume that people who oppose the treasury bond thing have different degrees of concerns which boil down to decentralization concerns
362492,but instead of asking a ton of leading questions you could just state your position so we can move on here
362493,but so much more fun this way
362494,position they are submitting a lot of their assets to the suits they were supposed to stay away fromi am not advocating to go raistyle keep the dollar peg but dont give your money awayimho
362496,to be clear where the money comes couldnt me more irrelevant
362497,so given this vote is almost certainly going to go through what do you think is the difference between usdcusdtbusdetc and dai
362498,it becomes a more complex and a more open usdc but with more risks truly this time
362499,dai can not be frozen dai is still onchain overcollateralized
362500,or not
362501,ill preface that with saying it was already a questionable construct when they forced in usdc but surely there are no ambiguities this time
362502,if either of those change as a result i understand the concerns if not i dont
362503,i might as well buy diamond ico behind a smart contract owned by swiss ag
362504,dai is still onchain overcollateralizedthis time it becomes so entrenched its practically literally usdc with governance on top
362505,again the question is whether those bonds are a treasury investment of if they actually replace a critical amount of dai onchain collateral
362506,over 80 of dais overcollateral is a series of assets that can be frozen in a single click it is no more onchain overcollateralized than your money in a cex is onchain overfully collateralized
362507,would dai not be collateralized anymore if the full 500m get lost
362508,could any guide me to list of blockchain based crowd funding projectsi know some names1 ampnet2 labs groupplease suggest yours
362509,wait what
362510,why the shock mate
362511,the point isnt the collateralization rate or where the collateral comes from this second one is well and truly irrelevant not sure who is concerned about it its what the collateral is
362512,these seem weird ser
362513,at some point it does not make sense to stack infinite amounts of the same collateral i agree that maker should maintain the vast majority of collateral in liquid and decentralized cypto assets but if it keeps growing theres no issue with diversifying
362514,it may but again is this a decentralized stablecoin or a fiatcoin with misdirection on where the freeze button lies
362515,sorry for making it weird in simple words my company needs funding for its palm oil busniess in malaysia banks are delaying the process of loan approval
362516,the amount of usdc collateral is the bigger problem here imho
362517,the perfect trojan it was
362518,i still remember people replying its temporary when i said it was nigh unlikely to ever get removed now its us treasuries lol wen commercial paper
362519,soooon
362520,i mean its a real problem there are not many liquid and non volatile assets in the space
362521,wasnt dai supposed to be the nonvolatile asset
362522,yeah but in order for it to be that it must be collateralized by assets that can be sufficiently liquidated if shit hits the fan i am not sure whether btc and eth can serve that function under extreme conditions
362523,this is so strange to me how did we go from trying to create a construct that through some mechanism tames volatility to seeking nonvolatile assets to back our supposed tamer
362524,fuck you alex
362525,over time those were the only ones that withstood any critical condition
362526,if we had those already wed be using those things not its wrapper
362527,i agree but if you extrapolate that against an every growing dai supply they might not
362528,same as frax serbasically i see that dai has perfect pmf for those who gonna use usdc but avoid an issue of personal transfers lock risks usdc is able to freeze your account dai cantthis is real use case of dai frax and other stables which are basically wrappers for usdc
362529,i mean you can virtue signal here all you want but its a complicated issue and the solution is not apparent
362530,you can meme about liquity all day but its irrelevant in terms of scale and if it scales would run into the same issues
362531,liquity exists
362532,too slow
362533,lol
362534,what came first the ever growing dai supply or the ambition of expanding beyond onchain censorship resistant collateral
362535,the problem isnt that its slow its that they refuse to settle for adequate
362536,i am not taking makers side here in principle but i dont think its hard to see that theres a real problem that has not been solved
362537,ironic considering that behavior is the one underlying the selling point of algo stables they trip over themselves to attack
362538,on the matter of an overcollateralized censorship resistant stablecoin with no humans prodding and tweaking parameters it has most certainly been solved with as pristine a solution as you can possibly get liquitybut just because i believe that doesnt mean i believe liquity has solved the problem of a scalable stablecoin
362539,i think people started thinking ahead and thats where the ambition came from i would like to assume that the maker people are neither stupid nor acting in bad faith at least at the core
362540,i mean with liquity you have the perfect solution for your ideology people can choose so we should be all good here and let maker experiment with the other route
362541,the reality is maker realized theres a scaling cap on a token collateralized by a singular asset thats what sai dai was about the problem is they think they can solve that by adding ever more exotic collateral to the mix while selling themselves as decentralized and censorship resistant because at least the freeze button is underneath the covers
362542,yeah but whats the alternative they basically abandon the whole thing as it is and let it run
362543,they decided to run the whole thing in a governance style and this is the result
362544,this is what nikolai is saying i feel like ye
362545,if their end goal was to deploy some immutable steady state solution they could have done so ages ago
362546,i dont have a problem with maker experimenting lets be honest we know what is happening ive never really been a fan of maker anyone that was active in ccr probably remembers this largely due to their impressively elaborate gubernance i do have a problem with them selling the lie that theyre decentralized anything and certainly defis biggest decentralized stablecoin
362547,you can oppose what they are doing but i think what maker has been doing for the past 2 years is one of the most interesting things to follow you can now claim that its all nonsense and that you fully understand all the implications but i doubt it theres much insight to be gained from this meanwhile keep calm and use liquity
362548,
362549,gov stepped in
362550,well theres definitely insight to be gained but we take different things from itas for understanding the implications of what theyre doing well your answer to makes it pretty clear the difference here is im less willing to give them the benefit of the doubt
362551,and let there be no confusion i see overcollateralized stablecoins as an inferior product so while i consider liquity to be the quintessential overcollateralized stablecoin that doesnt mean i think experimenting with stablecoins should be stopped or whatever
362552,you asked for differences there not similarities i know what kind of answer you were fishing for
362553,tbf i was fishing for excuses
362554,i just do not think it becomes a real risk before their share of onchain collateral drops beyond a certain threshold
362555,having some realworld collateral while still being onchain overcollateralized does not turn dai into usdc
362556,absolute worst case they lose 500m best case they can tap into that if something goes seriously wrong on the onchain side of things plus they generate some yield
362557,
362558,dai basically becomes a blackrockcontrolled asset
362559,yeah thats an ideological argument from a practical pov it does not matter given the above conditions are met otherwise walk me through it please i dont see it
362560,whats ideological about it
362561,what is this practical pov youre talking about it seems to me we have wildly different ideas of what dai is supposed to be is it a decentralized censorship resistant stablecoin or is it some sort of onchain investment fund via a lowvolatility wrapping asset
362562,nan
362563,now scale up this mini debate happening into a couple years of governance politics and we have the outcome were currently observing
362564,nice that means i win
362565,at what cost sir at what cost
362566,if you are conceding its the second then well that is the point
362567,just kidding i understand both sides i am just opposed to shutting down the whole exploration of additional collateral as long as it does not become the main collateral in the sense that in terms of a 100 redemption it would be needed to be liquidated
362568,just a part of your master plan for nfts to be the next stage of maker collateral
362569,nfts is my regen therapy recovering from defi black swans
362570,the solution is to complain in twitter and posts while waiting for bitcoin to have smart contracts
362571,gm does anybody know if its still possible to get tickets to ethcc in paris might be on the secondary
362572,btw liquity is a chainlink side project by definition is at the mercy of the chainlink upgrade mechanismdoesnt feel like a decentralized mechanismit does boil down to an oracle issue in a multitude of cases for rwas and on chain assets
362573,oracle design is underexplored
362574,no liquity isnt and if its redundancy system fails then it doesno oracles are the least of the problem when talking about rwas the problem is the rw part of rwaand yes oracle design is definitely underexplored
362575,lol wat
362576,guys can explain how it works the project opened on twitter on june 25 mint on june 29 there was an instant sold out 6 minutes there was no advertising anywhere on twitter full free mint how does it works closed chats or did they increase the volume themselves 1nft per 1 wallet and buy the audience followers
362577,psyop fake volume
362578,may be idk just that if 1nft per 1wallet fee should be very expensive
362580,every ok collection has the same stats in first couple days or prepost reveal these are simply daily stats while major collections often even trade otc like punks on their own things so nothing too out of the ordinary and can be anything of what u mentioned this is not too unusual
362584,they should first fix aml in tradfi
362585,alex3pg would also agree imho it was just an anonnew acc fud really
362590,hyperbole perhaps duh even but this crypto stuff going down this path is going to make the current system look almost utopian in hindsight lol
362591,but at least we will finally have mass adoption
362594,people are constantly under surveillance theyre conditioned to be consumers and will see having someone to complain to as a positive
362595,heh you think they care about being surveilled and you call me delusional
362597,we have people here unironically ask why you care about privacy and use things like tornado if you have nothing to hide theres nothing wrong and those are the crypto natives john doe using twitter for cat pictures couldnt care less
362605,nan
362607,sers blz less philosophy
362609,anyone know who is behind this project it may be a scam i have a friend trying to get in contact
362610,suspicious only chief of scam listing following

362627,the zencash rebrand
362628,oh is that what it is all i can deduce from their website is that its pow and they use zk
362629,does anyone on have links to a thread for the technical explanation behind the rising arbitrum gas costs
362630,yeah thats the one its a level 3 fork of zcash that was part of the blockchains that got 51d back when crypto51app released
362631,cool thanks i guess it goes into the not worth researching bucket
362632,tldr proposed solutions stop bnt rewards v3 was a mistake death spiral if unpaused ilp aim to fix the ilp model by organic fee revenue seems as though they are offering a chance to make a proposal for being compensated if you or a loved one was affected by the ilp pausing

362663,yeah people owning their money is risky business on market developments and emerging mltf threats the report highlights the continued need for the fatf to monitor the growth of and illicit financing risks associated with unhosted wallets
362664,the incentives for grayscale to allow this are not there allowing redemptions at the moment would empty out the fund theyre pretty comfy collecting 2 until conversion into spot etf where the lower fees would be offsetted by higher aum

362679,that was easily the most savage tweet ive seen today
362680,this clip will go down in history has anyone minted it as an nft yetthe bit where she cant get a word in edge ways as he has his tourettes episode is class
362681,is the guy just acting all the time
362682,think that whoever is from the outside this guy and bitboy are the first thing they see
362683,blockfi ceo saying its all noise
362684,i think ftx strike price is 25m for equity fwiw
362685,there is still competing bid from morgan creek
362686,teh problem is that they will lose the ftx credit facility which i think they already drew down on so its not just an equity funding round but also a 250m debt paydown given their offer would violate the covenants of the loan
362687,nan
362688,what could the covenants of the loan be
362689,loool this is the bit im talking about acting dunno but super hyper drugs just being a hype train to drive engagement ive no idea i dont dislike him but jfc this is funny af
362690,he was just excited idk
362691,dont turn this into pleb wars
362692,nan
362693,well pretty sure selling the entire equity for 99 to someone else probably is one of them seriously though vast majority of these contracts have change of control clauses that would get triggered

362711,lmao gg
362712,thanks cia
362713,what are some of the reasons why some teams decide to make their protocol token upgradeablefor example most defi tokens are not upgradeable like uni mkr eul comp but a few of them are like note snx steth or aave what could the main drivers be behind such decision leave some room for introducing new governance parameters maybe the oldest one were deployed at a time when proxies were not very popular obviously with a proxy you can change the tokens implementation and rug although that is unlikely to happen in the projects mentioned above but curious to know the point of view of some of the founders and investors in this group
362714,has anybody built a method to bulk importexport of accounts to metamask
362715,followup question is anybody aware of a web3 software wallet such as metamask rabby tally frame etc that has a bulk importexport functionality
362716,who are the top gaming people at defiance and delphi
362717,bancor used a proxy upgrade to stop ilp when the protocol was in danger to stop withdrawals then to start them again so it seems like upgrades and emergency actions regardless of how unpopular they may be are two examples
362718,that was at the protocol level their token is not upgradeable most protocols have upgradeable contracts for such purposes but i am curious about the tokens themselves
362719,that would be strange the only reason i can see to make a token upgradeable is to be able to change properties after issue not something id like
362720,hmm gaspriceio bugged
362721,interesting hes still writingthey just dismantled the hub a lot of smart people moving out or laid off would love to hear what his thoughts are on whats next thanks for sharing

362730,also noticed and thought like lmao is it a skynet
362731,reasons are fixing bugs adding new features particularly if new eips standards emerge recovery from hacks or other kinds of disasters giving gov full power over token complying to future regulation if it happens
362732,attention please attack on 0xpolygon is ongoing right nowusers see an rpc error asking users to urgently reset their seed on polygonappnet looks like this is wether dns hijack or a form of a supply chain attackjust a scam popup to bring you to a page to put your seednew attack vector discovered server certificate subject cnpolygonrpccom start date jul 1 073910 2022 gmt expire date sep 29 073909 2022 gmt subjectaltname host polygonrpccom matched certs polygonrpccom issuer cus olets encrypt cnr3very suspicious certificate issued today by letsencryptthats a polygon rpc related issue hijack please do not go to this website and do not enter your seed there be smarter then hackers you see someones insists on urgency think twiceuse your own rpcs you can get one for free with poktnetwork or alchemyplatform literally the same attack is ongoing now on fantomrpcftmtools is having issues at the moment and should not be usedif youre using that rpc please change it to the following rpcankrcomfantomit resolves to the same ip so this is the same hackers actions answer sectionrpcftmtools 78316 in a 186217114stay safe fam blockchain security privacy
362733,fantom as well same hacker
362734,thanks god substrate connect solves the issue hope it will work for evmcompatible chains as well they have a light node directly in the browser extension so that you can connect directly to the blockchain nodes
362735,its not limited to polygon
362736,nan
362737,already added info about fantom etc
362738,lazarus group again
362739,ah i see it now
362740,look harmony rpc
362741,ghostchain dead
362742,we provide public api for polygon as well
362743,sushiswaps mev protection does it use flashbots or something else
362746,
362747,affected rpcs are also provided by ankr so id maybe refrain from using their apis for now
362749,anyone else remember
362750,sambacha
362751,i believe they use manifold
362752,do any wallets use multiple rpc endpoints i think vitalik alluded to projects like this when he responded to moxies web3 critique
362753,most of them have fall backs of the primary one isnt available
362754,i dont think there is a switch though the logic is to try the primary first if you receive an error code then fall back
362755,block wallet afaik
362756,from math standpoint this looks ok get constant product value and use chainlink oracles to calculate price of lps but better check their peroformance if the liquidations work as intended without extra loss for the protocol keep us posted with your research results
362757,actually think the stuff ohm built is going to turn out as the key battle tested system for valuing lps
362758,can someone confirm
362760,interesting that neither the polygon or fantom rpc domains have dnssec records set
362761,reading up on lossless and the horizen bridge hack trying to wrap my head around how that works am i right in saying its basically an erc20 token with admin controls operated by some multisigdecision board i am sure this violates some crypto ethics wonder how people feel about it
362762,you are right
362763,about how it works or about violating crypto ethics
362764,is europe trying to kill stablecoins with their 200m limit to destroy a stable youd just need to do a 200m transaction right after midnight and nobody will be able to transact with it wtf
362766,source for those who havent seen it
362767,at this rate we need sbf to buy europe and fix that shit
362769,ftx previously europe
362770,you call vitalik to use his masterkey to pause the blockchain
362772,no more transactions for you time to go to bed
362773,im going back to my third world country at this rate were legalizing crypto soon
362776,wondering if it takes into consideration wrapped stables like if i trade 200m dai on polygon will i ruin it for everybody else on otjer chains
362777,
362779,its always just after midnight somewhere also usdt has 125b in transactions per day currently
362780,safe and protected regulations they said
362783,
362784,maybe cardono has a future
362785,im pretty sure this only targets stables like fei dai uxd etc
362786,does rai even fall into their law
362787,flashloan 1b in stablesethereum customer service transaction reverted daily 200m limit exceeded
362788,agreed if you were going to do this you could just extend your erc20 contracts to do this i know some deadly erc20 tokens that have the permission to freeze and remove funds and im not taking about tether or circle
362791,as i understand it this law is about digital assets but not cryptocurrencies in general so it may be not only tokens or even not tokens but synthetic assets or oldschool structured notes issued digitally
362793,the difference is that you give the rights to another board instead of keeping it with the protocol though
362794,anyone created a legal international entity before and care to share their steps
362795,i think both cases are pretty wild tbh
362796,nan
362798,your favourite dev giving up after a day and telling insidoors to sell as he not reviving it they rekt it though lmfao who is theyflork is officially dead but dont worry he will keep the dev marketing wallets of 160 bnb and the 73 bnb in liquidity wallets tracked below

362800,kucoin hack
362801,100 what an idiot
362802,i mean its not really a feature if you just ditch your token and start a new one with the same balances
362803,seems to me thats always an option if you are centralized enough
362804,same token but with the hackers address yanked out
362805,ehh yeah of course
362806,different from swapping to a new token which is indeed always an option
362807,hey ser lefterisjp do you plan to participate on optimism first gov vote p
362808,asking for a fren
362809,whats in there
362810,
362811,its the first round of distribution for the governance fund proposals
362812,fck if u re participant of 34 daos its an actually fulltime job to readunderstanddiscuss the proposal and vote what is the personal dao engagement limits for lobs boys
362813,too many polls the majority of delegatees wont care
362814,nan
362815,why not multiple choice vote
362816,between the page and metatx relay ill assume is mitm   
362817,this is just a popup in this case so if you dont read it and change rpc or do not go to this page to share your seed phrase yourself you are fine just dont share your seed dont type it on the website from the screenshotbut it also gives the attacker information which could be used to link your accountssee derphoprnetorgmy detailed review tmeofficer_cia334 see full post
362818,twittercommudit__guptastatus1542868192892256264polygon rpc is fine fantom healing too i guess now attack should be over
362819,so thats a reason twittercommudit__guptastatus1542858389964828672
362820,you wanna know why they call it fantom
362821,because all the money i invested in it went ghost
362822,100 thats why committing to being a delegate is important
362823,because all of those were the ones included so basically each one needs a decision aka they were already filtered out
362825,memes in kingdom
362828,does anyone know if botting arb sniping bots become obsolete after the eth merge is done
362829,yes i have already voted in some and commented in many
362830,hes very active in governance channel
362831,yes ser im not trying to push but rather understand if he was already done with the votes and was abstaining from the rest
362833,
362834,wait the scammer is still around
362835,the only people left in wonderland and popsicle basically just shitpost about dani and sifu all day cultish vibes
362836,yep seems like the zach thread was the greatest thing that ever happened to him
362837,hes writing an ebook too
362838,dont forget the mention in the netflix series
362839,i think if everyone would stop giving him attention hed go away but its like anything he does on chain gets reported by peck shield
362840,even then investing 25 million in a project with 42 million is more than brazen
362841,ignite ceo exits company following jae kwons return to tendermint
362842,is it just my selective memory repressing events or is this bear market a lot more absurd than the last one
362844,
362845,maybe someone knows how to open a flash drive on windows that was encrypted on macos
362846,the most noteworthy absurdity i remember from back then was people jumping from bitconnect to regalcoin to insert successive ponzis instead of learning their lesson so yeah definitely quite a bit more absurd this time
362847,defi has democratized ponzi
362848,at least bitconnect pretended to have a function all these dogcat memecoins arent even trying thats the real absurdity
362849,good to take a look to new modular concept for l1sl2sgavin woods involved
362850,lol indeed useless ethereum token uet was way ahead of its time lol
362851,landing page looks like useless vc cash grab lol worth to study
362854,yes the web doesnt say much they have also a medium
362855,just seems like another chain using substrate whats special
362856,yeah ser everyone who want will able to find their blogtgforum and etcno reason to post 10 times thanks
362857,why do we need another scaling solution when all these l1s barely have anything running on them
362858,maybe not now but maybe in the future could be a good solution to have modular possibilities for build l2 ad hoc easily disposable in order to have an elastic capacity this could help to scale but surely we should be able to read more about it for now they have only published the concept
362859,i dont care much for whatever that is but better to have and not need than to need and not have the second case is what we have today where people end up excusing and promising a labyrinth of hypothetical solutions that may have no practical reality
362860,nan
362861,not specifically crypto per se but this ought to be a bonus highlighti think we now understand better how little we understand about inflation
362862,anyone get a screenshot of the burry tweet deleted in the last 30 mins

362883,something about binance speaking to 50 companies needing bailouts
362884,busd is a fiatcoin 1 more in bank cz printing 1 busd
362885,fiat because its backed by usd or fiat because cz prints on demand
362886,not cz but paxos actually
362887,hey guys how does one calculate the il on curve pools ive seen tools for univ3 balancer and others so was wondering if they can be used for curve or it has a different mechanism
362888,
362889,whats the rumors about kucoin being insolvent is there any substance to that theres a lot of talk about it on ct
362890,in lawyerspeak its allegedly backed 11 by usd and usd equivalents
362891,as far as i know they print many fake tokens on low marketcap
362892,in fact sometimes you can see order books with like 500k tokens when they got only 100k on their wallet
362893,and once it goes to 0 they close the withdraws until someone deposits
362894,idk how is that possible actually
362895,thats all speculation plus thats not a reason to go insolvent
362896,thats just a way to make a lot of money
362897,after that idk how they can be insolvent their fees are high and they do a lot of volume
362898,
362899,loved the writing style
362900,we have learned this past month that doing something stupid is not the exclusive domain of plebs
362901,leave fees as lunaust all in the rest on anchor makes for a nice disaster recipe given they marketed it a lot in their channel
362906,what is gonna happen with this lol they will ban mayor stables
362907,
362908,what is this all about
362909,should be an encrypted message
362910,presumably precommitting hash of message hell reveal later
362911,ye cobie did smth like that a while ago
362912,an i told you so without actually telling anyone so
362913,thats how they should do those predict the lottery magic tricks
362914,my first thought was i am satoshi as he moves 1m coins
362917,
362918,nan
362919,its really common in the security world for vulnsexploits a hash of the proof of concept
362920,so could be that
362922,nan
362925,
362928,
362930,
362933,hey guysi am just learning different tricks and aspects of solidity by looking at different contracts of big projectsand i got interested in swap protocols and stuff like thatas far as i understand a few of the biggest swap apps like uniswap pancakeswap and etc use a factory contract setup where using a single function inside the main contract you can create liquidity pool contracts for new pairs that are added to the appso i was interested how can you get the liquidity pool info using a pair ethusdt for example from the uniswap contract for example
362934,factory contract has a getpairfunction to get the pool for tokena and tokenb
362935,then you get pool info with getreserves and such
362936,i think i probably missed that when looking through he code thanks for letting me know btw is that how it will be in most contracts like that
362937,if uniswaps fork then yes it will be diffirent with other amm like balancer
362938,most amm factories are forked from uniswap afaik
362939,balancer is not though
362940,lol most uniswap forks innovate by changing the name of the factory function to forknamev2factory
362941,
362950,forks that replace eth with the native token symbol in the router function names annoy me cuz i end up having to fix the function name in the abi
362951,
362952,wait wuuut
362956,interesting can you share examples
362957,will need to rewatch the walk through to understand why they had to use tick spacing
362962,admin why my post got deleted
362963,please explain
362964,lol
362965,lmaoo
362966,whats this btw
362967,the post is about new dex aggregation algorithm
362969,thanks
362970,no thats innacurate curve team found fees that hadnt processed and distributed 4m of them so this weeks admin fees are 50 this means cvxcrv apr is was insane
362971,our devs found a way to improve further uniswap v2v3 multihop feature and 1inch aggregation mechanism
362974,i think it might be interesting for the lobsterdao community yes
362975,i like that you capitalised devs its bout time that got they recognition they deserve
362976,you may share please but be prepared for anton to jump in and rekt u
362993,why 2 parts of the route trade negative amounts
362994,double negative makes a positive
362995,seems like it can fill an order of 163 eth
362996,wouldnt that equal 1 eth
362997,even more
362998,is this really on chain or is it a simulation of what you hope to build
362999,its a ui bug its mean to be 11063
363000,oh ok just making sure u are crossing your is and dotting your ts
363001,yours is a thankless job ser
363002,its onchain
363005,actually geniusflash loan ethsell more eth via paths with gud selling pricebuy eth via paths with bad selling pricerepay flash loanprofit
363006,seriously speaking most likely scenario is that they casually forgot to put a restriction of amount0 when searching for the best execution path thus the price is better its literally swap arb in one go
363009,i think so too also they might have forgotten about dex balances thats why 1e105 eth swap possibleand probably gas isnt counted looking at 10 eth to usdc trade example they split transaction in 3 while winning 3 to uniswap
363010,no everything is in order
363011,its just math
363012,ok but which math allows trading negative amount of eth to negative amount of btc
363014,did you enter a negative amount
363015,dont do it its just an mvp
363016,no it swapped for negative amount through transactionanyways lets see how it turns out wish you good luck with the project building is good regardless
363021,defi_dreamer sorry but asking devs and degens to watch a trailer video when being asked routing qs is not cool appreciate u and muted not cool to engagement farm like dat cheers
363024,trust me its just math
363025,but it doesnt make sense
363026,math
363031,
363032,ive found su
363052,
363053,who was it wtf
363054,we can move along when you unmute aziza she did not do anything wrong
363055,you can move along so will we cheers muted
363056,no beef again all the best to u but stop spamming here
363057,keeping this here for transparency and history and removing the messages which flooded the chat
363059,fuck napgender
363061,does anyone know of bridge hack or any other hack which happened dues to upgradable proxies will be really helpful
363062,if thats all they have then it will do little if anything at all
363065,well you are assuming people will start caring about whatever that project is because of that
363067,wait so the fees on kyber is lower than in uni than lp would get more rektif part of them is also paid to token holders lps even more rekt
363068,hah been a while since i heard someone say that name
363071,pays out revenue to holders unlike unithis line of reasoning reminds me of kucoin in 2017 when they were trying to make a name for themselves under binances shadow
363072,wasnt fees from jit like a small fraction of all lps reward though
363074,file into another one like bancor that for whatever reason wasnt lucky enough to be particularly relevant
363077,slightly ye true dat
363080,hypothetically assuming it doesnt become any more significantly relevant after this what will be your conclusion
363082,accurate clout is a thing
363084,please ctrlf for stable discussions
363085,dont try to find an easy answer
363087,
363088,12 seems interesting
363089,isnt that an anime platypus not a penguin edit asking the real important questions as usual
363090,the looks rare team its anon right i wonder how they implement revenues shares and not having any legal issue
363091,prob not anon to wherever they founded the company just to us
363093,revenue sharing token tho
363095,nan
363096,etherscan down
363097,yes
363099,its working now
363100,some now reference
363101,whats the consequence
363102,consequence of
363103,in the above case their wallet was depleted
363105,
363106,will discuss this in kingdom since we dont chat about trading and gambling in this main research chat
363109,did hardhat add an automine feature seems like i can run my tests without spining up a hardhat node
363110,
363111,ah thats not the definition of autonmine in the traditional sense it means the test chain mints a block when its received
363112,y does it spin up a node automaticly
363113,i havent checked but was writing some tests recently and by habit started a node in another terminal
363114,just for tests without state persistence yes no need for local node
363115,just tried again and you dont have to run the node
363116,so weird
363117,and convenient
363118,prob 2 im trying to deploy a contract onto rinkbey using framesh and im getting this weird error providererror transaction parameter to is not a valid hex stringframe is saying request already declined
363119,runs ok with other networks we had an issue with one of ropsten rpcs after the merge maybe your provider having same issues
363120,great point same error on gorli too
363121,any chance anyone found opyn crabstrategy v2 contracts on the test nets they didnt publish officially but thought mb someone came across
363122,dm me with the transactions you are running maybe i can help
363127,ugh i got a really bad vibe reading messaris email titled it looks like opensea is keeping the throne shouldnt we be evaluating protocols agnostically feels like a puff piece for os
363128,there is no unbiased mediaresearch or vcits a reality and we have to accept thateven lobsters are mostly eth maxis
363129,idk if arguing on a harmless title makes sense here they probably wanted a hit piece title totally fair as media where usually looksrare comes right after opensea idk weird convo fin also alex is right ye
363130,long live puns
363131,is wrapped doge available on ethereum i cant find anything
363132,
363133,i cant dm you
363134,monkeyontheloose managed ill send you a dm
363135,only 137 holders on eth
363136,is there any opensource code or api that can provide an updated list of addresses and their primary ens i dont want to use an web3 library would prefer if it was an https endpoint
363137,this is scam
363138,scammer asking for money
363139,am asking for moneyam not scamming
363141,damn so there is no wrapped doge on eth
363142,i just need am a newbie in the space
363143,rendoge
363146,nice probably better then
363147,ok do you have link to it i am looking for a coin that i can buy on eth and bridge it to doge rendoge might be best option
363148,am i witnessing someone coming to lobsterdao for advice on how to buy doge
363151,no man question might sound dumb but im not
363152,enough doge discussions for today fin srymoderation on
363153,kind of want to know what his plan is now
363156,you can mint doge on most chains through renbridge
363157,so there is nothing like official wdoge like we have wbtc wbnb on ethereum
363158,you think my few question on doge which you considering as shilling can move a 3040b project
363159,the anti crypto conference
363160,stealing buttcoins thunder reeee
363161,
363162,that data is now leaked cz also tweeted about it just now
363163,ooof
363165,wbtc isnt official either you could use renbtc as well
363166,renbtc is much safer
363167,
363168,
363169,not sure if appropriate feel free to delete
363170,who knows maybe this has implications on what products theyll launch chances are slim but got me thinking
363171,this is really sad
363172,how founderled is binance vs bus being more autonomous
363173,and yet completely par for the course in this space
363174,yep im currently dealing with much of the same in the last few days ive had people threatening to rape me wishing me dead and i have a feeling the dox attempts are about to begin since they are now complaining about me being anon some of this started before launch too
363175,wtaf
363176,jesus christ
363177,the worst part is how they pretend to be civil in public by stirring the pot but manage to drag other users missing context into the dog pile what sucks is that i am trying my best to be a better person but its definitely becoming more and more difficult
363178,welcome to crypto fuck anyone who expects people to go public before expecting the community to be reasonable first
363179,not surprised in the least bit lol
363180,i mean and this is meant as no defence for any of the disgusting maggots treating you or anyone that way but this space has been this toxic since 2017
363181,i know unfortunately its one thing when you get a couple randos from the peanutgallery for existing its another when its a group actively trying to mess with your livelihood
363182,sorry youre going through this plenty folks love to grift in the space when they dont reach the profit or fame that they expect from exploiting others filter the noise
363183,problem is normies in crypto want the upside of being early in risky investments without any of the downside for them each project has to give them a huge return or else its a scam
363184,i am entitled to riskfree profit making and you should feel bad for denying me that also youre not allowed to profit only comlunitee is
363185,only up or else team is scam
363186,super cycle guyz
363188,it goes both ways theres also projects who want to easily raise money from retail but expect them not to act like retail if you raise money from a bunch of random people you will get the full spectrum of emotional responses
363189,you can argue that people shouldnt behave in certain ways and i fully agree but people will always be like this
363190,i do not understand the constant surprised reaction around something thats been known for ages the internet is an easy place to be toxic and money brings out the worst in people
363191,sure not saying its fully the fault of retail either its just incompatiblilty in general retail outside of crypto only hears about a project after it has survived its initial days where its a reasonable expectation that it will be successful bringing same expectation to crypto is unrealistic
363192,you can argue that regulators have a different agenda than they claim but theres some truth to the idea that the average person isnt able to make an informed rational decision when it comes to investments its either that or the kind of stuff were discussing here wouldnt happen i know very unpopular take but you cant have it both ways
363193,nobody is surprised and im not sure where you think anyone actually is people can vent at being on the receiving end of toxic behaviour sometimes a bit of empathy and a simple damn that sux is enough
363194,this would be noteworthy if this behavior was peculiar to projects that raised money from randoms on the internet it isnt
363195,another thing is lack of domain knowledge expecting a aaa game within an year or two of starting development is just lack of awareness retail has no idea on what early development of any product looks like and hence piles up unrealistic demand on teams to deliver something so price can pump
363197,sorry didnt mean to address you more the projects that raise during bull and then suddenly close down when stuff gets too toxic
363198,whether you collected money or not from socalled retail the entitlement is the same
363199,probably because they are not expecting users to try and cross over and mess with them in real life for only getting a 2 3x and not the 100x they imagined
363200,id like to think that a16z doesnt send rape threats to their portfolio companies theres a difference
363201,theyre not the ones with the entitled crying in tg either so its a moot point to bring them up
363202,consider the fact that that screenshot is essentially a paraphrase of andres comment and he didnt raise money from anyone community is bullshit so my theory was as follows if someone has the token it is in their best interest to do whatever they can to increase the value of their token how naive i was and i guess this is partly our own fault as a defi community for calling it governance tokens because all people want to do is govern but not in the trenches helping fight instead on their throne as a dictator simply shouting orders while their plebian developers need to execute they dont care about your protocol they dont care about you and would just as soon sell that token when they no longer think you are contributing enough by their standards not them you they wont try to add value but they will be happy spending endless hours of your time asking you for updates and for you to explain in detail your thought processes and endless back and forth on the most pointless menial topics governance and community kill innovation and development dont do it
363203,but thats my point you dont get this issue if you dont raise directly or indirectly from retail its emotional responses from people who clearly were not fit to make an investment decision
363204,again youre wrong
363205,this is preaching to the choir tbh most project communities are mostly filled with degens who are on moon or dust mission or people who think investing in any crypto is essentially a sureshot lottery
363206,whether or not you raise money from retail the outcome is virtually identical
363207,i consider what andre did also raising money from retail in this context it doesnt matter whether you do it intially or let them join later as exit liquidity
363208,thats a dubious redefinition of terms then
363209,20 risk free apy im in
363210,so is zhu
363211,honestly retail as a term doesnt make sense it should be clueless investor
363212,he didnt raise money from them any more than satoshi raised money from randoms who willingly bought btc and chose to run nodes if the floor for raising money is i bought a token of a dex thinking id get rich then the conversation is absurd
363213,i wish i could say youre right but unfortunately its not the case people will claw faces for a tiny bit of power and once they feel comfortable enough will consistently bite at your heels money just unfortunately amplifies the problem
363214,oh its a euphemism for that and more 100
363215,community are your users as well as your token holders and to some extent the funders of these experimental innovative products a balance between community and devs is needed bad behaviour exists on both sides of the spectrum
363216,i dont really want to dive into the andre situation but hes no satoshi and made quite a bit of money even while constantly larping about the opposite
363217,there is a chasm between user and token holder
363218,community and devs can be just as entitled if you wana build with no distractions accountability justified or not dont take public money
363219,im not claiming hes satoshi
363220,not necessarily
363221,i mean satoshi made a lot of money too just because he doesnt sell doesnt mean he aint rich
363222,the idea that him making money or not takes away from anything is a funny case in point
363223,the basic point is that if you create expectations for any kind of profit potential and let everyone participate in the opportunity youre going to deal with this stuff if you cant handle that keep it private
363224,this is a strawman ser
363225,you want to claim even 50 of token holders for a dapp are users
363226,i mean you can make the same argument for the other side if you cant handle the risk and volatility of early stage projects then you shouldnt buy it
363227,no the reason people launch tokens is because they want to make money theres always upside for the creator and if you intend to take that money from the general public you have to deal with them
363228,yes fully agree
363229,its almost as if both sides are just people and they all act in predictable ways
363230,its friction between misplaced expectations
363231,without accurate data we cant claim that or otherwise what i am claiming is token holders usually have a vested interest in also being users of a dapp being a user can also translate into buying into the vision of the dapp project
363232,yeah retail shouldnt expect to get rich and devs shouldnt expect retail to behave in an informed and rational way very simply put
363233,why are you arguing with strawmen
363234,bull tokens go up tokens are goodbear tokens go down tokens are bad why do any of these things even need a token anyways
363235,first you define raising money from retail as an absurd i bought a token off a dex and expect to get rich now youre attacking something nobody is arguing about
363236,i clarified what i meant get over it
363237,its meaningless but okay
363238,safe to conclude wen numbah go down devs are dicks and community are entitled dicks numbah go up devs are heros and community are geniuses
363239,this is strange what would count as sufficient data for you
363240,save for network tokens where almost everyone is a user by virtue of needing to pay gas fees are you claiming theres any dapp where mere token holders dont outnumber users at least 51
363241,but then again if you expect crypto to be different from traditional finance gatekeeping who can or can not invest in a project doesnt match that expectation instead expecting people to take responsibility for what they are buying into is more reasonable imo instead of telling devs to only use private funding
363242,expecting people to not behave like they have for centuries is always more unreasonable crypto isnt magically going to fix greed gambling
363243,no not claiming anything also not trying to get into an argument just highlighting that its a rational assumption that token holders are also users and a lot of smart teams know exactly how to utilise tokens to bootstrap a user base
363244,i mean i worked at a bank once upon a time beyond irate customers and sometimes shitty behaviours i dont ever recall being on the receiving end of the same level of nonsense not to say it didnt happen just nowhere near to this level that it happens in crypto so im not sure that argument has any weight people have demonstrated they are more than capable of controlling themselves its weird that for whatever reason it seems to get a pass in crypto like haha thats crypto
363245,this is a really valid point imo however harsh reality is raising public money will always come with public accountability positive and negative
363246,less anonymity less risk probably makes the difference there
363247,nobody is arguing token holders cant get or expect to get rich not sure why you insinuate anyone isthe only people arguing anyone shouldnt get rich are coincidentally the same retail your own comment on the matter being noteworthy
363248,yes so its safe to say that expecting people to change is unreasonable is not accurate were not expecting people to change theres an expectation that people behave civily as they already do in their day to day lives
363249,people are generally dicks on the internet where the risk of being punched in the face is non existent
363250,then why even have a decentralized financial system instead of what has already been working for centuries my point is not that people need to manage their greed and gambling my point is if you are entering a new system its a reasonable expectation to make yourself acquainted with the new rules instead of expecting everything to be the same ultimately i dont want my greed and gambling to be restricted because others dont know how to manage theirs
363251,um ahem maybe this is the curse of experience but i cannot agree that its rational i cannot think of a single project where that is true not one
363252,tbh i have no idea what your point is all im saying is that projects who first let in retail and then close down because of muh toxicity failed to do due diligence on what they were about to get into or are using it as an excuse to exit this isnt a problem first since 2022
363253,it doesnt even make sense in the face of this
363257,uh just to be clear thats wrt to users vs mere token holders
363258,bear market digest
363259,yes they were naive 3 weeks ago i brought this up and people saidinsinuated i was wrong about it you included and here we are fwiw yes you probably misunderstand whats being talked about
363260,a man would literally come up w new definitions than go to therapy
363261,this chart feels arbitrary classification of layers
363262,yeah the terminology is inconsistent with much of the existing discourse
363263,lol cardano a layer 0 what was the basis for this chart seems skewed in a a bunch of different areas all the layer 23 are specific to eth
363264,youre certainly welcome to do a taxonomy or hierarchy for blockchain stacks but it would be helpful to avoid conflicting with existing usage
363265,that was a different discussion about how to deal with toxic community members i wasnt denying their existence
363266,eg layer 0 as community consensis and layer 3 as rollups on rollups
363267,well layer 3 is more of a starkware invention than industry wide term i guess
363268,eh insinuating such toxicity which is almost exclusively tethered to price is due to not being able to build a worthwhile community is questionable
363269,ill say what ive said the other times consider not coddling retail and treating them as adult babies entitled to riskfree profitdevs being naive enough to think talk of community will save them from such toxicity is naive like youve said but unless the first happens such naivety will remain
363270,lets cut it here i feel bad for spamming the room with another iteration on this dont think we disagree too much or have new things to say
363271,lets talk about happy things
363272,lets go to sleep
363273,aalex p
363274,related important note this is just a mind experiment dont take everything as 100 truth make your own decision
363275,not unapropriate but simply stupid
363276,any central location to view token unlock schedules
363277,why stupid
363278,mans out here tryna reinvent anthropic reasoning from first principlesphilosophy grad students in the know are sweating
363279,to say that is alleviating to know that we live in a simulation because it reduces the pressure i mean isnt this completely devoid of reason
363280,its a childish aproach to the question of what is real
363281,philosophers will weep blood reading this
363282,i did
363283,set up for metaverse innit
363284,yea makes sense now that you said it
363285,
363286,this theory is quite destructive and i would advise not to take for granted everything written in that article as well as similar statements from elon musk or anyone else
363287,thats dope
363288,nothing is granted never
363290,gm folks is there anyone aware of how a perp dex margin calls its clients
363291,before their wallets assets go out for auctions
363292,they dont just liquidate
363293,usually mine just goes poof
363294,gm everyone does anyone know how does mintablesclub gasless minting works under the hood
363295,i think it should be metatransaction their relayer like opensea doesuser only need to sign the transaction
363299,
363301,has anyone seen terras pitch deck and can share it tia
363302,suspending withdrawals shouldnt even be a thing
363305,the problem was the way you wrote your question people werent sure if you exported your trezors underlying seed phrase somehow as long you dont do that you will be fine barring some more exotic attack vectors
363306,hey all heres a list of seed investments from paradigm this year one of the leading web3 vcs
363307,anyone has some general cryptodefi noob guidesdocumentation in spanish
363308,
363309,wait if they have no exposure to any of the blowups why are they halting
363310,it could be that fixed duration loans are not coming in yet compared to liquid withdrawals
363311,yeah my guess is that only
363312,like somtimes compound aave gearbox etc might not have the if all is utilized
363313,doesnt mean insolvency in any way tho and ye it means higher apy for lps then
363314,yup that makes sense but only if something like this was written in the blog as well lol
363315,
363316,for anyone asking for hystorical balances of an address
363317,the pratice of metamask that you have to create a new walletenter a seedpharse to connect your hardware wallet is anyway shitthe approach like rabby is using where you can directly connect is far better
363318,how ironic
363319,can any legend share some resources detailing or highlight some projects working on unified andor privacy respecting standards for sbts read the rmk stuff sismo thanks to whever shared interested in recent development of composable reputation modules
363320,youtube crypto influencers are 21st century snake oil salesmenit has to be said an overwhelming amount of crypto influencers are no better than used car salesmen or snake oil salesmen their enthusiasm during bull runs is almost never curbed by the principles of sound investing practices guys like james fro
363321,can you tell me why polygons rpc is much more stuck compared to several other public chains rpc
363322,how much more are we talking
363323,what makes matics rpc harder to use than other chains rpc
363324,please get a dedicated one
363325,yeah was trying to make some tx on opensea and it keeps failing on matic
363326,is there a protocol in which you can choose to deposit some of your funds into yield generating defi protocols like makerdao or compound and then choose to pledge a part of that yield to a third party as a way of giving grants or for an organization to raise funds
363327,something like angel protocol
363328,heard of smth like that before not angel but cant remember the name
363332,
363333,something similar i guess
363334,thanks that looks like what i had in mind
363335,not your rpc not your coins
363336,does anyone know a web3 analog for mirocom
363337,charmverseio
363338,or skiff
363339,people in web3 dont do much work so we dont need productivity tools
363341,those are notion analogs not so good for brainstorming and building mind maps
363342,much needed for daos
363343,why do you need a web3 analog
363344,miro analog is basically the last major collaborative tool that doesnt exist in web3 mb some teams already working on smth like that
363345,figma has a similar tool
363346,is the main advantage web3 login
363347,to integrate into a dao workflow
363348,web3 login identity linking instant rewardspayment poapsnfts possibly there are many points that are being improved especially if your project is in web3 or for web3
363349,
363350,
363351,i joke sr but yea charmverse is the best i found they are pretty approachable if u need something custom
363352,i feel for you i currently just experienced the same just two weeks ago i tried working with the mods but it seemed they made up their mind without giving the devs chance to explain it got really toxic for a bit however i chose to continue down the path thankfully we have some reasonable people in the community so we were able to flush out the bad actors and are slowly changing the sentiment of the community to one that is when moon to one that is based on building product dm if you want to chat how you carry yourself and respond will be important dont give into the trolls
363353,now do you agree
363354,two different topics but no i dont agree
363355,do you have examples of other web3 productivity tools like this
363356,huddle zoom
363357,also feel free to dm as the topic was put to a close last night
363358,and theres also otterspacexyz
363359,do i want to join zooms with my precious lobster nah fk that you can pay 100k just for preview no free zoom calls but it exists
363360,heres a good list of productivity tools
363361,hey guys if youre curious about eth2 staking stats i just updated my dune dashboard tracking just this happy to hear your feedback too
363362,ust depeg claims update100 individual claims were filled and 94 were paid out for a total of 5400 eth18 claims were challenged and sent to kleros_io out of which 12 claims were deemed valid by the jury 4 were rejected and 2 still disputed
363363,insurance in crypto as actually working i have seen wnxm has paid quite a lot recently in particular for rari
363364,quite a few on my compendium as well i see a few on messari i am missing so will add those in soon as well
363367,when they protect you so hard it overflows and puts you in danger
363368,but dont complain though thats not allowed
363370,dutch farmers together strong
363371,if you like a parade of millionaires doing road blocks
363372,for europoors mev searchers
363378,wow how bitter kek
363380,lmao
363381,tax payers pay for this
363383,not only europoors though bis is international so everyone might be impacted
363384,yea bis is big dont get me wrong
363389,how was the difference between hft and illegal activities in tradfi drawn some mev can be based on a course of signals then technically not illegal even put in tradfi case
363390,you may see it as bitter but i think every daofunded builder will agree in most cases we are building for absolute retards wenboiz of the most bottomofthebarrel persuasion and literally anything you do is not enough for at least 10 of them at all times the more i build in this space the more i am convinced the full anon route is the way to go just build no raises no dox no nothing if something is useful cool if not fuck off but no one to answer to no telegram no chats or discords nothing where non builders can talk to you
363391,i build for you guys nah you build cause you like it you also make good money from it so focus on the work with those who are positive driven and contribute and maybe dont fall for the noise sadness is hard but you gotta filter
363392,nay on the good money but yeah because i like it the problem with filtering is how you have tg and discord groups accessible to everyone and if you want to keep those opportunities rolling you never know when there is one behind the next dumbass asking for the next wen how filter sir
363393,read it accept it and decide adhoc if you wanna cry or move on
363394,sex alcohol gambling sports do some of that if you wanna zone out from the work
363395,or dont have any public channels dont take retail money and build to your hearts content
363396,thats not a dao then we were specifically talking of a dao public all pants open style
363397,kek my point exactly cant have openness without dealing with accountability entitlement positive or negative
363398,its hard at times have a support group of frens u can shitpost with ups and downs
363399,mostly downs aka me
363400,hence kingdom
363401,buy the fucking nft
363403,oef
363404,easier said than done as a builder things do get rough many different levels of fud some cut deep devs have impostor syndrome often best advice imo is either build alone and ignore everything like bruno said or dont build alone do not be the builder and manage a community at the same time
363405,not a coder but i find gardening a healthy alternative to building
363406,agreed in my spare time i am building a dictionary of the chechen language and also i like doing hydroponic set ups and growing things
363407,different kind of bug killing hehe
363409,its really fun and its a good way to break away from just being behind a screen or at least being away from people on the screen
363410,i love it that where you said regulation you mean the ccp surveillance state
363413,touche
363414,could you be more specific what you mean by illegal activities legality of action in the traditional finance world is very dependent on the countrys regulatory scheme in eu they have mifid ii which requires companies engaging in hft to store their trading data up to 5 years that way the regulators may decide to investigate if they think there have been any instances of market manipulation in the us regulation nms requires all trading data on exchanges off exchange venues like dark pools and crosses dont count be stored exchanges have surveillance units where they report to the sec possible instances of market manipulation
363415,who invested in teller that nft loan project
363416,i was asked to do kyc and then escrow my nfts for loan
363417,just want to check if this is indeed the case
363418,you also make good money from itis this true i rather vividly remember people losing their minds here when sushiwhatshisname dared to do that
363419,imho that was a specific case of a very distressed situation
363420,then i raise you andre
363421,thnx a lot of it not really web3 like notion obsidian roam and gitbook and im sure a bunch more but useful nonetheless
363422,i raise you csw
363423,also another case in general i dont think daos have issues with paying to contributors
363424,i would even say the opposite daos overpay and will continue to overpay
363425,true
363426,sers we need to hire someone just blz use the treasury we need smth to be built
363427,are we somehow suggesting that builders in the space are not making enough money or have problems to access capital
363428,if so compared to what
363429,compared to irl people are making goood money or maybe i am out of touch af
363430,me im saying bagholders love to cry about builders making money like it detracts from anything
363431,alas we have a seemingly evergreen example of that
363432,i was referring to the illegal by this tweet mentioned previously for europoors mev searchers
363433,is front running even illegal i thought only spoofing was illegal but frontrunning is fine
363434,frontrunning based on insider knowledge is illegal most of the time
363435,front running is illegal when acting on insider info this is again quite subjective if theres no evidence and often these are judged case by case and intent and magnitude of the damage done to the market is taken into considerstion
363436,oh yeah i was referring to hft based front running
363437,front running is illegal in 999 of cases
363438,which i guess is not insider info but still based on information asymmetry
363439,yeah i thought only spoofing illegal too
363440,ah but if you know a client is going to sell a big size then you sell in front this is insider info then illegal
363441,yeah it depends on whether the way you got the information is deemed fair basically
363442,unless they have publicly announced their position or youve predicted that a certain position will be taken
363443,or you have orderflow from robinhood
363444,no matter what the legal definitions are im purely talking about the us here the sec has a limited bandwidth and they have to choose which ones they go after these rules serve as deterrents for market participants to selfpolice themselves because you never know if the sec will be on your tail or notthis details the overall workflow of secs market surveillance unit which chooses which ones to go after out of omes that sros reported them referrals
363445,which basically means its rampant and will only be punished if someone gets absolutely caught in a public fashion
363446,or they push their luck because they know 9 times out of 10 nobody will fight them
363447,no it doesnt lets not jump to conclusionsin practice you have many firms especially execution shops and hfs try to do better selfpolicing to stay on the good side of the sec amd srosedit quick disclaimer 2nd paragraph is a statement based on personal observation given my network take it with a grain of salt
363448,sec and sros flag supicious activities if you push your luck they can choose to go and has the ability to do so after youreg nms allows sros and see every market activityhow sro model works read section iia how secs surveillwnce approwch has been changing and examples of cases they went after edit this initially served as a deterrent for people making unjustified criticisms of the tradfi world and its alleged injustices but now editted to include citations where it exists factual statements and acknowledgement of educated guesses
363449,heres a crazy idea how about they come up with a reverse accreditation test and ban everyone that fails the test from dabbling in cryptofirst question you will lose all your money are you okay with this
363450,ok this is getting too couch legal lets please go back to getting rekt fin
363451,is there any quantitative comparison between the amount of transactions processed by flashbots and eden network
363453,okeee thats totally fair i think i should edit the above and link citations where necessary add disclaimers saying the secs approach will change over timethere are some data points you can deduce the above from terms of reg nms data fields in sip and how market centers can keep firm level info info on secs financial crime department and their approach
363454,the real alpha about quantum theory proving that part of our reality is probabilistic was completly missedstep up the physics game cz
363455,step up your stable coin game
363456,throwing stones in his glass house ffs
363457,the double slit experiment says it all
363458,spoofing is illegal in tradfi frontrunning isnt illegal its very common
363459,nan
363460,yes frontrunning is common and the common frontrunning that we see remains illegal that being front running done upon covert information im not sure what sort of front running youre talking about tbh but ill leave it there since this convo is formally closed off at this point
363461,most frontrunning isnt off of covert information afaik its with publicly available information the mempool
363462,mostis there actually any mev at all in crypto that is not based off of public information
363463,bera market ration
363464,yes transaction reordering you dont know how much gas the other person is willing to pay and hence you dont know if his transaction will get picked or na
363465,hi guys are there other dexs besides curve that are trying to provide deep onchain liquidity for pegged value crypto assets only
363466,nothing as deep as curve you can try smaller tvl dexs like saddle finance thats basically a fork
363467,that doesnt sound right miners choosing to prioritize txs that pay more and as they see fit is how block building works or are you referring to something else
363468,thanks know about saddle but want to find another examples ill try to look for more forks
363469,yes and at the core thats how front running works
363470,solidly forks like velodrome on op use stableswap curve as well
363471,what if mevgeth miner receives an arb trade and decides to execute it themselves instead of including the original transaction
363472,uniswap v3 can be used for same
363473,actually not sure if mevgeth has any checks against that
363474,platypus on avax uses a diff oracle based approach
363475,also the solidly amm curve
363476,this is one id love to see some formal research on
363477,but the frontrunning youre describing is happening based off of public information
363478,but your transaction will be part of the public mempool which you can watch for and increase your gas theoretically if you are not using a private transaction service
363479,solidly was a good idea with poor execution having vecrv positions be liquid as fnfts is a positive thing weve been doing it on fantom with liquiddriver and spiritswap and you see an active secondary picking up steam allows anyone buying lqdr to increase their costbasis while the tokens are locked which means that they wont just get dumped once the xlqdr unlocks in a few years
363480,balancer isnt focused primarily on stable pools but it does have stablemath pools and some stetheth stable liquidity
363482,isnt balancer stablepool based on curves stableswap
363483,yea
363484,yes and no i agree that original front run happens through public info however once you and the other front runners bots catch the transaction you guys are essentially playing poker to guys who will bid the highest gas to get transaction through and that ser is up to the individual
363485,thats sounds like a different problem tangential to frontrunning though not to mention that intermittent period before the tx is confirmed allows you to use that public information to also frontrun the frontrunners if youre so inclined
363486,you are right
363487,did anyone use otocoio or similar platforms to spin up the legal stuff for your project
363489,heard from some podcast a while ago looks like cool solution but im curious how legit is it from the real legal aspect
363490,kalidao but im not sure if any court would honour it
363491,also very curious about how legally legit it is and how by forming an entity with them it may legally bind you in ways unknown in the changing legal environment
363492,definitely cool tho
363493,will check thanks
363494,huh interesting reminds me of njalla but for legal entities
363495,
363496,aw hecc this is pretty cool i wish i knew of this months ago
363497,weirdly i needed to read that today
363498,if shit hits the fan not sure if best idea to use also if same strawman used on all companies then you get rekt by relation
363499,
363500,looks cool too they have also announced the integration with opolis for health care need to check how does it really work tho
363504,
363505,has anyone got any suggestions to other upcoming token lauches groups or useful calendars
363506,good morning guys anyone here has any guide about deploying soulbound nfts please thanks in advance lobsters
363507,this is so niceits like in school h have to learn a short poem for each wallet
363508,i will make a poem and pretend its from a secret admirer
363509,if you send me your seed phrase ill make a poem and be your secret admirer
363510,can we just pretend instead _
363511,ok i will secretly admire you w no poem
363512,i accept
363513,nice so i just type in my seed phrase and hit send love the idea
363515,crypto lender coinloan lowers withdrawal limit citing market conditions
363516,no mev anymore
363517,im thinking about hacks exploits but you could argue its public information
363518,front running leaked rpc data
363519,what does that entail
363520,is this a burn
363521,were in blockchain fone szn
363522,we go again
363524,and on another note are there other online alternatives to snapshotorg for token voting
363531,
363532,how is it possible with the official dropbox domain dropbox doesnt download files automatically by default
363533,
363534,oh wow fuck they launched literally a couple weeks ago regulators sent a shitty email probably
363535,dont think so lol
363536,but they just had a great launch w ribbon well you ser
363537,nice start it seemed
363538,i think its just fickle dev more than reg
363539,interesting thought they worked on it for quite some time and didnt even see them launching a shitcoin to dump on noobs
363542,its just a bonus for nft lobster holders i understand as was the case with the ghouls
363543,this removed the link cause we dont do nft gambling in this chat anyway
363545,in tradfi to move into tbills u cant do it as retail treasury doesnt trade w plebs who are not billionaires so u have to do via certified blabla agencies who take a cut so a 3 u see is gonna be 2 at best really likely less idk ofc depends on ur net worth if u can negotiate fees
363546,anyone run get node if yes whats your major usecase
363548,you care about decentralisation you run a service and dont want to get rate limited by your provider low latency for stuff like mev you are a miner or validator
363549,also vibes
363550,also some calls like eth_getlogs are not available on a lot of providers as they are resource intensive if your use case requires this then you might have to run a node
363551,question all these lenders right will default do they pay back depositors in kind ie in eth btc etc or do they liquidate all to usd to pay back in usd
363552,also you are and you want to get a snapshot in time answer of what it costs to run a node
363553,such a silly report this requires 3 tb but i am going to run it with 750 mb just in case
363554,i think its still useful tbh you never really know how these requirementsrecommendations are made and sometimes things work even far under whats listed as a requirement
363555,fair
363556,i still think its done in bad faith
363557,and it was funny to read about icp
363558,if you know bitcoiners i wouldnt call it bad faith lopp starts with the baseline assumption that being able to run a node should be easy enough for anyone to do on basic consumer hardware something very common in those circles and the benchmarks at least as i see them are simply seeing what conforms
363559,i do seem to remember being puzzled by how he did eth though but id have to check again
363560,i feel like its kicking tires we know eth has massive storage requirements the instructions say so anyways found the bsc one interesting as at the time it completed with 20 something gb wonder what it is now
363561,worse performance requires higher hardware costs which prices more users out of being able to attain the sovereign security model enabled by running your own nodehis intent is pretty clear
363562,far more reasonable than 999999 of bitcoin maxi figureheads
363563,fair but i still think its m00t its like running a probabilistic model on the feasibility of transactions fees sustaining the bitcoin network when mining rewards end as least eth is trying to do something about it and acknowledges the problem
363564,well if you go through the article youll see he actually cares about that minimum viability to run a node
363565,it would be trivial but expensive to set your baseline arbitrarily high to fit even solana but well you answer a different question then
363566,any project which actually has this as a core value that anyone can participate without amassing hardware
363567,or where more power does not equate to more gains
363568,you may want to try the bitcoin whitepaper believe its also mentioned in ethereums
363569,remember that there is a difference between miningvalidating and simply being a node on the network too
363570,i wanted to write other than og btc values
363571,celo iirc i seem to remember was trying to make sure you could run a node on a phone
363572,are there any helium ogs here is anyone even using it or its just been running on token inflation since start
363573,celo has staking afaik so there still is some discrepancy there
363574,for validation bitcoin otherwise its an intractable problem to participate in consensus economies of scale always tend towards centralisation i did some work with start up wants to solve this ie one cpu on vote by using asymmetric aes encoding but research shows its probably pointless and in about 5 years someone would come up with an asic to defeat this
363575,maybe mina
363576,there is qortal that i know of
363577,and they are the only ones who have a solid model for equal participation in the network for everyone
363578,they have some solid tech built like fully onchain decentralized chat and a few other neat features
363579,again running a node is not the same as running a validator btc has a high bar to entry for mining but not for being a node
363580,whats the point of running a node then and werent they the same definition in the og btc whitepaper
363581,this seems pretty hand wavey lacks a clear description of how its consensus works
363582,its all in the wiki
363583,the tech is there it works they just dont focus as much on opticsmarketing
363584,they just buidl
363585,you can verify everything on the network and have access to all history and the mempool directly
363586,think of someone like alchemyinfura i doubt theyre mining but theyre running a lot of nodes
363587,assuming block rewards per block are fixed this still leads towards centralisation farms as eventually the rewards of running single validators dont cover the costs
363588,you can only mint when you get sponsored by an already existing member
363589,there is an issue of self sponsorship which they are addressing right now
363590,the point in qortal is not to amass money though its to create a decentralized internet
363591,p2p
363592,right now you can host simple websites on the network so the concept is proven to work
363593,also rewards progressively lower over time and eventually they will be voted by the network
363594,isnt the bigger problem that you need to be sponsored at all
363595,because based on that screenshot that stuff is moving in the opposite direction of decentralized
363596,yeah it gives a secret society vibe
363597,its more of a refferal system
363598,if there are malicious people in the set it shouldnt be too hard to mount a sybil attack which is what i think you meant when you mentioned selfsponsorship
363599,i agree its not perfect it is what it is though and you can use qortal without being sponsored sponsorship only entitles you to minting rewards
363600,you can crosschaintradechat or use websites without sponsorship
363601,anyway its just a cool unknown model which may be a valuable haven onceand if hard regulations kick in some people love this jungle aspect of crypto
363602,sure but thats a different thing
363603,reminds me of steem you could just about count the number of entities with over the network on 1 hand
363604,i have an incredibly dumb question that ctrlf and google has failed me on what is snapshotorgs business model are they a public good regular good samitarian open source project
363605,its the same as whats gnosis safe biz model
363606,well shit hosting all that infra ie graphql plugin support on the main site etc as a open source community good must be expensive found their gitcoin and will donate gitcoin seems to be disabled
363607,they did raise money not sure for what tho
363608,yeah its disabled because they raised
363609,its easy to imagine
363610,snapshot can charge to projects hosting their offchain votes in snapshot in the near future
363611,first they become indispensable and used across every project and then they start charging protocolsprojects not users
363612,i just hope they dont go publicexit through a token it would become such a shitshow
363613,is there any good website that lists events from a contract apart from etherscan
363614,
363615,
363616,feels like stripe
363617,wonder if stripe will dump crypto again now actually
363618,wait stripe dumps crypto how
363619,oh you mean as a product
363620,once upon a time they supported payments in bitcoin and then there was a bear market and then a few months ago or something since i cant actually tell time since i work in crypto they started supporting crypto payments again
363621,theyll be back when number goes up again
363622,yeah on polygon
363623,usdc only i think
363624,kek
363625,gm lobster fam today someone tried to hack samczsun with a crypto stealer fortunately attack wasnt successful but all it wouldve taken was three clicksthe first step was to create an urgent and compelling hook when placed under pressure even trained security professionals might act instinctively instead of rationally you must have good selfcontrol and feel when someone is trying to make you rush or feel strong emotions anger desire to help love envy and so on remember that time works for you and you can always wait 12 days for a similar request you should also understand that if you are in a vulnerable position not sleeping not resting starving sick you must not work and you must not do any activities that require urgency you can see the message on the screenshot if he had clicked the link then he was only in two clicks away from being pwned clicking the link automatically downloads malicious file to computer there were two files in the archive if you have file extensions enabled then youll see the first as a url if you dont then youll see the second as a pdf both of these are malicious and opening either of them would give the attacker full access to your pc and thus tokens socials sensitive data the example used wasnt very advanced but would have tricked a few users nevertheless the more targeted the harder to distinguish from legit requeststhis was very likely a redline malware or raccoon resourcesinfosecinstitutecomtopicredlinestealermalwarefullanalysisoriginal tweet read my opsec roadmap to avoid such situations never download files on your working machine you should understand all 25 rules how to store crypto securely tips from cia_officer 2 violent attack vectors in crypto a detailedreview opsec in cryptothoughtsand never forget to use dangerzonerocks when working with pdf always use a separate clean airgapped in a maximum possible way machine for work stay safe

363627,nan
363628,is there any known crypto targeting malware or attacks targeting macos users
363629,ive become complacent especially seeing all these windows specific targets
363630,of course yes there are a lot of them the thing is that exploits 0days1day for macos costs slightly more
363631,macos is just a freebsdlinux core after all with a cool interface
363632,
363633,
363634,
363635,nothing is safe guys macos is not a bulletproof system it just less popular in massive attacks but definitely not in direct attacks use this guidesgithubcomundergroundwiresprivacysexygithubcomdrduhmacossecurityandprivacyguide
363636,in other words the chances of getting into a massive attack are less but the chances of being hacked by someone who is not sorry to spend 510 thousand dollars to prepare for your hack are equal on all devices and almost all operating systems hackers also care about economics profit and cost if they are confident they can take the risk keep that in mind use qubes os or graphene os
363637,the difference seems to be that for mac the only viable attacks are spoofing or supply chain attacks embedding nasties inside apps that are legitimatepose as legitimate
363638,i run a pretty locked down system on macos just need to tighten opsec a little more
363639,but can you reasonably predict the ranking of the gas fees theyre willing to pay or is the gas fee bid info updated in real timeit seems like theres enough data to build a model
363640,there is no difference just a difference in the price of preparation and in the price of different exploits including file gluing exploits or delivery exploits they always cost more i suggest you go to zerodium and see the prices in general the toolkit is more or less the same so dont assume that macos is more secure again it is based on linux and freebsd in other words know who is working against you and what they are capable of
363641,on a related note my understanding is you can reasonably predict the depth and width of an order book which is more closely related to volume which is predictable than price not predictableis there anyone here from market making background who can confirm or at least speak on it im sure its okay to reveal what just not how
363642,im former quant from stockfuturescrypto marketsspeaking about hft predictions yes u re right butvolume is much easier to predict shortterm next min next 5 min next hoursordrebook level volumes are easier to predict moving far from fair priceob volumes near spread is almost imposible to predictprice is alsmost impossible to predict as well
363643,
363644,would love if people here contribute
363646,love to
363647,article says the technology will be integrated in their metaverse product so probably mainly iteration things
363648,
363652,thats actually interesting i do lots of midterm vol prediction daily and weekly hard to get an actual figure but ball park digit and ranking is done well what does that look like on the short term volume
363653,also has anyone tried to predict volume on amm markets and compared with clob exchanges
363654,is there any website like coingecko but for projects summary of all projects with correct tagsi rely on twitter atm lol
363655,depending on what you need maybe try pentaclexyz
363656,not as comprehensive as gecko is for tokens but theres a lot there
363657,dapplist dappradar
363658,thanks man will check it out
363659,does it cover infra companiesprojects as well
363660,i dont remember seeing them there
363661,thank you philippzentner for mentioning us hello optional1t were working improving the categories as we speak we have widened the scope of the curation to projects not just dapps as of date we cover defi nft gaming metaverse daos social media as the main categories others to cover projects from data identity more
363662,ser ivangbi i hope you wont mind if i share a link delete if you think inappropriate
363663,head over to you can see community curated projects here
363664,ok ok will take a look
363665,do let me know if youve got any feedback or suggestion for us
363666,will do
363667,thanks for listing masq
363668,youre welcome ser it was proposed by 0x27d788d thanks to the hunter voters
363669,
363670,u re nft holderu have an immunity sir
363671,how about enabling lobs holders to participate in curation ivangbi ser
363672,thank you ser
363673,better ask this in kingdom ser ok
363674,sure ser
363676,hi guys could you suggest geth cofiguration for eth full node i want to check txmempool and connect to my node with web3 js ethers metamask
363677,try erigon instead
363678,the base_reward_quotient is not final once all other protocol details are finalized it will be adjusted to target a theoretical maximum total issuance of 221 eth per year if 227 eth is validating and therefore 220 per year if 225 eth is validating etc etc
363679,what is the formula for this
363680,
363681,ive already spoken about it with a few of you but for most of you this will be new excited to share what myself and the team at revest finance have been building its a system to solve two of the biggest problems we see in the space hyperinflation and a lack of teasury management tools it does so through a combination of fnfts and integrating with yieldfarms to pay out upfront on the rights to future yield done in a way that allows for natural and continunous pricediscovery as market conditions change thanks to all my fellow lobs who have shared feedback and i hope the rest of you find it as exciting as i do mvp in q3 of this year
363682,great stuff rob ive popped this on the stack and will read and playback in dms
363683,totally not a fabricated conversation dd
363684,but on another note its yt pt tokens again like the fixed future yield
363685,this 4 real
363686,lol literally not at all didnt even know sam until we discussed eip1167 a few days back
363687,kind of but done in a way that actually acheives productmarket fit for defi its radically different than anything else that has been done because it doesnt rely on erc20s with fixedmaturities rather it utilizes 1155s with fixedterms means that you have rolling unlocks and can value the future yield with pricediscovery rather than trying to use an amm to approximate the value of a positivetheta asset
363688,looks like it
363689,our primary demographic is also quite different than anything people have done before read the medium youll understand what were doing with treasury management and how its only possible with our approach to the problem
363690,im sure there are vcs dying to fund this regardless of how futile a mission it is
363692,very cool rob definitely something i hadnt even thought about in defi what would you say this is closest to in terms of a cefi instrument
363693,the biggest hurdle i would have thought of is os but theyre building on a different fork of android lineage im interested enough to try to dig in more
363694,interest rate swaps really doesnt exist in the cefi space they dont really run into the problem of not being able to sell stocks because of industry expectations different paradigm entirely which is kinda why fixedrate stuff just hasnt hit in this market with the way its been done before were betting a deficentric approach will catch more air
363696,
363697,eth pos delays
363698,postmerge the hardware can be used to mine other cryptocurrencies that rely on the ethash algorithm or just eth classic 2
363699,likely theyve been mining themselves with these for a while and now getting rid of inventory b4 merge
363702,nist announces first pqc algoritms to be standardizedarticle comments
363703,any thoughts on how postquantum cryptography pertains to future btcethetc upgrades
363705,any tg bots that i can use to track twitter accounts using a groupchannel
363706,
363707,
363708,is etc still relevant
363710,the account model was intentionally chosen for ethereum in order to facilitate the implementation and usage of smart contracts however it causes the funds within the network to on average be more vulnerable to quantum attackswell thats interesting
363711,hey guys do you know an ui to wrap erc20 into a erc721 while being able to customize metadata
363713,were 1155 and you cant directly modify the metedata with our systemthough it does automatically display all the information about what erc20s are inside when they unlock allows you access to a web3enabled dapp as the nft to retreive the tokens etcyou can also customize the frontpanel of the dapp to display live onchain data about the locked tokens andor position
363714,that all said if that still fits the ticket definitely check out revest
363715,thanks
363717,also is there a way to check if installing such a thing doesnt harvest ones data etc
363718,anyone tried this already
363719,grapheneos only ethos looks like a bad idea actually but up to you pls use clean wallet and separate accounts anything worth a test after allbut with all security preparations
363720,oh for sure totally clean phone with all random new address to test and play am just curious how it works btw graphene does it have ethereum integration
363722,no thats an os for privacy graphene os i mean
363725,was reading through this a bit and came across this segmentwhat can one do to mitigate the risk of bitcoins being stolen by an adversary with a quantum computerin the previous section we explained that p2pk and reused p2pkh addresses are vulnerable to quantum attacks however p2pkh addresses that have never been used to spend bitcoins are safe as their public keys are not yet public this means that if you transfer your bitcoins to a new p2pkh address then they should not be vulnerable to a quantum attackis this indeed true
363726,i am curious what can be the usecase of this btw uniswap v3 supports one sided liquidity not exactly what you wanted but it does take erc20 and wraps into an erc721 representing that position
363728,the slosest thing that this resembles a bit is yearn crew made a daap for u to have nft erc20
363729,they explain it there
363730,here you goygift is an erc721 standard based nft with functionalities to hold erc20 tokens and attach string messages to a giftt via events
363731,was wondering if there is consensus on the validity of their statements because its a pretty big statement to make to say that transferring your bitcoins to a new p2pkh address prevents you from quantum attack vulnerability
363732,
363733,usecase is fun ser
363734,cant exploit what doesnt existas was mentioned above the public key cannot be retrieved from the address the public key is only revealed at the moment when the owner wishes to initiate a transaction
363735,more seriously im exploring whats possible and whats not from an artist interested in crypto pov

363742,hey guys i am trying to find out origion of dogecoin and info how and where they launched it like genesis block deployer etc anyone ever went thru any article with technical details
363743,block 0
363744,they launched it into the metaverse
363745,
363746,so we take bitcoin and we change the name ticker and the block time and slap a shiba inu on top et voila le doge is born
363747,speaking of quantum things is there any explorationinfomaterials about quantum computing blockchain beyond security but rather any theory or development in things such as how it would handle things like bridges etc
363748,a pack of guys were drinking in the chat room and well here we arethe short version was like this it seems
363749,bridges which ones
363750,astrology of dogecoin
363751,i mean not just bridges but i guess anything to do with crypto what it might look like etc
363752,i think ivangbi made it
363753,what are they there that would be strangeand its not quite correctthis is the accuracy that is needed in bridgesand quantum mechanisms do not give accuracy they give speed on some types of processesbut they make mistakesthere are also hah separate processes that should fix these errors and the aggregate design should not produce errors at a very high speed than it fixeson the other hand yes there is another side probablyim writing this now and i understand that well in fact its a consensusit is difficult to say but there is probably no direct useful for bridges and similar mechanisms at the momentbreeches and so probably with the removal isolation of the risk associated with the technical solution is the most comfortable profitable and most with low risks option to park 12 billion if you dont want to thinkcorporate will go there nowyes theyre already coming i pointed out this in the express indepth analysis of the bridge market for colleagues back in januaryusers are more needed in the bridge market users not nervous active actively using various routes here with them it turned out accidentally there are a little problembut by the way they users their loyalty and trust hah in theory can be twisted in a louder direction if we say that breeches on quantum dick work hahyes in that case its yes a very necessary and important thinghomeopathic quantum technologiessorry for my such english i dont have another write quickly one
363754,well it looks beautiful hah by the way like in moviesthis is an ordinary computer a quantum suck with a certain number of valves and a huge laser
363755,and i forgot
363756,yesterday
363757,i actually have a spare pixel 3 lying around with no data on it i can test this out and report back looks pretty suspicious tho still lmao but its a spare phone so i dont mind
363758,if this is trying to compete with the solana mobile announcement isnt the difference just that the solana mobile stack has proprietary hardware for wallet integration i feel like an os download defeats this purpose editah ok i see what their value prop is now will download and report back if anyone wants me to do a datadump lmk
363759,yeah at your own risk dont know if they have any back doors
363760,wanted to pop in to say hi hope everyones doing well
363761,i dont remember exactly but i think the ef ama on reddit the team said theyre already working on ideas to transition to the post quantum world that will use zkstarks or something to prove ownership of old addresses
363762,
363763,what happened to alameda loans
363764,good thing is liabilities assets lol
363765,liabilities 9b assets 2b
363766,generalized asset bundlerlock any combo of 207211155 into a 721
363767,lmao wtf
363768,lol that is a wide range
363769,how are they even allowed to put such a wide range
363770,doesnt make sense at all
363771,
363772,especially when this says they only have 7b aum
363773,
363774,nan
363775,alameda completely got fucked
363776,why
363777,they put debt on a company under protection ie creditor cant claim their money
363778,thatd be a first
363779,surprised alameda loan is not secured by equity
363780,do you have an article about that
363781,in the file shared above the cell about security is left blanck so the assumption is that its unsecured
363784,
363785,omfgwell 75m is not a lot for alameda
363786,they are saying bon voyage
363787,the voyage
363788,its unsecured at the same time two alameda entities are also listed as prepetition equity holders of ca 95 total in voyager
363789,so they are basically getting nothing lol
363790,not even anything from their previous stakes in the company
363791,i wonder if sam will close blockfi deal before that and bid on voyager assets
363792,they will receive what every unsecured creditors receives i assume which as per the ceo on twitter is pro rata recovery voyager tokens and equity stake in restructured entity
363794,anyone know a good api or even website to scrape that you can search x address to see what protocol its associated with
363795,debankcom
363796,should help
363797,theres an awesome repo with all the crypto apis it might be useful
363798,cryptosheets is useful if you want just d ata in excel
363802,
363803,
363804,possible to search by x contract address then get all metadata associated eg protocol logo etc
363806,let software developers get more stuff done
363807,
363808,fun windows programming 3aww
363809,many wallets use his api for this right
363810,thank you for this write up
363811,correction it seems like voyager is going to f alameda over their 75m claim will not be treated the same as customer funds
363812,one does not simply fuck over alameda
363813,75m is like a weak punch to sbf
363814,but they just did
363815,whereas account holders will receive a mixture of crypto to the extent still held by voyager voyager tokens pro rata sharing in recoveries from the 650m claim against 3ac and postreorg equity
363816,even if we assume that 75m is not dust for alameda theres probably more to this than we can see on the surface
363817,if this goes through as proposed it would set a questionable precedent for future bailouts why be a lender of last resort if alameda effectively just funded runway for voyager to go through a bankruptcy process and gets a doughnut in return not quite sure weve seen the last of it can imagine alameda will fight this
363818,you know what youre right was about to say the same thing
363819,the implications are pretty interesting on this case
363820,maybe not this time
363821,guys its a traditional corporate bankruptcy no precedent is being set if voyager has the legal right to deprioritize alameda then they do because their contract with alameda specified that and it was a negotiated term if not alameda will dispute it in bankruptcy court there are creditors committees that take care of this
363822,its a 75m loc issued by alameda there will be highly detailed terms its not some dao with no clue what they are doing voting or anything i love smart contracts a lot but weve been doing bankruptcies for 100s of years just fine itll take 24 years insane legal fees and the only real winner will be the law firms chosen to represent the creditors
363823,ser chestertons fence
363824,if the restructuring goes through and a new entity is formed alameda very likely receives most of the equity in that
363825,as per the currently proposed plan new equity is distributed to account holders only not alameda
363826,it will basically come down to the waterfall of payments if theres anything left after dealing with admin expenses account holders and secured creditors then they get something if not then they are wiped out but it should be a fairly straightforward process given most of the details were in the contracts and chapter 11 has been around for ages
363827,never a dull day in crypto
363829,btw has anyone read balajis new bookany reviews
363830,nope but im just reading this
363831,lmao okay
363832,is there any point of reading it if you followed his twitter read his substack and listened to his podcasts doubt there will be anything new in there
363833,thats what i wanted to know
363834,sup guys my friend is looking for people working for daos for an interview academic research if someone wishes to help dm please
363835,the book starts with a link to a one page essay that sums it all up and tells you too keep reading if youre into it
363836,i havent finished it but like it so far
363837,
363838,is it okay to to selfpromote a bit in this chat im asking cuz me and my cofounder are raising preseed and looking for crypto native angelsvcs
363839,imagine if everyone looking for moneyz on this bear would do the same here bro
363840,
363841,depends on the quality something unique would be kept in smth redundant like another wallet would likely be removed case by case i guess
363842,got it didnt want to spam the chat with deck or anth just say that were looking for investors that are crypto native couldnt think of a better place than the lobster chat for that
363843,anyways play is in defi ux asset management were both second time founders im harvard grad ill stop spamming now dms welcome cheers
363844,we officially released mvp on avalanche mainnet you can check it out on the first synthetic farming product is in mint session and we will open up world first synthetic farm once mint session finishes
363845,airdropped tokens to lobsterdao members now have real utility to be used as collateral
363846,
363847,i guess this is why hugomont cant have nice things
363856,was funny redacted though
363874,what are good sources to learn about the state of quantum computing and its applications for blockchains what are the current technological paradigms what problems are left unsolved how long do people anticipate itd take to be commercially viable how commercial viability is defined etc
363875,my understanding is that if you buy lobster nft you can spam more actively in the other chatthere are rumours if you buy klebanski signed one you would be able to post gifs dont quote me on that
363876,i am in the other chati still get clowned by ivan for posting my project there so this is wrong info
363877,shill time if u wanna kill bears with true chad yields join gearbox v2
363880,just launch it already
363881,without two months of build up and stories that probably only 3 people want to read naa
363882,how a fake job offer took down the worlds most popular crypto game
363883,all that from a pdf
363884,use dangerzonerocks if you are working with pdfs and please follow githubcomoffcierciacryptoopsecselfguardroadmap
363885,the social engineering is strong
363886,after what one source described as multiple rounds of interviews a sky mavis engineer was offered a job with an extremely generous compensation package
363887,am i right that this means they werent using hardware wallets for the multisig signers
363888,the fake offer was delivered in the form of a pdf document which the engineer downloaded allowing spyware to infiltrate ronins systems from there hackers were able to attack and take over four out of nine validators on the ronin network leaving them just one validator short of total control
363889,
363890,does someone have an excel sheet that can be used to do simulations about the behavior of a curve pool eg put in the avalue liquidity and other parameters and then play with it
363891,4 of 9 nodes with one engineer accessdecentralization we deserve
363892,aka 1 of 1
363893,those bridge schemes dont work with hardware wallets because they have to sign automatically in order to process the funds its not like a gnosis safes signers getting compromised
363894,shameless plug of my breakdown of ronin
363895,thing that really gets me going is theres still only 11 validators as of last check
363896,its still permissioned
363897,they completely failed in achieving their stated goals before relaunching the bridge
363898,they wanted 21 external validators seems like they have 4 external ones now
363899,either that or the block explorer doesnt function i checked with svanevik and he said nansen runs ronin validators but theyre not listed
363900,either way much room for improvement
363901,could be that that engineer had access to the vps accounts they were using to run 4 of the validators
363902,that was either enough to get direct access to those nodes or enough info for social engineering all of those cloud providers
363904,does anyone need an onchain basefeeblocknumber function
363906,nice recap for system designers
363907,
363908,weird way to phrase things
363909,yeah this is totally backward dai generates x revenue with a cost of holding its collateral nobody gets the tbill rate by holding a stablecoin the rate is to cover the costs of running a stablecoin
363910,waitwho is maker dao nowi was thinking they liquidated foundation a while ago who is dealing with centralized entities now the dao
363911,idk i just went through the forum and looked at some of the core unit forum discussions around working for maker it seems that units generate their own multisig deliver funds to contractors who setup their own llc or other then onchain votes pay bills crazy messy
363912,i just cant get it how dao is able to communicate or sign anything with anyone interesting to know more because somehow almost every defi project is a dao so hotows are always relevant for buildersivangbi i know u dont like legal talks but this question seems important and worth discussion
363913,seems to be 1 find legit custodian blackrock baillie gifford are mentioned in original forum convo2 get them to agree to follow any legally binding onchain vote3 send them dai to a designated address that will interface with them new core unit4 tokenize assets into a vault5 either ignore or figure out partial redemptions to keep native asset value nav of vault price of vault tokens honest assuming this is tokenization and not just investment of daos dai private wholesale lender monetalis will create the trust that will hold the bonds for maker but only maker will have sole control of the funds of the legal structure the maker governance will also be able to liquidate the investment via an executive vote the project stated
363914,how to build an overcomplicated fiatcoin
363915,
363916,ah the alt chain jerking off
363917,ahhhhhhhhhhh
363918,his bags are heavy knees weak down significantly
363919,smoking crack
363920,vitalik is talking with him
363921,
363922,
363923,guys are you aware of any platform that shows the utility of a specific token ie platforms where you can lend it staking locking incentivized lp platforms for it etc
363924,even coingecko and coinmarketcap provide this but this info always changes and is very on the surface so u have to dyor more
363925,agreed thats what i noticed doing some research today it looks like its harder and harder to follow new protocols and what they can provide for existing projectstokens i guess i will just keep it simple with a spreadsheet for now
363926,ehhh i get why dydx made their choice but uni being app specific chain doesnt make sense to me they need composability for their lps and are not a walled garden like dydx that said i do agree that its unclear where value capture is in the modular blockchain i would think executionlayers get competed away to near 0 given they are quickly going to be commoditized but not high conviction
363929,layer2s blow up im bearish on eth in short term but in long term im ultra bullish
363930,but if uniswap was that worried about composability they wouldnt have used nfts
363931,i think dydx and uni are having foundamentally different approach dydx doesnt really need composability at all but uni v3 needs at least some composability at least having this options for future possibilities
363932,
363933,another one seriously everyone is a vc now lol
363934,me and ivan are running a sandwich shop in dubai lies he doesnt even come for work runs somethign called gearbox when he should be focused on tiffin box
363935,this has been around for a while dont know why theyre just announcing it now i was doing research and it was surprising all these bonds are finally coming in
363936,whats your best sandwich
363937,ot for this chat pls join lobster kingdom for more details thx
363938,okay okay
363939,does anyone have any book recommendations for advanced options trading
363940,do the opposite of cexs
363941,they buy you short
363942,simple
363944,dynamic hedging by taleb is the most fun to read the utility of all the books however is very low experience is everything
363945,it would be more correct to say dydx can afford to be indifferent about composability they arent some unknown new thing thats willing to overcompensate for the lowest common denominator just so they can get their first users they already have users and clout so composability is a nicetohave and be on their terms i doubt uniswap is different in this regard
363946,unfortunately i only trade stock market options lol
363947,thank you i will make sure to look into them
363948,read financial hacking by phillip maymim its unconventional in its approach but will teach you how to think about things in a real world sense we can all do the calculations required for options the math isnt the hard part its more the common sense
363949,
363950,can anyone recommend discord bot for this usecasewhen an broadcast telegram channel posts smth it auto posts on discord
363951,check if u can use discord webhooks for this
363952,can do tg zapier discord
363953,any bot for when someone tweets it posts to tg channelgroup
363954,zappier does this sorry i keep repeating same thing explore it youll get what you need
363955,check iftt also
363956,thank you
363957,despite voyagers claims its bank says fdic insurance will not protect customer usd deposits from firms bankruptcy

363961,
363962,forgive me for this journalistic crime quick take voyager digitals bankruptcy will put clients in a bind despite earlier promises about fdic insurance voyager has told customers that they will get their funds back following a reconciliation process with metropolitan commercial bank a statement from the bank placed the responsibility for reimbursing customers with voyageron tuesday night crypto broker voyager digital filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in new yorkearly wednesday morning the firm released a statement downplaying the bankruptcy calling it a voluntary chapter 11 processhowever the outlook for customer funds is grim and subject to the complexities and potential long duration of the bankruptcy process in its statement voyager said that customers with crypto in their accounts will receive in exchange a combination of the crypto in their accounts proceeds from the 3ac recovery common shares in the newly reorganized company and voyager tokensalso of potential worry are the prospects for customers holding us dollars with the firm given what appears to be a misrepresentation of the insurance backing their usd bank holdings while the firm has never held insurance with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in previous marketing materials voyager digital llc had touted that usd held with voyager is now fdic insured citing its strategic banking partnerships the fdic came about as a reaction to the bank runs of the early great depression to serve as a federal backstop for funds that financial institutions failed to redeem to clients specifically voyager had promised in its december 2019 post that means that in the rare event your usd funds are compromised due to the company or our banking partners failure you are guaranteed a full reimbursement up to 250000however voyagers own customer agreement appears to contradict that claim fdic insurance does not protect against the failure of voyager or any custodian as defined below or malfeasance by any voyager or custodian employee it readsvoyager holds customer usd with metropolitan commercial bank while metropolitan commercial bank is fdicinsured it appears that insurance does not kick in the event that voyager fails wednesday morning voyager wrote customers with usd deposits in their accounts will receive access to those funds after a reconciliation and fraud prevention process is completed with metropolitan commercial bankwhen reached for comment a representative for voyager repeated this line and declined further comment the spokesperson also declined to answer a question about how long that reconciliation and fraud prevention process will take meanwhile metropolitan commercial bank has put out its own announcement for voyager customers the bank identified voyagers usd holdings as being within a single omnibus accountand while voyager said earlier that all us regulatory obligations associated with the movement of and holding of usd in connection with each account are the responsibility of the bank mcb stated that voyager is responsible for maintaining records to determine the ownership and amount of each of its customers funds on deposit in the omnibus accountmcb further clarified the limits of fdic insurance in its statement namely it said that the fdic is not going to pay out over voyagers failure fdic insurance coverage is available only to protect against the failure of metropolitan commercial bank fdic insurance does not protect against the failure of voyager any act or omission of voyager or its employees or the loss in value of cryptocurrency or other assetsthe function of a limited liability corporation is clearly to limit liability a chapter 11 bankruptcy process exists to disengage from debts consequently voyagers customers should be wary metropolitan commercial bank had not responded to a request for comment as of press time
363963,via kollen post
363964,i wonder if this could this be somewhat automated by watching onchain activity care to share the spreadsheet
363965,matterbridge
363966,i used to think all fdic insurance is the same for all banks and fintechs does this mean coinbase and binanceus usd account could fall in the same category
363967,correct me if i am wrong but it seems like the same applies for coinbase
363968,random but could someone explain why some coins have the max supply figure as well while others just display the total supply which is used to calculate the fdv
363969,max supply is for protocollevel inflation
363970,total supply is the current total tokens in existence
363971,ie in this example therea another 459m tokens that dont exist yet but can
363972,thank you this is what i figured what are some reasons that could cause supply to go beyond the total supply this is a screenshot of metis fwiw could a reason be in case they want to raise more funding using tokens
363973,some tokens dont have a practical max supply it very much means exactly what it says
363974,if you take luna as an example
363975,that had scope for infinite supply managed by the supply needed to maintain the ust peg

363989,maker dao is in deep trouble if this is the level of thought leadership involved the lawyer in the video is about to launch a governance proposal to be paid 500k for 6 months retainer making her one of the most expensive lawyers in ny the retainer proposal included open hour sessions and only one person turned up to watch this first oneaside from the clickbait title there is very little of interest here so please dont try to watch the whole thing unless its necessary youll get the gist of the situation in the first 2 minutes
363990,looks like that proposal will be defeated for a number of reasons cost csuite implications delegateclo conflict of interest and more
363991,hahaha im tempted to put up my own proposal saying ill do it for 450k
363992,420k take it or leave it
363993,have some friends in for a race to the bottom
363994,we need someone who will do it because they enjoy it and if people really cared about the dao theyd do it for free
363995,im sure someone can get bob odenkirk to do the sessions as saul goodman for less
363996,perhaps but the amount of support for the proposal on her thread was surprising
363997,if shes a helpful and well liked community member they may obviously be okay with her participating at some level with some compensation just not in the way shes hoping or for the amount shes hoping
363999,i was cheeky and quoted it on the forum for 250k because i know whats involved in the role
364000,of course i also feel a bit conflicted because we definitely need more women and more minorities involved in this space its a shame the proposal was so offbeam
364001,lol am i reading this correct that she is also a delegate
364002,pretty sure shes the one that responded to blec about getting bootstrapped by a16z
364003,someone should make a proposal for a chief reporter whose job is to keep up with all of these dao proposal and post daily summary
364006,correct but she has agreed to minimise any conflicts im not sure how she does that as a delegate because the delegators whove delegated voting power are not themselves conflicted only she is and then theres the obvious ongoing conflict if she is awarded the role how can she properly advise the dao if she is the direct beneficiary of decisions she makes finally the dao isnt a client there is no client here so the proposal starts to look less like a legal retainer and more like a stressfree wellpaid consulting gig
364007,is her proposal directly related to the love and real world investments that makr has been debating on
364008,partly but the remit she developed for the role is really broad its a clo role so will include bau legal support reviewing docs and wips why hiring a team etc unfortunately shes only qualified in ny and cant advise on any of the caymans issues that still exist so the proposal budget will blow out significantly
364009,agree w this take for such an amount you are paying someone to get creative and take some risks with a pioneering legal dao role someone sent her me her office hourswhich was mostly a lot of prevarication about how atty ethics rules would play into her role this is not a good signneed someone bold who is set in their mind to take some risks and be a pioneer and always deliver strong value without getting bogged down in cya issuesi do think the high compensation could be well worth it for the right type of legal pioneer but doesnt seem this is her
364010,im a dao lawyer with much more reasonable rates
364011,even if people are qualified in ny theres still plenty of ny issues that they might need to seek outside counsel on the law is a huge beast one lawyer can only really stay up to date and knowledgable about a select few areas

364053,i think we are doing that
364054,is it lpl approved
364055,just asked if someone can see something better
364056,i guess we need something for documentation or money collection or explosive materials cause this topic is very specific

364063,celsius has finished paying its loan to maker dao and got 21962 wbtc 440m in collateral back link
364064,theyve sent it to ftx it seems like sorry my bad its in a wallet which they use to send stuff to ftx not that it has been sent
364065,
364066,sooner
364067,
364068,
364069,nan
364070,yikes
364071,btc is headed for ftx it seems
364072,taker from maker
364073,wait whhaaaaaaaaat
364074,ded
364075,i mean ghosted
364076,i am ghoooooing
364077,to 0
364079,proposal details
364080,is this a response to removing dai module from aave i dont think so this must have been int he works for months
364081,probs
364082,meanwhile curve loving all the new stablecoins competing for liquidity and volume
364083,share the same opinion theyre expanding the business model and betting on their arc venture it seems
364084,just wait until they come up with their own lol
364085,actually the proposal is very scarce in terms of details
364086,
364087,or did i miss some folded link the full architecture details lts etc
364088,not sure if that would help them get more volume and trading fees and then all the cost and headaches with building and managing that
364089,celestia is badass at ethnyc i overheard more than one high level vc discussing it in private not even from a perspective of we invested but from a perspective of do you believe in eth or evm longterm
364090,alfa plz ser
364091,that was it i signed up for their waitlist to run a node lets see what comes from it
364092,considering there isnt a token yet there is no real actionable alpha except trying to become part of their node network
364093,oops we dont have it until q42022
364094,celestia is more of a 2025 play
364095,2023 play for builders
364096,docs on the aave stable
364097,l2 report vol 4
364098,
364099,why near didnt focus on their sharding tech
364100,what are they doing
364101,evm algo stable and recently they want to connect to ibc
364102,like a salad bowl
364103,anyone know minimum needed to vote in makeraave proposals
364104,curious why youre building thisdo you see it becoming a good business one or more of a public good interesting project to work on
364105,how does it work if gho is above peg for any reason its profitable to mint gho with for example another stablecoin and short it on stableswaps and earn slippagewith emode very efficient leverage can be enabled to do this both ways
364106,the first statement is true for maker or any overcoll stable or any stable mint more to bring down the peg an arbitrage essentially the latter refers to a slight leverage twist i believe not sure
364107,
364108,ah nono just higher ltv for some
364109,yeah understand the first part ofc gonna dyor what earn on slippage means
364110,anyone have a good tutorial on how to set up natspec crawler
364111,you can mint more efficiently so arbitrage more efficiently as a result
364112,web2 arbitrage model isnt this why psm was designed in maker
364113,diff set of who makes money and who benefits from it but ye i think so
364114,yea but with slippage at zero so no cost at all to close the arb
364115,can you eli5 please slippage where
364116,the facilitators that are whitelisted by gov that mint based on emode and stake aave are going to be the more profitable ones lowest ir and high ltv
364117,1 usdc 1 daipsm price stability mechanismif 1 usdc is the same as 1 dai you can hardpeg it easily
364119,oh u mean maker yes i understand psm i wonder how this works for gho
364120,i used to run a lot of unconferences and communities of practice mainly for engineers and setup a few decentralisedcommunity orgs then quit to be a solo builder when i went back to it to help out with eips i couldnt find the tool i really wanted the use cases are all either for controlled environments or centrally controlled user groups so seems a good chance to build sth fun and see where it goes
364121,inverse finance
364122,if they wont get hacked twice for all user funds and they seem to profit aavestaked aave holders i think its a good step tbh
364123,though i dont think we need 500 stablecoins
364124,what about them
364125,they doing basically that anchoraave like protocol own stable
364126,welp they had to do it to basically mask the bad debt and they did it in a very proper way good job tbh
364127,is what the aave thing is with some makerdao spice given the real world assets as collateral bent being advertised
364128,you mean inverse they did it long before the bad debthacks occurred that was just the point they started trying to grow it because a down only token bad debt couldnt feed anyone anymore
364129,i dont wanna shit on aave cause i am frens and they are cool af builders and so on but my small brain doesnt comprehend why go into such a risky reg wise business as stables and next to that the proposal seems pretty trivial as in the design of the stablecoin is pretty much a ye ok lets adapt this that seems a bit too easy i get it the reason to do it is why not and move into undercoll maybe later too idk just braindump would deffo use it cause it shall be pretty safe better than dai at this point probably would apply for undercoll as a protocol d
364130,more ways to earn money and eventually give aave token a usecase doesnt sound too bad for meregulatory wise i agree but guess thats why you put it on a dao vote
364131,yeah inverses version is old older than even terras anchor
364132,exactly having a hard time understanding this move
364133,whats the proper way to pronounce steth is it like teeth steeth or steth like the eh sound in f or step
364134,nan
364135,steeeeth
364136,sounds a bit like std which is fitting in a way
364137,st as in stuck and eth as in eth
364138,greetings i want to ask whether it is allowed to share in the lobster chat info about a new opensource product and invite private beta testers
364139,stehth
364140,small question how would you identify those defi protocols with high levels of leverage
364141,wdyt in a bad way or what
364142,i am basically interested in seeing those protocols where the most leverage is currently in place dunno if that is something that you can actually see
364143,i mean where the users are leveraging positions
364144,its even weird to put the proper question down
364145,not sure still what you mean but lending protocols allow for inherent leverage like 3x usually max even less that is because those protocols are not aimed at leverage as the first use case the reason why such things appear is usually1 farming opportunities recycling capital to farm more but for euler farmers for now that has been a total loss afaik a friend farmed2 arbitraging the peg between borrow and supply side inside the same protocol like aaves steth eth folded positions3 in maples case some users went around the design of the protocol used the capital they got to lp back in for rewards see 1
364146,nan
364147,up please update us about this
364149,what is the business model
364150,at the moment it is an open qustion and it depends on the number of attracted users the most optimal way is to earn on swap commisions in our wallet and on other pro features that we plan to introduce
364151,the face on your avatar created by ai which is certainly a red flag because it is an impostor
364152,i am a marketer manager that promoting wallet in different channels and it is high chances to be banned because of sharing links sorry i dont want to risk my real profile i think the most important question who is a founder and a core team and they use real accounts and you can check their profiles and expertise
364153,is it open source audited
364154,it hasnt audited yet that is way we ask to use only new accounts and testnets we will opensource all code after the audit conduction
364155,so you came in with a fake pfp to shill a wallet on the surface that sounds a little shady
364156,great catch how did you know
364157,an open source wallet thats not open source
364158,because i was once a victim of a scammer with kinda fake pfp
364159,we dont plan to make the wallet open source before audit because we had several requests to fork our solutions and it will be not good if someone uses not an audited solution after the audit we will provide 100 access to the wallet code
364160,we shoulddworl on a post quantum blockchain
364161,the first 5 words are all you need
364162,looked a bit into curve pools stuff today volume changes focus on steth pool somebody might find it interesting so sharing it
364163,maybe after your audit and you post the code would be a better time to shill the wallet
364165,aave companies has one of the best legal team of the market i wouldnt be too worried about regulatory overhead tbh the interesting part is the composability of it all its going to create very cool interactions
364166,if only project had accumulated stkaave for this
364169,redacted outright shilling kept questionposts thx for fair replies gn
364170,what do you have in mind ser like wut
364171,well think of aave as a central bank they dictate monetary policy but any facilitator has the right to mint and manages their own risk basically aave is upgrading from a credit company to a central bank
364172,is that going to be the end goal of all lending services
364173,
364174,if anyone was confused about the snx atomic swaps
364175,ukraine charity shill post hey everyone besides being a regular lobster and crypto person i run a charity in ukraine logistics have been difficult and civilians as well as military units run out of life saving aid frequently it can take a long time days to weeks to receive resupply which is very bad when youre for example out of chest seals or insulin lastmileaidcom helps to fill those gaps we have a warehouse in dnipro and are building an ever growing stock of supplies mostly medical we are in direct contact with front line soldiers and civilians so that if they run out of anything we load up one of our suvs and deliver to anywhere on the front we were in lysychansk and slovyansk just a couple weeks ago so we really go anywhere that is not occupied reason i am posting i know a lot of crypto projects have done amazing work raising money to support ukraine i am looking for intros to them so we can help them deliver their supplies where they are needed most any connections would be appreciated ive been self funding it entirely so far cars fuel supplies etc and was in ukraine for 8 weeks and planning on moving there for the rest of the year to scale this if anyone is interested in donating money that will be used to purchase supplies and save lives thatd be much appreciated as well
364176,do you guys think steth will ever go back to 095 levels
364177,just bumping that this guy is legit met many times in ch sorry if offtopic
364178,what up sebastian
364179,hopr gang
364180,prolly not 3ac and celcius were huge forced sellers
364181,doubt that happens again
364182,just aped in steth on zkmoney good fun
364183,
364184,tldr we will lobby what we think around the world over the next years having bilateral agreements and may be alliances
364185,
364186,so celsius isnt able to farmdeposit their money into lps themselves but is supposed to hedge the exposure and il 11 3
364189,i mean didnt they have 150 heads
364190,the only explanation is cel had absolutely no investment know how they only knew how to get money from people and hoped to skim off the top what they outsource classic skem
364191,yeah makes no sense only thing i can think is eg if they said they have other parts of their funds so hedge as a total folio but bit weird
364192,didnt they farm sushi and other well known stuff
364193,my guess is oxb1 lost money doing stupid shit sued by celsius and now this is the counter tldr both idiots
364194,its not like super degen stuff
364195,they were aping into complete nonsense
364196,pretty complex and amount of collateral required to hedge 2b of il is no small task
364197,multiple hacks too
364198,exactly
364199,pool2 is as degen as it gets
364200,so basically the glorious b1 were just degen idiots playing someone elses money with no accountability
364201,whos fault is that tho
364202,not b1s
364203,even if true
364204,both turned out to be a complete dumbasses lol
364205,money iq
364206,money iq if its your own money
364207,sure but if one dumbass gives another dumbass his money to manage i blame dumbass 1 for any damage lol
364208,but if hundreds of dumbasses give money to cel to manage under false marketing isnt it a scam
364209,yes
364210,bitconnnneeeeeeeeeeect
364211,neds more es
364212,ig i just mean that i see no fault in 0xb1 for aping into food farms if thats what they were hired to do and they were told celsius was watching and hedging
364213,sure true just saying b1 was hot ct back in the day for no good reason seriously crypto never learns maybe we should just go to zero and forget about all this blockchain nonsense
364214,0xb1 being celsius was pretty known
364215,people been calling out their shit for a while
364216,the only reason was cause they were big degen apees and people just wanted them to buy thier bags innit
364217,so was cel one of these institutions everyone was claiming are coming to crypto in 2021 or something
364218,are we unwinding that narrative
364219,celsius is from 2018
364220,yeah but the 2b are not
364221,its not like it popped out of the ether
364222,the only people surprised by whatever this is are people that bought into the fraud that is cedefi
364223,their business model from the very start has always been you give us your money we do something youre apparently too lazy to do yourself keep some profit and give you the rest
364224,people complaining about getting rekt now werent complaining when it was going well and they were being warned funny how that works
364225,i say steph in my head
364226,i mean the returns for people werent that crazy was quite minimal compared to weekly price changes in crypto holding funds in a bank giving you a few percent per year is one of the least degen things you can do same for terra usd holders they thought they were being conservative and frankly almost no one knew these would blow up as they did i personally stayed away from all these schemes because j didnt understand them or have the time too but its unfair to call these people degenerates because they really werent degens hold their own eth and buy nfts and farm random nonsense
364227,lol the turns sure have tabled in crypto if holding your money is degen whereas giving it to some smoothtalking 3rdparty business with a blackbox scheme to magic out profit is deemed conservative and safe
364228,well it was safe till 2 months ago
364229,then they should take the safe losses in stride
364230,not saying this was smart but the people doing it were often not degenijg 520 is boring we want 10x
364231,not really it sucks worse at least if you lost on your risky play you realised the risk here the risk was hidden so felt safe
364232,nothing was hidden
364233,the risk was clear to anyone that had followed celsius and similar constructs since their launch
364234,the 2m or so people that sent them money didnt see it as a risky place to put money
364235,well now they know
364236,thats just the reality if you were smarter than them then good for you
364237,yup
364238,i was just too lazy to get in and research count myself lucky for a while i thought i was leaving money on the table
364239,they didnt see anything beyond high apr
364240,and didnt want to ask how
364241,i deemed the risks irrelevant when i thought i would profit but now im rekt im going to say the risks were hidden is the sort of ridiculous minimization that leads to protec investors where the investors really need a straitjacket
364242,high apr being under 10
364243,celsius has its strategies earns more than the amount it pays you everyone winsi assume thats the basics for those that wanted to understand cant really go much deeper than that seems like others were more responsible than celsius with the same model
364244,lol sending nfts to wife from 0xb1
364245,nan
364252,nan
364253,nan
364254,nan
364255,holy sht
364257,you can wrap any native coin erc20 or even erc721 1155dapp docs source see careful there are dozens usecases for wrapped nfts
364258,what about that billion tether loan
364264,
364265,really cool use of rollups privacy lower costs of txs all executed on eth
364267,i think myether team stopped working on it long ago always same error send button become gray its frustrating as hell any alternative solution
364268,no they didnt
364269,you might want to reconsider screenshotting your wallet balance
364270,is this more private than something like tornado cash
364271,this isnt a rollup its just polygon with extra steps
364272,from what i gather it would look like pretty similar from the outside
364273,hm tell me about it
364274,an anonymity pool smart contracts executing calldata for a lot of people
364275,not sure if anyone from aztec is here to do a really dumb tldr hehe
364276,yeah were going to have a completely different chain where correct execution is enforced by community so when the sequencer decides to scam you the community can send a stronglyworded letter
364277,oh and it also saves blockdata to some data availability layer for some reason
364278,gud thread on bancor
364279,
364281,gonna need a little more info ser
364289,bancor isnt a uni v2 fork the thread is really wide of the mark
364290,best crypto ux communities
364291,bancors problems stem from socializing il via bnt printing combined with ridiculous lm rewards v3 compounded this by having a completely different deficit driven definition of il which exacerbated lp losses when the ilp was turned offits screwed probably for a long time but isnt a uni fork uni implemented derivative of bancors original mechanism
364305,does a gasless signature request get published onchain for example how did optimism know who participated in governance votes for their airdrop if governance votes are simply signature requests
364306,when you sign they save the data somewhere no
364307,snapshot does
364308,index front running is not illegal though coz its a trading strategy
364309,meanwhile
364310,someone rug pulled euro lol
364311,lagarde keeps isnt that much different from bnt
364318,not just germany
364319,uk are in the same boat
364320,to 50 increases in 6 months
364322,we have a price cap in place by the energy regulator
364324,can confirm not living there anymore but fam still there and they aint happy about energy prices atm
364327,
364328,happy times
364330,that wasnt driven by germany
364332,also can we cut the armchair political non crypto macro discussions here
364335,buy a lobs nft and macro shitpost with us in lobsterdao kingdom limited offer on opensea available now
364337,yeah i am paying almost 100 to refill my car crazy times
364338,just bought one thx
364339,that and seeing ivan cry about his investments make it 100 worth can only recommend
364341,no way its time to duel
364343,this has been my biggest concern and you can already see mass protests in various countries as a result at this rate it isnt going to take long to get to uncontrollable social instability and mass violence
364344,not trying to be hyperbolic either
364348,lets just hope the uprising will be mostly against politics and people defending them sadly most people will rather fight each other instead of fighting the real reason of this so called economic crisis
364351,gm friendly reminder that you need gearbox because your size is not sizeivangbi does nto have me at gunpoint for saying this
364352,if it has some reversecopyivan mode
364353,lmao
364354,
364355,hey guysis variable apyapr
364356,no this is tricky
364357,apy compounding interest apr noncopounding right
364358,yes
364359,its not you can rephrase your question to get more comprehensive answer
364360,thanks everyone
364361,play with numbers sir
364363,silly question what is the plan for crv when emissions end the entire curve ecosystem is based on emissions existing no probably i am missing something
364364,thats a question for year 2300 no
364365,it is i have not verified someone told me its in 3 years and i did not verify
364371,not sus at all
364372,is that a botted conversation
364373,dog do you really need to ask
364374,this sentence is tho
364376,does anyone know when c98 vesting starts this julyivan pls dont delete i couldnt dyor
364377,as far as i understand yes but the anonimity set is everyone on aztek
364378,not necessarily vecrv gets the admin fees from trading
364379,maybe they got confused with cvx which has a higher level of total supply already emitted
364380,any seafood in paris
364381,such anonymity pools might be very risky when regulation hits
364382,if regulators flags tornado cash contract for example all involved are flagged as well
364383,there are workarounds ofc but imo is not the best privacy especially when you have to join a pool with hackers and the likes
364384,tldr you dont need tornado if youre legit
364385,but would that be enough to sustain it as an ecosystem seasaltyfunk yeah maybe they meant cvx
364386,real privacy is cross chain
364387,icp will be interesting to play with when btc integration hits
364388,not cross layer but cross chain avax polygon and the likes arent in the picture
364390,what a ridiculous shill
364391,
364393,
364395,curious what peoples opinions are on this and if theres any type of general consensus in the space
364396,better guardrails are needed for cryptocurrencies to protect small investors and to dampen any risks that might emerge as the industry grows federal reserve vice chairwoman lael brainard said fridayah guardrails
364397,same opinion as on every etf coming soon etf not coming lets ban pow lets subsidize pow dictatorship adopts bitcoin and other non headline headlines none of this matters
364398,have they considered i dunno banning these people that clearly would be better off not dabbling in crypto
364399,shes a career bureaucrat raised by another bureaucrat who has a strong allegiance to the political machine that gives her power
364400,anyone know how this works
364401,optimism did not take simple signers only those who executed txs no
364402,dao voters
364403,snapshot stores past votes on ipfs somewhere its offchain
364405,still waiting for one single investor saved because of regulations
364410,ahh legal again ok done
364411,ohh i see
364412,jfc how many companies gave 9 figures to 3ac
364413,
364414,1inch offering 2m in public grants maybe they should repay all the users slippage they steal
364416,uniswap gives 70m to their friends i sleep1inch giving grant to develop ecosystem wide_awakejpg
364417,nah u r both wrong
364418,anyone makes money i am unhappy and protest
364419,grants are always money for the friends
364420,
364421,
364422,so oxb actually lost 350 mill worth of user funds but as they want to denominate it in usd instead of the assets they receivedusers staked they actually even want profit share
364423,does anyone know if there is a standard library or contract that protocols use for linear vesting oz wallet vesting does not seem like an appropriate solution for transferring tokens to different roles does each protocol design their own contract as a solution
364424,poorer people are saved from making money all the time accredited investors are able to get in on risky speculative investments that common people could never handle like uber then when the companies go public regular investors are saved yet again because the accredited investors can safely supply them with their holdings im worried about the next few years in the eu personally the proposed mica bill which was approved without the consent of the public is essentially a crypto surveillance package
364425,sablier has a standard one that aave team used
364426,
364427,
364428,i always lol at this meatspace thing when a pdf with numbers is considered a proof of anything
364429,has anyone tried transferring a lens protocol handle nft from one wallet to another does it do what youd assume and transfer ownership minus following activity unless you transfer those too
364430,it should because the onchain part of the protocol is pretty simple and most of the magic sauce comes from the indexer
364431,i will try to find it but is that not like a money streaming that pays contributors by the second instead of an actual token vesting
364436,yes its becoming china numba 1where to though
364438,georgia
364439,country or the state
364440,presuming countrythanks for the suggestions folks was considering bali after next bull if we make it there i think right now people are getting super pissed at central planners and becoming more aware of things like the wefs agendathe next few years are going to be interesting to say the least clutching for control but the more they squeeze
364441,country
364442,im leaving switzerland for dubai
364443,you can use my contracts they are also integrated in llamapay ui
364444,this might be ok
364445,use furo if you want it to be paid in weeklymonthlyetc installments
364446,stupid question why is there no metamask for this
364447,metamask sucks just use frame
364448,frame is great never looked back
364449,i find it has a lot of errors wrt injecting into websites ux needs work for sure fuck consensys and all but metamask is a fantastic and simple product
364450,wdym
364452,maybe because you dont have metamask either logged in or not installed
364453,hmm wierd
364454,same same but different kudos to who wrote that fe for implementing brave specific logic altho its giving a more confusing ux than just calling it metamask
364456,why would it be confusing to have the name of the wallet youre actually using there instead of the name of a wallet you dont have installed
364457,im sure its literally just asking the ambient contextual web3 client hey what should i call you
364458,just a very long switch statement to catch all the different cases most opt for a generic web wallet or smth like that
364459,im pretty sure there is a function call that returns the name of the wallet
364460,given that on many sites i see hey you already have frame installed maybe try metamask because im stupid and im pretty sure they didnt literally check all the potential wallet names that may not even have existed when the code was written to come up with that
364461,anybody know of a project that uses something like to manage multiple underlying tokens eg something like one tokeninterface that would allow for the unwrapping of multiple crv pool positions
364462,elon musk ends 44bn bid to buy twitter
364463,
364464,any reason why uniswap has always been a poor experience for me am i doing something wrong swap button takes multiple clicks before transaction pops up takes long to update button after approving a token every process just takes very long compared to swapr sushi etc
364465,
364466,thevergetwitter says its going to sue elon musk for trying to back out of the deal
364467,seems like the instant sell price is the same as prices offer bots are willing to pay
364468,howdy happy to answer qs
364469,sad no erc1155 support apparently
364470,i think it will be released soon according to the tweet
364471,yeah no 1155 support yet will be adding another pool factory for it
364472,some differences between fungibility either between ids or just for 1 id means we need to rewrite a bit of the codebase
364473,cool i like the idea
364474,congrats
364475,
364476,
364477,sad to see this happen we need more deleverage in the system
364478,sent you a dm ser
364479,canadas internet company rogers rugged phone and internet taking the banksinterac and 911 services along with it super fun
364481,i have the same problem with sushi lol changing browser helped me
364482,it does seem to work better on a new browserpc wondering what i could do to make the experience better on the browser i want to use it on
364483,what browser are you using it on
364484,chrome
364485,do you have a lot of extensions generally if you find it runs well in incognito with only mm enabled thats the culprit
364486,how many would you consider a lot
364488,its an rpc issue not a uniswap issue
364489,if you have to ask you probably have too many each one is also a potential security riskenable mm for incognito try there and if it fixes it you know you have too many either disable some or create a new profile with minimal extensions and use that for defi
364496,
364500,donations bro
364501,static site hosting is rather inexpensive
364503,lots of money doesnt guarantee safety sometimes it can do quite the opposite by aligning incentives over users best interestsfeel free to look around for better options anyone who knows trusts the llamas
364507,memes in kingdom
364508,you can dont use it too do for convenience we still here debating about its security and decentralisation lulz
364509,is there wallet that allows the following user a controls keys and can allow user b to use the wallet user b can sign transactions but has no access to keys
364510,or at the very least has no obvious access to keys ie through interface
364511,you cant sign without a key
364512,and if you can interface as you mention your keys are now in 5 different servers so nah
364513,i know that but theoretically you could pull keys from the server
364514,
364515,and maybe drink water from the slurp
364516,the closest probably is gnosis safe or credit accounts where there can be an operator but certain transactions like withdraw or trade which makes hf 1 are not permitted
364517,basically the goal is to make someone sybil attack everything for me
364518,too smooth brain for automatization too lazy to do it myself
364519,you are likely too late to the game
364520,narnia chads had 100 coinlist accounts back in 2019 already
364521,its no longer profitable but you can try to be ready for the next platform to moon shitcoins
364522,wasnt talking about coinlist it is bot farms game
364523,vanity create 100 accounts and make them bridge stuff that u can do already
364524,ur own server but u need to be tech savvy
364525,and also you are late
364526,just check the billion bots on arbitrum
364527,late or not late isnt the point there is always some long tail stuff that can be exploited for profit besides good implementation of the delegating wallet control basically allows me to have ppl participate in anything on my behalf
364528,ps narnia is toxic dumpster fire
364529,u r attempting the same ser lol
364530,anyway banteg used ds proxy stuff on multiple wallets back in basis cash times je publicly talked about it one server with multiple signatures multisend eth to all for gas fees harvest brr
364531,wouldnt it make interacting with web apps very difficult
364532,you can use hsm hardware machines the keys are generated inside and no one can extract themso admin can control the access to machine and user b can send there transactions to sign
364533,u interact w contracts on the backend directly nothing frontend related
364534,cause why
364535,can send there transactions to sign
364536,and what do you approve then though and how
364537,if you need to control what you approve then need to build some web service around it
364538,exactly i am arguing against your case
364539,there is also fireblocks solution to build lot of policies but this shit is expensive
364540,maybe jhedglin can explain it if he has time
364541,you can pretty much host a site like that for free
364542,with good enough security on cloudflare provided you are not the weakpoint
364545,
364546,llamapay vesting as well
364547,yeah bitgo hsm multisig fireblocksmpc and qredompc all have these key management solutions with policies but are also pretty expensive depends what you are trying to control for
364548,anyone here tried tokenized property investing like lofty ai on algorands network looks like an interesting way to invest apart from hodling
364549,why that reaction
364550,cause algorand is fugezi fugazi
364552,anyway yes there was realt propy and stuff like that mostly buying detroit stuff for passive cashflow and idk
364553,ah i see im not sure about passive earning because i see you can sell at anytime well ty anyway
364554,oh wait i see what you mean i thought they buy and sell properties for profit but i see there are rentals
364555,because the message looks like standard shil have u already tried x on z chainpeople dont like that and do dislikeswere not deleting just because its funny afhonest opinion
364556,okay i get it now
364557,damn propy i memba
364558,remember charlie shrem michigan dump project
364559,mainstreet
364561,i have an article about apy vs apr probably might be helpful
364563,hello all im wondering what sources people here use to keep up to date with the general crypto world new protocols interesting governance proposals research articles etc would appreciate if you could share which ones you use
364564,yep i did i transfered multiple to dif wallets and works
364565,secondary market for good names soon lol
364566,i am guessing some people would want them
364567,oh for sure
364568,
364569,messari governor is great for keeping up with different proposals
364570,ah yes messari is awesome i already use their news page too thanks for the suggestion
364571,sure for new protocols and such defillama is hard to beat for various tools and resources i maintain this compendium of all kinds of things
364572,hahaha wow this is sick
364573,i think ill be good with this appreciate it
364574,your profile pic is really cool
364575,actually a good one
364576,this makes me think has anyone made a proposal about maker dao becoming a landlord and buying condos
364577,a project recently did this but it was in january i think pretty sure it failed citadao was the name if memory serves me correctly
364580,
364581,superfluid does this i think
364582,llamapay too
364583,anyone from dark forest game here
364584,sounds like cftc needs to ramp up their surveillance anyone here familiar with their market surveillance operations
364585,and that begs the question who are surveillance players in the crypto markets i found but clients are usually centralized orgs looking to get on the good side of cftc not seeing any decentralized players
364586,does anyone know a tool that compares two almost identical smart contracts and shows their different code lines
364587,diffchecker
364588,diffecker also githubcombeyondacmsmartembed githubcomskalermosmartdiffer
364589,also etherscan
364590,tokensniffer
364591,this has a diff function
364596,
364599,
364600,
364601,nothing new here
364602,anyone know what the best way to turn 1 minute videos into nfts
364603,depends on which chain imo
364604,well i saw this and was wondering if using glassxyz is the best option thus far or are there are other ways that can be recommended
364605,ge lobster fam just wanted to share with you my new article on opsec topic i hope it will help someone
364606,
364607,lol what they seriously went anon
364608,is there anywhere i can view the most active governance protocolscommunities
364609,messari governor is probably best for this theres also dao poll that gives alerts on some of the more active protocols
364610,thank you
364611,dao surv the ones who built dao poll have a telegram group where you can ask them to add different protocols and such to be monitored by the bot if there are certain ones you want to watch
364612,has any major eth project moved to solana on grounds of scalability
364614,hi can anyone help mewhy am i getting reverted with an unrecognized custom error here
364615,reverted in hardhat but succeeded in rinkby testnet
364616,too late for them to be anon now
364617,most recent 22 sec statements circle 80 us treasury bonds and 20 cash all highly liquid assets i agree that 1 a digital bankrun is easier and has proven successful by actors luna celsius vauld blockfi etc 2 its unclear if not happening though unsolvability of circle is going to affect usdc holders that might prove a problem someday so keep running a tight ship there and we be fine
364618,is there a list somewhere of most viral tweets in ct
364619,brave but they label is multi chain
364620,console log success i think its because your revert condition is expecting return data but the call isnt returning anything
364621,one of the issues with call is you have to handle failures properly so i would revert if not successful
364622,might a stupid question but i personally have made this mistake in the past and spent too much time finding it have you made sure that the block number that youre using for pinning the hardhat mainnet fork is more recent than seaports deployment block
364623,
364624,i always thought they added native support for sol dapps etc after eth and bsc ecosystems via their integration but not necessarily _move_
364625,
364627,halborn and tob have not been noticed in trivial mistakes yet afaik so interesting what the cause has actually been then blz link postmortem later
364628,vmihov do share your experience with realit
364629,looks to be isolated to parallels omni protocol which is in beta and not audited parallel itself is not affected
364630,
364638,1300 eth for beta
364643,yeah i agree something doesnt add up
364644,not try to sound harsh but running slither will pick up a renetancy hack not even audit worthy
364645,looking at their repo it seems like only their solidity bridge got audited not sure where the code to omni ori there solidity contracts are
364646,horrible use of logo dropping in that case really misleading
364647,
364648,those were audits parallel but omni seems to be a separate project by the parallel foundation looks like omni was audited by verdise and certik
364649,certik ftw
364650,audited just last month
364651,the fact that they still get people to pay for them is nothing short of incredible
364652,why are they so popular i seriously dont get it
364653,i too would love to know how any functioning person ends up paying certik even 1 zimbabwean dollar today
364654,lighting the money on fire or sending it to a burn address provides way more value
364655,gent need help what does this hash means
364656,
364657,lol despite everything they have a valuation of 2b and also a backing by goldman sachs ____
364658,dont think its reentrancy think the attacker tricked the omni protocol into accepting an nftx version of doodle and accounting got screwed look forward to a proper post mortem
364660,tenderly shows a better picture looks like this guy started off with 1000 eth and made off with 98k doodles
364661,somthing seems off entire collection is just 10 k
364662,lol interesting
364663,anyone going to world blockchain expo in dubai
364664,i wanted to buy ticket but want to see if anyone can help me to get discount code i heared they are partner with lobsterdao
364665,is it true
364666,ivangbi joel_john defidude
364667,hold no information unlikely to come across information will make sure to share if i find something relevant
364670,while the tweet from peckshield has alot of entertainment value i do think it opens the door for a quick copy cat attack i feel like they should have escalated to the team first
364671,they really are the worst described the exploit on revest 30 minutes after it occurred incorrectly ill add we told them that funds were still at risk and we were trying to shut down the system they removed the tweet and posted another that said taken down because funds are still at risk10 minutes later the hacker returned and had i paused token transfers 70 seconds later than i did we would have lost the remaining fundsthis was back in march for context so they really havent even tried to improve
364672,ive worked with them before and they are one of the more aggeeable audit teams but they can improve on thisimagine how much we would have lost if sam czun did this
364673,as i heard it their best guys left to form blocksec those guys are true pros showed up during our recovery to inform us of another bug in our contracts that ourselves and the hacker had missed we patched it before going live again and have been using them for audits ever since
364674,if i remember correctlysame thing happened to multichain earlier this year instead of notifying the multichain team privately peckshield had a field day calling them out on twitter as such i remember there were follow up exploits that happened shortly after but before the team could even fully address the situation
364675,how did you get that report
364676,the sheer lack of professionalism really is disgusting if you want to prove you were first publish an unlisted article with a provenance hash and share the hash imagine trading peoples financial security for imaginary internet points and calling yourself a security agency
364677,not to justify it but i dont think anyone will go looking for some provenance hash to verify that
364678,wrt greater media being first is more valuable than being correct nobody cares about retractions that come later
364679,i mean youre right but its still a shitty thing to do and it makes me as a dev less likely to use them
364680,
364681,thank you i am sure the block number is right
364682,i know this is missing a lot of the drama that you expect to read here but well its bear market so here goes a lil tool that some might find usefultldr get a grasp of a large number of accounts from multiple mnemonics in an easily if youre into python anyway extendable fashion
364683,change the i to x to generate a preview
364684,it could just be that they are misguided could possibly see someone thinking hey if we detect security flaws and post on social media before anyone else can maybe theyll be impressed and use our serviceif the product is good what you said might just be the advice they need so they dont go around pissing people off listening part would be up to them of course
364685,til thx
364686,hmmm sort of tangential but has anyone ever tried to launch a product where you can bet on volume or return ranking of different tradinginvestment firms ie oh will fund x return more than fund y this year and what not given that fund x and y are pmusing the same strategies ball park
364687,i believe it d fall into the prediction market category the known problem here would be liquidity
364688,hmmm what causes liquidity issue here exactly typically its a matter of types of products you have right if you have too niche events that not enough people care about then you dont see any interest solution there is really better sales
364689,at the core seems to boil down to a product design problem you could try to answer how do i package into a format index like product that people already know how to trade or how could i invent a new product thats easy to understand so people would trade ie kalshi pipe if you figure out 1 of the 2 then liquidity issue becomes a partnership and marketing issue getting enough people to trade and make markets cost structure and profitability issue is well technical and operational etc
364690,liquidity issue boils down to marketing issue ye not enough counterparty predictability of thereof index like product would provide more liquidity but then it s a bundle of bets i guess dont know about kalshi and pipe so not sure about these
364691,considering the people that have funded these things the issue is a lot bigger than mere marketing
364692,once you solve the product design how it works in practice and cost issue of course the biggest challenge is how you design it and thatd be the secret sauce thought by now someone must have figured out at least the design and operational issues
364693,more than a handful of projects have done all of that all the way up to having users
364694,but users for that thing is ephemeral because people dont care for predictions except in a handful of niches which are illegal andor well regulated at which point you either close up shop like some have or accept your fate as being super niche the rest
364695,issue is counterparty and buyer matchingthere is projects that solve this by having pooled liquidity but most lps wouldnt expose themselfs to a pool of unknown riskits kind of a chicken egg problempeer to peer rfq otc derivatives could solve it
364696,
364697,welp my original question was asking which projects have done those wrt to volume products investment return products
364698,i dont disagree there except predicting market volume its turning out to be pretty important for exchanges at least in the tradfi world source welp im currently one of those people doing it and lots of traders i think there are couple extraders here who can attest to this
364699,idk what if you wanna hedge your staking yield with a volume prediction maybe you know volume would be pretty high but youre not sure how concentrated itd be so you want to bet on volume separatelymaybe this is the millionth time someone has thought of this thats why im asking if anyome knows any projects whos tried it
364700,well the crypto protec investorsists are still spinning their wheels a bit so if it doesnt exist you have room to experiment for some time yet
364705,
364706,nan
364707,this isnt twitter
364708,jesus save some for the rest of us
364709,you got me well done
364713,this is not lobster wallet support group move along fuckers cheers
364714,yeah this shady lobstr wallet did something with stellar and using our naming ive also got evidence that this is a very shady project has nothing common with us but thats very sus
364715,hey guys im gathering some market data any good reports out there that talk about growing segments within crypto eg nfts gamefi or we if so would appreciate the name or link
364718,look out for any dune dashboards and onchain stats token terminal for very basic info do not look at face value gas spending contracts consistently on eth etc overall volumes
364719,
364720,new chainalysis report
364721,how much did algorand pay to be on here
364722,nan
364723,lmao theres like whole sections about a blockchain with 1mm volume made strictly by insiders
364724,will save u some time
364725,how to see older blocks and transactions etherscan does not show it all
364726,am i missing something
364727,i mean l am trying to explore older calls of tornado cash l can see only last 100 pages i want to dig more of that for that reason l am asking
364728,you can use covalents api for this
364729,or etherscan has a download csv button maybe not htere for this address idk
364730,without an api just on website can not lnvestigate
364731,l can see on ethplorer etc for ordinarry transactions but however for calls and internal trans l can not see over
364732,nansen
364733,might be able to cook something up with dune analytics
364734,l am a nansen pro user but which section to exactly gather info l need
364735,let me take this to dm to avoid spamming everyone
364736,chainalysislite
364737,damn im always late to the good stuff but thank god for lobster daily
364738,but yeah is there something oob to sponsor someones transactions
364739,ive tried biconomy opengsn defender everything is a bit err annoying
364740,hi jose we gelato provide a relay sdk that can do this feel free to dm and i can put you in touch with the devs
364741,i understand that thanks to the mechanism of collateralized debt position cdp singlecollateral dai sai was able to stay at 1 while eth crashed from 1400 to 85 in 2018 but i do not understand why the market cap of sai was increasing at that timein my mind a lot of cdp closed and it was risky to open new cdp in order to mint sai so normally the number of sai in circulation should decrease what is wrong with my logic do you know why and how the market cap of sai increased when eth creashed in 2018
364742,many ppl i know deposited their eth in maker in order to get leverage without being on a cex
364743,it was the primary use casemaker launched sai when the market already cooled down and ppl started trusting it when the bear market was already happening and the first real use case was for whoever has capital conviction to leverage on eth
364744,yep maker was one of first defi protocols people really widely used that days
364745,ah didnt know about this one these are the docs right
364746,so at that time people opened cdps even if they thought the eth might go down didnt it bother them to have a high risk of being liquidated
364747,well you pull as much dai sorry sai from the cdp as you want
364748,ill take a look if you have some demos or videos ill try to run a test tonight assuming you have it available in gnosis wanted to see how easy is to sponsor a random wallet similar to a burner wallet
364749,so you can have a really low liq price and still be slightly leveraged
364750,you decide how much youre gonna lev
364751,
364752,if you did 12x or something like you could almost not get liquidated
364753,oh yes i forgot that thanks
364754,hey rata0x dmed you
364755,yep have dmd you about this
364756,gnosis multisig should work fine for this
364757,is it ok to promoteshare our own tweets here
364759,yea shoulda just posted the meme
364760,my bad
364761,no problem ser iss okey
364762,
364763,reference too good
364764,btw all eyes on celsuis today only linksnxsteth left
364766,ecb are losing their mind 4 anti crypto fud articles released today
364767,nan
364768,reads like a forbes contributor article lol
364769,fozzysbo
364771,sorry we dont do couch legal here blz follow jake c and lexnode on twitter for legal takes
364772,and cel
364773,
364775,smh
364776,real question is who in the defi world is making friends with regulators and influencing them
364777,are there any lobby groups individuals who post an unusual number of opinions and getting attention from policymakers or crypto friendly researchers who can articulate the core benefits with very tangible examples and case study secenarios
364778,i know 3 eu crypto lobby educating meps blockchain for europe european crypto initiative l3x lexnode its a slow process original problem being that digiconomist blog and data that influenced every eu crypto law since then eu answering to our crypto data as unreliable data and lack of details for pow carbon footprint for instance
364779,i did for last two years
364780,at coe
364781,the fact that digiconomist dude has influenced anyone with his outright pseudoscience says it all
364782,hmm how does eu make regulatory decisions in the us there are some that could be done by the chairperson some that needs to be done as a group by all 5 commissioners etc just not sure how that works in the eu zone
364783,no mate you should check project titanium etc
364784,will start educating us ones after september
364785,its complex but usually you have the eu commission the eu council both executive part and the eu parliament legislative part involved then they try to reach consensus during multiple trilogue talks then you have non elected body organizations like the ecb bis faft influencing all of them and giving them recommendations travel rule for instance was a faft recommendations and its for every country in the world
364786,i dont know specifics to that but haun ventures is a vc founded by katie haun and her background is fairly relevant to your question
364787,that guy made so much harm to crypto than anyone else his studies are used by every institution
364788,its a laughable scam ive failed 1st year undergrads for better scientific reasoning
364789,i have named myself john keynez on ps5 network in hopes of gaming with one of the regulators and giving them sound inputs i havent met any of these regulators in the lobbies i game at though
364790,heres the best one letter to congress requesting the epa get involved in crypto regulation two sources both that de vries guy its like citing a food blogger for a paper in nature insane
364792,welp he does hit on all major key points that modern politics cade about now the industry has nothing to do but defendwondering what the new rhetoric would be thatd move the conversation away from defending why crypto isnt as environmentally damaging nor doesnt further the wealth gap etc
364793,more tangibly how as an industry do we shift the conversation away from the environment disparities created by blockchain to something positive and hopeful
364794,as an industry we are all aware of the benefits but what do we tell the general public and regulators to convince them at the least how do we influence enough key decision makers thatd score some major wins
364795,r u fuckers discussing esg on here now
364796,gonna literally shit on your laptops
364797,youre right
364798,lets discuss psg instead
364799,you think neymar leaving
364800,no esg just curious whos at the forefront of influencing crypto regulators
364801,hi newbie question here i would like to all pull pending tx for a given contract in real time what would be the simplestcheapest way to do so
364802,chelsea might grab him
364803,zidane to psg
364804,i am quitting
364806,a 3b silk road seizure will erase ross ulbrichts debtarticle comments
364807,wat
364808,is this the guy who larped with hells angels assasins
364809,ulbricht of course still faces life in prison he has already served eight years of that sentence at jails in new york and penitentiaries in colorado and arizona but the repayment of his restitution could mean that hes able to earn money in prison to share with family or friends without it being seized or garnished to pay his debtsor even keep any previously unknown caches of bitcoins that he may possess so long as they arent tied to the silk road or other criminal sources
364810,what a scam
364815,i agree 100
364817,like delegate to expertise
364819,removed link to selflink the convo is good and ye this seems interesting the issue is paying will be difficult because how do you access quality of a delegate in an almost deterministic way
364820,or keep rewards subjective
364824,yeah i agree
364825,can we leverage on chain data to set the expertise
364827,yeah so i think retail participation matters a lot more diversed opinions might lead to better convos around the votes
364828,so again how can we get retail participation
364830,thats the opposite of what mrkwhg meant imho retail can participate but doesnt have to governance being paid activity is weird imho but what i think is important is plurality of opinion and quality representation thats incentivization of good delegates
364833,stablenode do this exmaker delegates hoping to get paid for good governance based on predefined virtues goals
364834,only a matter of time til people start emulating the business model
364835,ah ye ok cool solid stuff then
364836,sovsignal ncerovac
364838,so how does they determine goodbad governance
364839,finally tezos time to shine d
364840,probably need to make an overseer committee within the dao that ell respect plurality of opinions but have quality control a subjective matter but if its an elected body its at least not rogue very cumbersome already the way it sounds though
364841,interesting i know that stable node has a partnership fund with polygon but am not too familiar with them other than some cursory review of their website and some of the services they provide
364842,but maybe can try it out idk i just feel it wont actually be in demand though like you dont get paid that much for it and if you do id argue a dao is overspending on miscellaneous
364843,see this for an example of their operatives
364844,thanks for sending this over will take a look
364846,i like to think of it as designing a nation different branches need checks and balances where a western skew would have a more balancedmore feedback between the checks while a more eastern would shift more power to an executive branch protocol team both are successful in their own right but to one looking at the other they see flaws
364848,ser i can see sorry if wrong you never been in a dao its fucking annoying doing 100 reporting and devs quit as soon as you make them do this shit too much
364850,hehe its combining what everyone has already built versus creating new mechanisms at the moment
364851,realt is the best platform i know of which tokenizes real estate live from 2019 already tokenized 55m of real estate some stats here they also launched an aave market where you can use the token as collateral for dai loans i am a user since early 2020
364852,does anyone have a good articleor thread comparing many aspects of app specific chains on cosmos vs supernetssubnets
364853,regarding lofty ive heard there is something fishy around their due diligence for the properties make sure you research in depth at what price they acquire and sell the properties and how they source their deals
364854,but why
364855,cause otherwise it stagnates some arguments are okay if quality
364856,y not cause us operatooors need work to do to get paid ya know
364857,create jobs man
364858,heh i see
364859,you disagree with this
364860,i fully agree
364861,State of Stake vol 70biweekly update on the pos ecosystem
364862,pretty sure they also run infra as part of their business model
364863,anyone have experience with using pyth network stream in low latency settings
364864,probably cdps sai supply it was increasing for some time showing that the market participants didnt expect saw risks of eth crashing
364865,buying the deep in a sense
364867,that was gonna happen even worse if there were managers in place in fact it was likely the issue of too many managers so no hard disagree on the root cause
364870,why should yfi holders be given anything
364873,cause they hold the pseudoequity your question is imho just gaslighting mr i would argue that just passive gibbing to holders too trivial need some governance and alignment mechanisms maybe not as harsh as vecrv but maybe stkdaave style
364874,go work for em lol
364875,who is they
364877,how are they funding operations
364878,please shorten arguments to something meaningful gaslight in dms blz
364879,lol im serious
364880,idk if id pay yfi holders seems stupid maybe in 23 years id do that but id maybe incentivise yfidai lps on dexs
364882,yfi is one of the more impressive imo in making all their operations transparent you can see all their financials here
364883,id argue that giving to people for merely holding tokens is very questionable weirdness that has been normalized but thats just me
364884,dont all the vaults lose money now
364885,or did they adjust the fees
364886,nah has been loss only yes
364887,how do mere token holders facilitate that
364888,not sure i dont hold any just think making this info transparent on chain is cool compared to the opaque nature of other daos
364889,who are the strongest meme lords on ct
364891,
364892,
364893,now that 1 usd 1 eur does anyone know if usdc has considered a temporary rebrand to being a multicurrency stable
364894,hi bruno is this your product it looks very promising
364895,when euroc in 3crv
364896,would love to give it a whirr
364897,1euroc 1usdc
364898,no a friend
364900,thanks a lot
364902,
364903,basically usdc on steroids
364904,
364905,worth a read btw f regulation regulators regulars of regulation and all the rest of the regulating bodies
364906,great thanks
364907,see above
364909,
364910,oh god
364911,ummm
364912,wat
364913,what
364914,wow fuck
364915,
364916,it would be really irresponsible to just throw it like that
364917,into twitter
364918,aaaaaa
364919,whats going on
364920,
364921,yeah
364922,
364923,surely he can just reach hayden
364924,er
364925,it transfers in some uni v3 positions
364926,at the start
364927,positions from
364929,was thinking the same
364930,is it an exploit or is it just a guy moving funds around
364931,this it
364932,someone know what happened like that can dumb it down
364933,honestly think its just a whale moving money around
364934,ive not decoded the tx
364935,why would they only hit 4295
364937,probably a whale getting scammed for their v3 nft
364938,but seems that created uniswap v3 positions with a lot of eth
364939,and the address and tx that cz is citing did a shit ton of transferfrom of that positions
364940,creation of univ3 positions
364941,transfer to cited quoted attacker
364942,if theres any hack its that guy getting their v3 positions stolen
364943,it does not seem like theres anything wrong with uniswap
364944,its limited to one user
364945,thats what it looks like to me
364946,but who knows could even be the same person that already owned the uni v3 nfts
364947,why i dont think he even has contact of him as there is absolutely 0 reasons for that
364948,dude come on biggest protocol in the ecosystem
364949,and u wouldnt try to reach him
364950,its idiotic
364951,lol what bro
364952,kek
364953,
364954,also only take 5k of eth hacking uniswap v3
364955,i dont buy it
364956,already tornadoed out not sure what cz can do to help
364957,so you think binance listing all shitcoins and keep contact with all the founders of them
364958,nah but he tweeted regarding uni being hacked in public domain where prices can fly based on a tweet
364959,if it was a real hack bad idea to alert everyone
364960,surely you cant be comparing uniswap with other shitcoins right
364961,pretty sure its not a hack
364962,yes ofc i can as its total shitcoin
364963,how much liq does eth have on uniswap
364964,5b
364965,
364966,moneys on phishing no unverified contracts in any of the remove liq transactions
364967,no one is fucking talking about their shitty token jfc
364968,why would you steal 5k eth
364969,its not a hack betting 100 usd on it kek
364970,
364971,just compromised wallet i guess
364973,
364974,cz is trying to defame a competitor basically
364975,false alarm
364976,cz is a fucking asshole if that is what his researchers are for then im worried about binances security
364977,took me 10 fucking minutes to understand it was not probably a hack
364978,peckshield is surely reliable and tornadocash is just the guy who wants anonymity
364979,maybe for cz was unusual that someone was able to withdraw liquidity without kyc and he reflectively thought about it as a hack
364980,wp cz
364981,lol our threat intel
364982,seems like a phishedcompromised wallet to me
364983,probable wanted to have a laugh and see how much money they could get shorting
364984,no doubt
364986,lol the damaged has been done already
364987,threat intel wanted to get some shorts in
364988,cz was informed by their short intel that they need to nuke uni
364989,well that was an exciting 15 minutes
364990,my dude samczsun to the rescue as well gg thanks for playing everybody
364991,its depressing to see the state of our ecosystem honestly
364992,if btc drops under 20k now thank cz
364993,its definitely not a uniswap hackhowever it does look like a phising steal imolooks like he got all his uniswap v3 vaults stolenthis imo its a flaw from uniswap v3 all the vaults should be a different nft collection to soften this kind of issues
364994,you guys has 0 knowledge in trading and it shows liquidating 300k pf oi for binance is surely worthwhile move for billionaire like cz
364995,
364997,cz is the new elon
364998,i would rather say wrapped usdc kek
364999,funds are safu
365000,whats binance and uniswaps relationship is it hostile competitive friendly
365001,peckshield v3
365002,couldve been a jab at uniswap
365003,pretty much cz fudding hes not dumb enough to think nfts getting phishing equals expliot on uniswap v3
365004,he could have messaged the uniswap team privately
365005,definitely not hostile pancakeswap is a uni fork and its the most popular gambling dapp on bsc
365006,pancake swap is v2
365007,it was more of a look at me i have the intel
365008,maybe he is mad because pancakeswap couldnt fork v3
365009,i think you dont know cz well enough
365010,also not really sure how much cz cares about bsc
365011,tax season for the win lol
365012,for this i may disagree he does seem to care about bnb and bnb is powering bsc
365013,yeah thats what im thinking as well but the word fud had to look it up learn sth new everyday
365015,
365016,possibly competitive on the exchange biz but depends on other biz units
365017,
365018,idk prob some weird relationship only insiders know in reality we can only speculate
365019,and the speculation can continue on the gated chat thats a wrap of the fun
365020,well before bsc the primary utility for bnb was lower fees on binance trading always felt like the bsc was just tacked on so they can point to it as a decentralized utility for bnb instead of actually aiming to create a viable chain
365021,bsc still remains 2nd largest used chain in crypto fyi whatever people think and it being centralized shit
365022,pancakeswap is 2nd most used dapp in crypto
365023,hum its an hypothesis i can stand behind yet i also think theres no competition as uniswaps fees are 03 while binance is at a maximum of 01 for spot
365024,yeah that casino is indeed popular people underestimate its popularity especially in africaasia
365025,yeah amms and clobs serve very different use cases technically speaking unless binance is trying to launch or already has a competing product also idk what use cases uniswap is targeting anymore seems to have changed quite a bit since v2
365026,
365027,nan
365028,its great product ui wise at the very least ux cant be good with bsc tho
365029,pancakeswap i mean
365030,bsc casino was the best ux in all of crypto imo
365031,terra
365032,they had shitcoins on there
365033,they have a competing product binance liquid swap
365034,they had luna and mir which is an idea i love but i dislike the execution
365035,
365036,didnt they have a binance dex
365038,i remember receiving email about it around early 2020
365039,guys a quick question looking at etherscan a wallet that create a project if i check the history of the transaction how is possible i can not found the first transaction in hat has founded the wallet like 10eth 0 transaction in whit a balance of 10 eth i didnt get it
365041,yes
365042,most probably funded by something like tornado cash so it will show up as internal transaction
365043,i see thanks
365044,my bad bro cz
365045,pee pee poo
365046,check the internal txs tab the wallet was probably funded by a tornado cash relayer
365047,thanks bro i will check
365048,sometimes i dont see the first transaction in internal too
365049,yeah i think its the liquid swap i used it when i first got into crypto a few times
365050,yes in this case was internal transaction tornado cashanyway i never really understood internal transaction i should check some documentation for that
365051,thanks a lot ser
365052,arbygon
365054,deleting due to partial infowill share more when possible
365056,so this is what most starkwares starkex does right a validium solution
365057,sounds reads like it
365058,notice the differencesamczsun breaks down the exploit in clear language identifying the mechanism and who is at or was at risk peckshield posts the eye emoji
365059,they have some of the guilt for that shit show
365060,no wonder uniswap is kingmeanwhile degens cmon do a fight
365061,general question but has anybody been following progress of mina protocol why seemingly wasnt there any progress made towards building a usable l1 with an ecosystem its been a year since mainnet but afaik the only activity that happens on chain is staking
365062,zksnark l1 dead on arrival
365063,general purpose private contracts havent launched yet on mina
365064,why not even if there were to launch they wouldnt be usable at scale with 1tps
365065,from what i remember they were supposed to be launched at 2021 q4 curious what if anything went wrong
365066,its a complex engineering to make those happen im quite happy with the result native recursion allowing immediately for rollup like constructions and advanced privacy snarkyjs is a good language etci just checked and its indeed still in testnet
365069,is polygon still suffering from huge blockreorgs or has it been solvedcontained
365070,
365071,evm has been the defacto smart contract runtime standard many evm compatible chains emerged to address ethereums scalability issues also given the large developer community surrounding evm many evm compatibility solutions are being built on nonevm chains to accomodate evm devs heres a comprehensive look at evm compatibility landscape
365072,hey mates
365073,can anyone guide on some futures launch process in general id better dm
365074,hi everyone my firm is looking for some sponsorship deals for a couple of newsletters crypto banter 28k daily subscribers and 40k subs for a another both have been live for about a month feel free to dm me thx

365076,is ran still in this group
365077,dmd
365078,can someone help me please to understand what is the difference between 1bps and 5 bps pools
365079,i guess is the fee tier on uniswap higher fee tier higher apy
365080,do exchanges launch a monthly contract in case it coincides a quarterly one
365085,wheres that screen from
365090,interesting whats psmknow how much is in the oasis vaults for top pairs is it significant
365091,use google u fker daniel ser
365092,hey ivangbi i wrote an article about ambire wallets marketing as i was looking into smart contract wallets marketing i have no vested interest nor any connection with ambire wallet or anyone from their teamcommunity can i share it it can be helpful for defi protocols marketing and other wallets marketing thank you in advance
365093,theres such things as wallet marketing
365094,marketing is used for any kind of product
365095,i did a content marketing analysis so it can definitely be of help for anyone developing a walletdefi project
365096,try to share blz we see then
365097,what tools do you guys use to track univ3 positions cant remember the name of that green black dashboard
365099,revert
365100,revertfinance
365101,thats the one thanks guys
365102,
365103,heres the content analysis of ambire wallets twitter page it highlights the strenghts and weaknesses and i also have some doubts regarding some abnormal engagement rates that they had for a few posts can be bots airdrop hunters or community raid let me know what you guys think and what i can improve in my content analysis framework
365104,would gladly do one for lobsterdao
365105,this is actually interesting thank u
365106,now do one for gearbox in a good light and i swear i wont ban haha
365107,i will if you promise to give me a detailed feedback so i can improve such analysis in the future
365108,easily ser
365109,next article is about gearbox then
365110,tldr
365111,lol youre fast
365112,what does 3ac have to do with starkware there is so many chapters to this drama i feel lost
365113,investors
365114,what all this text means is that there will be a starkware token
365115,the text says imho that 3ac had a call option for a fuckload of starkware tokens or it was just an equityconverttotoken warrant cant quite understand and that the liquidators missed the deadline or just did something wrong in any case if is the case a lot of the paper value can be gone due to liquidators not taking the necessary steps
365116,call option for starknet releases token he is a true degen
365117,or i misunderstand here
365118,anyway paper money poof
365119,iliquid thing
365121,im wondering from all his prorities right now hes talking about this lol
365122,isnt he on the run or something
365123,running is expensive gotta top up the run fund
365124,he did a biggest ma in cedefi
365125,
365126,they cant afford uber to court no more
365127,starkware should take the tokens that wouldve been allocated to this option and airdrop
365128,just for the media coverage shits and giggles
365129,maybe theyre tied up in a ndrangheta dungeon somewhere
365130,hey gang here is a temp group for all the lobsters coming to paris for ethcc pls join if you plan to swing by paris vi vi

365132,ofc most of people dont have tickets so anyone thats in paris during that time is more then welcome
365133,actually a lot of firms are degens in disguise
365138,the sad reality of the market
365139,apparently they say one thing and do otherwise

365193,can anyone point to good articles around security and opsec at daos or other crypto native orgs lots of great stuff out there for individuals but curious how people manage the interactions around signatures and approvals and addingremoving signers
365194,is there a way to get list of flamingo dao members cant find their token
365195,
365196,is it possible to estimate approx what is the ratio of the daily volume of arbitrage transactions made on dex like curve or uniswap
365199,farm42 is the opsec go to guy in lobster
365200,thank you

365238,
365239,minion0x i noticed that you were in paris dont forget to join the chat with the other lobsters in paris ser
365240,joined thanks
365241,nan
365245,i didnt quite understand tbh
365246,
365247,liquity good but this hurt my head is tokenbrice in this chat
365248,my 25 iq take is that this is kind of like a lossless lotteryeveryone deposits some token which the protocol deploys for some yieldthe yield amt is always going up and users can withdraw at any pt but this foregoes their yieldso the longer youre in the pool the more leveraged yield you could obtain as people leave their yield stays amplifies your own yieldbut you cant exactly make a return until the yield amt principal not sure abt this part or if you sell on secondary i guess
365249,the update
365250,i hope you like it
365252,so a game of chicken makes sense
365253,does anyone have a historical analysis of tokens when crypto projects raise additional funds
365254,
365255,if terra titan etc are any indication no manner of nice yield advertising is stopping such transient liquidity from leaving you for dead when you need it most and the biggest ones leave first
365256,resonate solves this
365257,we did this analysis for our tam calculations youre 100 spot on even normalized against the total market crash look at lido and convex
365258,this is protocol tvlmarket tvl for context
365259,anyone got a nondocsend link to the pdf apparently docsend has a vendetta against allowing you to print docs from their site
365260,ayo is alchemy down for anyone else
365261,this generates the pdf in the browser directly from memory no download
365262,dont forget about using dangerzonerocks
365263,yeah if liquidity is important to your product then you cannot depend on randoms chasing apy to be there when you need it at the very least you cannot have withdraw anytime but you lose yield so we believe maybe this stops them from leaving
365264,tfw your token is in a superposition of highly inflationary but also maybe not
365266,apart from those concerns the issue with working with yield and a cut of yield is that its not very capital efficientassuming smth like 10 apr yield rate and then some x say 10 of that underlying yield as returns to either the btkntkn lps or the protocol means youd need 100m tvl sustained for a year to get 1m in real pol
365268,yeah im not convinced the numbers actually work out especially when you consider how low yield most pol is gonna have to take a closer look to be sure though
365269,we built this graph for a slide on the discussion of what an appropriate market capitalization goal was for disruptive tech in crypto
365271,its a graph to point out that 15 is pretty easy to achieve not sure what ur hoping to prove literally dont have a horse in this race
365273,doesnt this seem like ohm but worse
365275,think the idea is ohm but better
365276,think the idea ohm but ohm
365277,seems like ohm considered this design originally but dismissed it
365278,celo is up on uniswap its green
365279,was there a governance proposal i completely missed it
365280,i think this was it or at least one stage of it
365281,lmao the votes amount ty sir
365282,frens dont let frens lose votes
365284,happy to discuss this or answer any questions took some time to go from initial temperature check to final governance proposal we were working with uniswap labs on helping define some of the standards for cross chain deployment proposal always happy to help in case others are looking to do similar proposals
365285,anyone have an idea of whos wallet this is its where the 400k steth have ended up
365286,kinda looks like an otc desk but unsure
365287,my guess it is still celsius
365288,or alameda
365289,heard 3ac bought it
365292,cz would have bought but he got some threat intel about steth
365293,icymi new issue of the state of defi lending newsletter is out covering latest news of well defi lending markets
365294,maybe its a stupid question but how decentralized is a defi protocol that heavily relies on centralized tokens
365295,its the intentional design comply with the sec by decentralising into the hands of a dao that controls everything as before
365296,what are the non compliant sec stables
365297,welp yall need to talk to crypto lawyers or at least invite one to lobsterdao im sure theyll have a field day considering theyre always looking for clients
365298,sounds sorta legal but really this might be useful
365299,were not talking about stables take a look at any low tvl l1 and see how a few accounts rubberstamp all governance props theyre owned by the team the team cant call their project decentralised if theyre openly making decisions so they do decentralisation theatre to make it seem like they are this makes it harder for regulators to call their l1 token a security
365300,met some crypto lawyers that summarized this for me gist is if this passes default regulatory body in the us would be cftc instead of the sec unless you chose to have it regulated under any of the secs regulatory offering series reg ad reg cf etc
365301,wow damn telegram trolled me thought there is a stable coin quote in the conversation
365304,what is a centralized token here
365307,i feel like theres a prob with logging in with eth address when ur wallet is on a hw device
365308,imo there should be some standard to delegate some permissions to a hot wallet or something
365309,you can do lots of programmable permissions with smart contract wallets
365310,probably best to let the contractsapp layer figure it out rather than the protocol layer
365311,yeah for sure not a protocol layer thing
365312,maybe like an ens sort of contract where anyone can register some other address that can sign for them you can limit the number of sigs a day and have a log on sn or something and kill login sessions dont see any revenue through this tho hard to fund
365313,maybe try smth like this
365314,did a quick read didnt get it
365315,
365316,i think thats where saylor is right if you keep changing ethereum every 2 months you create complexity and risk increases with complexity and thats what you want for a software company not what you want for money
365317,perhaps but is this ignorance pretending to be insight if one considers the prodding of real money people use by its managers is opaque to the populace compared to ethereum and similar where its transparent
365318,why are they drip feeding their research tho
365319,lots of crypto lawyers lurking here i think ivangbi and mods get a bit tired of armchair lobster lawyers so i tend not to respond much for the best really there are plenty of other channels for these topics
365320,
365321,could we form a lobsterpac
365322,
365323,celsius
365324,quebec pension fund invested in it
365325,probably why the tcad
365326,looking quick they made a good 600k in interest
365327,lmao
365328,lolthe only stables we permit are those we can control yes this is good for you and crypto because reasons
365330,tin foil hat would say luna is a insider job
365331,would love some suggestions hopefully something more efficient than paying hundredshrs for advice or buying them a beer
365333,sorry but anyone know why i cant revoke here
365334,nan
365335,wallet connected
365337,thx but this is for eth
365338,try unrekt
365340,usdt is one for example
365341,well is the contracttether has the ability at any time time and for any reason to pause the token blacklist any address delete the balance of any blacklisted addressso if what you have is heavily reliant on usdt then well it is evidently at the mercy of tether and whoever can coerce them
365342,mate i know how usdt works ahaha my question was different
365346,you asked a rhetoric question it wasnt incorrect i just dunno what answer you expect to get que pasa
365347,would such a thing be decentralized if it really is heavily reliant on usdt then no i dont see how itd fitit can certainly be completely automated a la liquityuniswap and useful with no human management required but not decentralized
365349,so its correct to say that no defi protocol is decentralized especially those with high influx of centralized stables right i mean at any time any lp can be blocked centrally from the issuer is this correctexcept for dai maybe
365350,no dont pervert coiners words what he said was correct what you are saying is a weird notnecessary remix
365352,also are you amber heards lawyer why fucking rewrite essentially the same to ask is this correct sir yes is bloody correct is literally above
365353,why are you that salty i am just trying to come to a conclusion
365354,because you are doing mental gymnastics and thats annoying lol also i had no coffee yet and my bags are down rekt aaaa eat my poop ser
365356,the protocol can be decentralized while still having centralized assets in collateral cases lending and stables not really per se though because often risks are bundled into a unified pool there but in cases of trading or other things where a protocol does not hold such assets itself in any way and only users choose then it can be fully decentralized
365358,there are defi protocols that arent heavily reliant on fiatcoins dai is not one or them today its mostly wrapped usdc similarly designed fiatcoins and asset wrappers wbtc and their new treasury thingamajigs liquity however is a quintessential example of one with exactly 0 reliance on a fiatcoin uniswapv2 and v3 are others though im certainly curious what would happen to their routing if they got frozen
365360,i think the whole point of 3acs tweet or rather their lawyers tweet is to point to 3 aka liquidators so incompetent that missed out on value that could have been used to pay off creditors one thing for sure their lawyers are quite good so better chances theyll walk unscathed for the next scam
365361,i really wonder if they considered that neither v2 nor v3 have a reliance on fiatcoins unlike say curve but its all for naught if you can effectively shut it down with a welltargeted blacklisting
365363,nan
365365,lol of course freewayfi is a scam theyre not even shy about it as mlm ponzi is all over their wp it was heavily pushed by ct shitfluencers through with the affiliate links just waiting with for this to collapse
365366,wasnt in my bubble please shame some of the accounts that we might know but that are actually scammers
365367,true pristine as lusd is its virtually unused
365368,still crying to this day tbh
365369,those that havent deleted tweets are still there with freewayfi and fwt tags their affiliate scamgame is stronk affiliates get to up their apy withdrawals paid from new deposits etc ponzi101
365370,its too good for its own good lol cant advertise uncertainty that would speculation when youre complete from day 1 and since its immutable the apparent oversight cannot be fixed
365371,570k vs 1b well at least its useful for future experiments to learn what not to overlook
365372,alameda buys aave calls from ribbon buys celsuis steth deposits into aave mints gho buys lobs
365373,look at curve pools though but ye is worse there ofc
365374,hypocrisy judge denies sec motion to keep hinman docs secret in ripple casethe sec has argued that the documents should be protected because hinman wrote the speech as a personal errand but the judge didnt buy it
365375,not a fan of ripple but lolthe hypocrisy in arguing to the court on the one hand that the speech is not relevant to the markets understanding of how or whether the sec will regulate cryptocurrency and on the other hand that hinman sought and obtained legal advice from sec counsel in drafting his speech suggests that the sec is adopting its litigation positions to further its desired goal and not out of a faithful allegiance to the law
365376,hello everyone great to meet everyone here im nick a community manager for bebop a new defi protocol with multitoken swaps 0 slippage features on eth and incubated by wintermute
365377,layer 1 blockchain sei network incentivized testnet is set to go live on 071120221 of the total sei supply will be allocated to rewarding those who participate
365378,validator registration form seems be closedis there anyone participate in
365379,and aptos blockchain tier 2 has closed too
365380,sei sui whats up with the recent names for chains
365381,creativity gone
365384,just spam
365386,oh these two are different
365387,hey allheres a list of defi mentors from india who have founded web3 companies
365388,i went ahead and invested a small amount in a property on lofty to test it out ill keep that in mind tho
365389,global regulators back same risk same regulation for stablecoins reutrs3ixmzhi
365390,gm is there a tg bot that tracks whenever a twitter account has followed someone
365391,try twint on github
365392,i never knew twint did that twint scrape existing data it doesnt notify about new follows no
365394,there is a drop analytics bot but i wont share got banned off the nft group because of sharing the tg
365404,not one that you can customize but there are a few that track influencers there is a list here on my compendium of all kinds of tg bots
365405,
365408,join nft gated chat please
365409,links in the description
365410,you left out rahemanali he fully deserves to be on that list
365411,thank you for letting us know feel free to comment on that thread with whoever you think is great
365414,im a cryptolawyer but not always looking for clients
365416,
365417,lol wtf
365418,cpi yoy 91est 88
365419,nan
365420,nan
365421,wew
365422,mom is 13 i think the expected is 11
365423,
365424,nan
365425,my mom does a 100 stop lying
365426,
365427,can someone explain this cpi thing in simple terms or send a link i see so many people expecting this then it comes and then we go to goblin town
365428,but ehm what do these numbers represent something with inflation i guess
365429,government measure of the cost of consumer goods
365430,
365431,im an idiot but thats how its been explained to me
365432,coin bureau can be a little grating but its important to understand the criticisms of the cpi too
365433,thanks also thanks petermm for the link
365438,came in higher than expected
365439,lefterisjp this is a good thread by a respected economist
365440,
365442,outside of crypto people react to below 1 changes so cpi coming in a little bit higher was quite bad
365443,what do you mean saying the 005 will naturally have lower volume as it only comes from volatilityand why it also needs 5x less volume for the same aprcould you clarify this please
365444,revokefinance is op because i made it
365445,its not a competition and if it was revoke cash is still better
365447,
365448,0050015 that is the logic i guess
365449,later starknet fees will be paid only in this token while ensuring good user experience for users interested in paying fees in eth
365450,rip starknet
365451,muh decentralizationwe have minted an initial ten billion tokens which are being allocated to core contributors of the starknet ecosystem including starkware and starkwares investors to starknet software developer partners and to the foundation
365452,
365453,what do i think about network states
365454,anyone had a chance to read this yet network states i mean not the blog
365455,first chapter in seems interesting to me i like that he really breaks it down in a sentence then a paragraph then 1000 words i did a political science degree and this is by far the most comprehensible work of political idealism ive come across try reading leviathan das kapital etc and tell me what you think though this is likely because im a contemporary and i get the context will update when i finish it
365456,as for the premise itself i see problems in existing states seceding sovereign territory to a network state but im not necessarily the target demographic here i am relatively content with how my state functions
365457,especially when so many other breakaway states eg south ossetia transinistria struggle so much getting un recognition a network state will likely not fair this any better indeed without a military it might go nowhere at all though balaji doesnt advocate for state creation via war
365458,too couch legal im not sure either way very interesting book go buy it
365459,but then to counter this the vatican gets to be a part of the un and vote on certain things because its a part of the in crowd maybe a network state could pull this one off too
365460,for the nomads here
365461,what if i just travel without sharing my rekt experience from web3 im no longer a nomad sad
365462,legitimately couldnt image anything worse than being unable to escape dinner with a bunch of biz dev ppl no matter where i am globally get this shitty nft project outta here
365463,hi all i am the founder of a web3 project yet to launch i am building up the numbers for the 12 month forecast burn as reference to set the pre seed funding target is there an experienced founder willing to have a one to one meeting sharing tips and tricks and plausible figures from your experience
365464,first target at least 18 months of runaway as there is carnage out there thats coming in the future depends on a product potential market current team etc btw if this is pre seed some bigger ecosystems have grants programs etc which are non trivial obviously not enough to compare to a pre seed raise dms are open for discussion but we can maybe also keep it here
365465,looks like the private clubs memberships start ups that popped up end early 2010
365466,do you guys have favorite crypto price websites looking for an alternative to cryptowatch
365467,excel use api to pull data in
365468,
365469,
365470,
365473,theres quite a few listed here on my compendium if you want to take a look
365474,huge potential privacy problem with eth merge if it proceeds without a solution
365475,my portfolio will be pissed if scbuergel managed to mess up the merge timing again
365476,am i missing something this doesnt seem new or all that bad also lol at this reply
365477,on synthetics what pros and cons would you highlight for various platforms that can synthesize any asset given a price feedie which synthetics system tends to stay true to asset prices with the lowest required lp per asset ie mirror synthetics etc
365478,thoughts on the implications
365479,fortunately civic is irrelevant
365481,sounds like just kyc without any privacy actually may be compliant
365482,wait civic is still around isnt vinny back to be a maxi
365483,he is no longer ceo last i saw he was shilling doge though maybe he has moved on from that
365489,
365492,nan
365496,lol
365500,dont cel customers recv yields too
365501,hmm is that a sly nod towards pulling a solendjuno on celsius
365502,i guess u can say close enough dont think its right for them to do this unless celcius customers return their yield they recv too
365503,rightful ownersall the storytelling and emotional blackmail in the world doesnt change ownership of it from celsius but hes got emotions on his side
365504,funny thread
365505,same people that were calling out solend and juno waffling about but iz ponzi therefore we maybe justifyed in doing same ting
365506,i dont even get how crypto went from the poster child of libertarianism to anybody can take over the ownership of someones tokens because of the greater good
365507,nan
365508,money ser money
365509,
365510,still one would think that it would be a taboo subject nowadays it seems like the first option thats brought up as soon shit hits the fan
365511,it used to be a taboo subject but then the compromises for insert excuse started happening with little to no significant push back and here we arerecreating fintech one compromise at a time now with 100 more brockshane
365512,i think its right around the time people started saying crypto is about insert feel good things that have nothing to do with crypto and then decided to use those feel good things to rationalize any and every shitty thing possible
365513,honestly if a dao can randomly decide to redistribute tokens they should atleast own a few tanks would make it more palatable
365514,bullish on dao that can back token with military force
365515,panzer dao
365516,wheres the real inflation
365517,its 500 as per cz
365518,theyd prob want to under report it when inflation is high prob to not deter consumer spending too much while getting them ready for the realityim looking at bureau of labor statistics site and cant find the raw data they used to calculate cpi only aggregate data per category of goods and services
365519,ie over the last couple months or so i ended up paying 1012 more on my expenses instead of 78 figure on the cpi might just be that what i buy is heavily exposed to the right tail goods but thats the real inflation that i personally feelbut most americans are terrible with finances so if theyre looking at any figure its gonna be the cpi figure sets expectations for how they should behave
365520,what is this zimbabwe weimar germany
365521,read the coindesk article and it seems like of they pay off their debt they can liquidate 100mil worth of btc collateral they put in
365524,i thought id share a brief summary of what took place in ocean protocolhope it helps summarize whats going onthis event just made us put our heads down and work harderlooking forward to us shipping veocean and all related updates
365525,but cpi is what most consumers feel its usually slightly under reported when high cuz rational expectations
365528,i think its preferred they under report it you dont want people getting scared en masse and reducing total spending thatd be really catastrophic its meant to control expectations
365531,id generally stay away from pessimistic talks like thatperception of the economy actually impacts the real economy and you can get a selffulfilling prophecy situation pretty easily
365532,inflation is not rate of increase in money supply its relative to economic output not saying cpi is a correct metrics to measure whats happening just by definition 500 inflation is not the right assumption
365560,why are we talking about mmt lets just talk about cpi and what does it mean for the crypto and defi world
365563,currency is meant to be a unit of account for a society to more easily exchange goods and services examined from another point of view currency is just a unit that represents in some fashion all parts of the economy accounted for within this unit bitcoin can never be that youd need some sort of basket representing as many goods as possible or at a hyperscaled economy it might closely resemble energybitcoin will as time moves forward lose relevance because it will be outcompeted by things that more accurately represent itself as a unit of the economy measuring anything against btc is kind of odd as btc moves sometimes 5 per daysupply of money increasing or decreasing wont be a bad or good thing forever we will see a time when currency increasing in supply just shows that the total sum of all value of the economy is increasing
365564,welpcpi is something but we should focus on the fact that supply has gone up by x not impact why focus on mere supply increasesupply and demand but youre only focusing on supply abovesomething about btc and mmtnaisu
365566,so what are you suggesting exactly
365569,is there any data to back this curious to see how much debt is out there
365570,if only there were projects that were working on a solution to this fiat problem
365571,in a few re groups and they all pretty levied up but they all look like they are in good positions
365572,whats the problem
365574,its not a problem its part of the cycle ray dalio outlined it video helped me understand it alot
365576,i think the technology that will exist and be prolific within 10 years will allow currencies to be looked at in a different way than they are now perhaps the usd will still be around but currency that is redeemable for hard assets is going to be a big leap forward
365577,if currency represents units of the economy bundled together and weighted appropriately you dont really need any sort of cycle you just switch out the components
365578,this is pretty interesting
365579,watching
365580,im not sure how it would work because currencies have value because governments defend it ik the bullcase for btc but what would make top countries with power to use the currency
365582,well they dont need to use it they can create it on their own say if it were a platform
365584,no one is going to use btc its a failure
365586,the best thing to do is to find out why no one uses it and try to build a better productcurrency
365587,btc is successful in its own conditions i use it for transactions
365588,thats a pretty bad statement considering no one uses it already
365590,yes but normal people do not
365591,i would consider myself normal
365592,i am triggered beyond belief
365593,there are projects out there that claim to be able to use zero knowledge swaps through the use of multi party computation facilitators that will help btc become a more viable mechanism for payments due to increased privacy
365594,ill give you guys a hint the composable system of economic good and services etc is going to exist very soon the rails to distribute these new tokens that are created on this platform already exist i cant tell you what it is because ill be called a shill but im super excited for the future of currencies
365595,yet if you hold btc for greater than 0 time you expose yourself to its volatility
365596,so uh no thanks
365597,welp thats certainly your opinion interest rate hike triggered markets falling not caused it to be more precise typically people start to scrutinize the valuations when interest rate goes up
365599,bro you prove my point something 20xed and you want people to willingly give it up to buy coffee or to make their car payments
365603,mr stands for something i think
365604,what prevents people from using it as a payment system now
365606,lack of privacy confirmation time cost vendors willing to accept it
365607,among other things
365611,what how can you engineer the price of btc to be more stable building on top of instability is questionable
365614,raising interest rates is a way to reduce the demand for finished goods and services such as automobiles and appliances if the world economy is growing very rapidly i dont believe raising interest rates will prove to sustainable if the problem is an inadequate supply of finished goods and services due to broken supply lines and low wages for workers then raising interest rates is the wrong course of action it will cause even fewer automobiles and appliances to be made it will cause many current workers to be laid off such an approach when the world is trying to deal with too few workers will tend to make the situation worse rather than better and the solution lower interest rates more stimulus checks higher inflation
365616,so loss of confidence in fiat
365618,got around to writing a quick tldr if anyones still interested not quite a lossless lottery more a reflexive leveraged yield token mechanism where the amount of leverage you can accumulate depends on how many new participants come in its a bit more complicated cuz the btoken accrual mechanism is weird but im pretty sure i got the jist
365620,holy crap yeah im going to bed the mr can reign tonight
365621,hmmm what are the privacy and cost issuestechnically lightning network solves time issue right and vendors issue is sth that a non business entity or a well capitalized entity wont have to worry about they can purely focus on the building part a d take their timenot a btc maxi just trying to understand and learn more
365622,i was referring to btc in general not lightning
365623,hmm yeah maybe thats the confusion im just talking about the underlying transaction and payments infrastructure not the coin
365624,those are completely irrelevant compared to the volatility
365625,that same mpc protocol i referred to can and is being built on top of lightning so the cost and transaction finality would be mitigated
365626,john doe doesnt care about privacy they will gladly get chipped in order to be able to pay with a wink
365627,time adoption and utility will solve that assuming adoption takes place
365628,time is not going to do that thing any favors
365629,but it will certainly be interesting to see if the maxis stick by their only 21m storytelling when the reality of increasing insecurity is no longer so trivial to ignore
365631,wen in bear opt to raise more at lower val even if it means down round ideally have a runway extending beyond 24 months or whatever your expectation for the bear is integrate cost cuts scenarios
365632,until btc figures out its economic sustainability issues its no better than fiat or a slow ustlike softrug like you mentioned
365634,i dont see any attempts within btc community even to acknowledge the issue and discuss it
365649,mrkwhg keeps fucking having macro battles with 100 messages and advocating for the fall of the world etc permaban the person didnt listen to multiple warnings literally 3
365650,by accident deleted all their msgs oops well it was time literal flood of blabla
365651,coine_r dont gaslight randoms
365652,transnistria is not a breakaway state like catalunia for example its a fabrication of the russian foreign politic meant to strategically serve their interests of power holding in the region
365653,
365654,it seems it is better to go bankrupt and jailed than pay these fees jfc
365655,on tracerdao is this true of gmx too
365656,but i do ser fk chips not touching that shait
365660,ser celsius and voyager customers will effectively be paying these firms as adviser fees come out of the estate first
365662,
365663,joseph being edgy as always idk
365664,nan
365665,nan
365666,what r ur thoughts on this experiment by scott number 165 if i remember correctly idk i am a negative pleb
365667,why am i tagged there i am not sure i personally dont have any info on canto to be able to infer an opinion
365668,no clue maybe due to u being vocal
365670,you are negative because phone need charge
365671,
365672,alliance dao first raised 50m and now printing out shitcoins in prepreseed rounds or what is the model
365675,worth scrolling through projects though
365676,this is hilarious they accepted few more lending protocols exchanges even nft wallet but they decided to pass on humanode without any explanation half a year ago seems like these guys have no imagination at all i do not see any of those on the list becoming multibillion protocols
365677,why the general negative view on tokenized incubators for web3 startups
365679,imho its usually netnegative to be in an incubator in crypto vs hackathons gitcoin things and simply being open to community from day 0
365680,unless the founding team has literally 0 experience in crypto and need hand holding
365681,and they dont have a few weeks to spend in chats and see what is happening themselves
365682,in which case wtf u doing here kids get ur hands dirty first
365683,actually they are not like techstars or other accelerators you can go through alliance and do not even give them x of total token supply just talk to them go to demo day and go away with a mention in tc
365684,oh so freeride whats their gain then ur logo
365685,i think both in web3 and traditional the value is in the connections you get by taking part in such sometimes useless programs rather than trying to fight for some donations on gitcoin or raise money or create hype
365686,sometimes they invest but if the founder does not let them they wont insist
365687,unless you are a weird web2 startup usually and u go for outlier ventures who for a huge sum of 510 do a lot of stuff afaik or at least used to but i would never even call those startups crypto or defi related mostly very weird choices from small slow eu teams
365688,ye but crypto is all open if you spend a bit of time you can get a niche audience
365689,memes pron gifs research etc in tradfi this seems to be harder
365690,given the community are not investors there actually
365691,should include pron gifs in our marketing strategy
365692,shocker geth is 214x slower than erigon
365693,whats the bottleneck
365694,i think geth has worse indexes for logs or maybe doesnt have them at all
365697,twitter is down
365698,all over the world
365704,no use a vpn set to japan and you can still access twitter
365705,can confirm just did and it worked
365706,thanks
365707,why delet oo
365708,been using erigon for all our logs recently and caching requests on our infra as logs we do generally arent one time and pretty fast
365709,it just got upset elon didnt buy in
365710,cause also checked and it was down
365711,gm friends does anybody know alternatives to degenscore is there any opensource discussion about address scoring
365712,the only problem with open source for this kind of a thing is that it lets people optimize to meet the criteria
365713,the above screenshot is the result of a 403 error sent by the api if twitter page loaded at all but the content did not show with the above ui it was 403 error they seemed to have a little bit of an auth issue
365714,where can i find historic price data across all major exchangesrequirement is i need to know everytime the price has changed and timestamp on when the change happened
365715,yep but when algorithm is closed some will be able to reverseengineer it and when its open and community sees some top score profiles community will be able to make a proposal to update formulas accordingly
365716,truethis is usually the part of the conversation where a dao taking requests for adding projects comes in then it actually being monetized is next imho pay to be degen
365717,i am really not buying the public good experiment arguments fork it all into one new chain print 50 new tokens muh experiment nah
365718,yep but also when its opensourced anyone will be able to fork it and set his own priorities in the scoring code im convincied that its impossible to make single fair scoring system unless youre not in black mirror or china so would love to learn about existing approaches before throw my version of it
365719,you have showkarmaxyz
365720,for the score approach
365721,its a cosmos thing isnt itscrolls downyup yup it isyou can sell this lie canto is to be an unowned entity that can provide nonrent extractive defi primitives as a public service of the chain when you and your friends control all the validators remember raiblocksnano the free txs chain
365722,try that in an actually decentralized setting and see how far you get
365723,looks quite raw thoits more about reputation inside dao not overall onchain reputation of address as degenscore
365724,ethrankio
365725,there is more info here
365726,wow thanks
365727,what drop analytics bot do you mean
365728,score 450 not badbut i dont want to see how much i spent on fees anymore
365730,go watch lobsters how u ll get rugged
365731,nice wavy hair ivan
365732,anyone know why theres such a drop in ethereum nodes
365733,looks like etherscan glitch look at also
365734,did ivangbi say a word in the coingecko conference kek ive been watching and i didnt hear him say a single thing
365735,lol
365736,everything acted as we expected in defi solend was going to crash solana because of a whales liquidation
365738,i did every round of questions did but they were normal not edgy and pre3ac recorded
365739,i joined when they last spoke about stablecoins and then switched to serum wait ivan how are you answering this you are currently talking at the same time this is another level of multitask
365740,trade offeri get your participation in the lobster chatyou get personal satisfaction
365741,this is not me this is fake deepfake
365742,i genuinely wanted to chat in the conference chat just disappointed about the quality of the messages in the open chat i guess ill probably just listen and keep my questions for later
365743,btw thats a risk that not only applies to solend but any kind of liquidationcentered lendingborrowing protocol where depending on the lender composition there similarly could be significant concentration risk with correspondingly concentrated high value liquidation trigger points
365744,anyone looking to sell their ticket for ethcc
365745,my friend has 2 tickets but is it possible to transfer their ownership they claim they check ids on the entrance anyway feel free to dm
365746,please do this in paris eth cc chat
365747,agreed
365748,or we become the ethcc scalper nft marketplace
365749,feds waller decentralized finance could end up transforming traditional financial markets
365750,wow who would have thought
365751,feds waller we didnt handle things right at the fed from a risk management point of view
365754,hey frens whats the right way to query some contract data at a certain block height given an acrhive node like using ethersjs
365755,
365757,
365758,thanks
365759,hi does anyone know of any protocols that integrated ve with gnosis delegation registry
365760,as a meta question if anyone is keeping a list of protocols that are integrating building on top of or forking crv contracts ie cvx i would love to spelunk that listthank you
365763,anyone recommend a browser based proxy so i can use polymarket
365764,
365765,its on a pdf so it must be true
365766,this is a bit middleofthebell curve skepticism
365767,lmao
365768,boolish narrative id think
365769,sec weighs waiving some rules to regulate crypto gensler says link archive
365770,11d chess reverse psychology regulation
365771,maybe he realized eos his investments also fall in the same categories of regulation
365775,with tradfi yields being higher than defi usdc holders might at some point ask for some interest revenue split heh
365776,think offering retail yield requires bank charter approval first havent heard any updates there for a while
365777,link to this chat

365784,
365785,06b of that is worthless cel tokens
365786,thats probably why sbf or someone said they had a 2 billion dollar hole
365787,not quite worthless yet
365788,so this means they didnt otc their steth or wbtc since they still have 17 billion of crypto assets or various others uni snx etc
365789,the amount of fail in this company is breathtaking
365790,it is interesting how much they seem to harp on covid
365791,quick q can all ownerssigners be removed from a gnosis safe documentation isnt helping at all
365792,leaving the safe with simply the reality module to move assets
365793,can u elaborate a use case for this
365794,activate reality module and then remove all signers so we essentially have our treasury 100 controlled by onchain voting
365795,this is to prevent a full migration to a nounslike token that has native onchain gov
365796,nouns is a comp fork
365797,does anyone know how to deal with the steth 1 wei edge case in solidity
365798,the what
365799,nan
365800,so if you wanted to send 1 whole steth to a defi vault or something you would end up with a 1 wei roundoff error and end up with less than you thought you should
365801,
365802,300mil in cel that they probably cant liquidate without crashing hard
365803,this is why alameda is performing squeezes on cel

365806,id love an explanation of how a token for a company that is down over a billion dollars is worth 600m
365807,magic of owning a shitcoin contracts
365808,when you start seeing beleaguered in the copy talking about your company you should be looking for the exits
365809,what its worth on paper i guess
365810,
365811,nan
365812,huh
365813,oh jesus you know its bad when the lender loses the collateral they are michael jordan of taking ls
365814,158m tis but a scratch
365815,stagflation
365816,avoided luna but still lost over a billion of users funds thats a skill
365818,why is nexo opening an account on exchange in the first place cant they get a normal account
365819,send it to 0x0 decrease supply for the greater good
365820,anyone know what happened to hoo looks like they gone

365832,yeah i know strange liability to take on though
365833,dark forest maybe
365834,as long as there is no lps on those contracts then they are kinda gucci i guess worst case scenario their product dont work anymore just guessing didnt read whole contract
365835,knowing alabamas modus operandi its quite possible
365836,its worth that much until sbf hasnt finished unloading his bags theyre quite effective in their altruism
365837,wow lovely overnight factual discussions what a delight to read
365838,
365839,
365840,godtier
365841,does anyone have any insight on farcaster or lenslenster ecosystem do you think decentralized social media will finally stick
365842,crypto people dont know how to make social media networks lol
365843,not yet
365844,its been attempted by crypto devs for years it just doesnt work
365845,they cant make a social media thats not text based cuz thats all they do
365846,meanwhile kids are venturing off text focused more and more
365847,all about visuals visuals visuals
365848,if they cant accept that its doa
365849,gives control back to creators lol they dont want control they want fans
365850,you guys remember dan larimer right
365851,dude spent like 9 figs on voicecom calling it a twitter competitor lol and what happened
365853,cant disagree at all crypto people are weird nerds and they miss what social networks normal people stuff need
365854,and when crypto founders try to hire normal people to vibe with other people
365855,theyre out of touch with kids
365856,it becomes the most cringy shit on the planet
365857,and kids determine what social media platform takes off
365859,its just not something crypto devs will ever comprehend cuz all they know is what they know in their bubble
365860,dan larimer thought it was a good idea to mandate kyc for every user and pretty much alienate anyone under 16 on voicecom
365861,lmfao
365862,dead on arrival
365863,rekt all good points though
365864,the now and the future of social media is visual
365865,not text based
365866,twitter is a boomer app a lot of people that go viral on tiktok pay little to no attention to twitter
365867,text focused is dead
365868,speaking facts
365869,actually now i am surprised how did zuck a fking reptile make facebook
365870,eduardo was the sociable one
365871,zuck was the tech guy
365872,eduardo was in touch guy
365873,with the money
365874,true
365875,even looking at lens now its just crypto people in it lol
365876,publications control back to creators the last social network you need lmao
365877,where do kids go viral on this
365878,nan
365879,oh god its text based lmao
365881,paying people to post lol
365882,lol
365883,this is literally voicecom all over again lmao
365884,so you mint a profile on lens
365885,then lenster is the social app built on it
365886,theyre trying to remake twitter but decentralized lol
365887,yeah looks like aave hired a couple people from twitter
365888,kids dont got time to write essays for posts
365889,this is voicecom all over again
365890,same exact platform
365891,same exact crowd
365892,i think lens is more of a twitterposting for techies really not intended as tiktok
365893,so its not gonna take off only amongst their circle
365894,if theres no viral factor whats the point
365895,just make a tg group its free lol
365896,tbh personally i felt that so far the socialfi project in crypto space still have not catch up users mindset and eyeballs
365897,as you saiddecentralization would not be a sale point for general users and we still need other userfriendly services and incentive sharing mechanism
365898,boomers trying to stay relevant lol
365899,no one gives a shit unless youre already part of their circle
365900,kids determine what social network takes off not adults
365901,no way to make general users to get rmb the 12 seed phases just for a new twitter account
365902,and lens basically made a social network that appeals to themselves and zero interest to kids lol
365903,how to make kids addicated with the crypto element would be an interesting topic
365904,the pay to post narrative is tricky
365905,kids arent motivated by money theyre motivated by clout
365906,dev alfa fresh off the commit write vyper contract in one cell debug in the next cell
365907,again creators dont want control they want fans lol
365908,kids wont get addicted to text based media
365909,gotta be visual
365910,and its hard to monetize viral thru the actual social network
365911,kids go viral then just put dm for inquiries in their bio
365912,and handle biz themselves
365914,agree with you point
365915,in that casewhat would be the native advantage for social network projects running on web3
365916,from stanithey thought that social graph can be an asset owned by user themselves to monetize from any socail network application who would like to get those social graphs
365917,but it seems not very easy to build such new system and new kinds of biz model with huge scale in short term
365918,you can raise at higher valuation
365919,s but not really s
365920,
365921,lmfao true tho
365922,none lol
365923,reality every social network needs some kind of centralization
365924,some form of moderation
365925,thats why theyre paying for users since theyre behind
365926,voicecom tried the same thing
365927,pay people to post so they can join
365928,but kids arent motivated by making money they want the clout
365933,they wanna be viral and theyll go on the social media platform that can get them that
365934,thats true when bull lol
365935,a museum dao raised 10m just a few days ago idk what ur talking abt
365936,yeahwould be more effective for management
365937,like lobsterdao chat yes
365938,ok anyway points taken good good no need to reminiscence more 3
365939,lens fell for the decentralize twitter meme and believed it
365940,yes good discussion
365941,omg you win lmao
365942,yeah thanks for guys sharing your insight
365949,this merge timeline isnt final but its extremely exciting to see it coming together please regard this as a planning timeline and look out for official announcements
365950,what are the best gnosis safe alternatives for a multisig usable by daos and protocols
365951,its peepeth not voice
365952,voice was more like steemit 20 the rest is more or less accurate
365953,if youre selling your twitterinsert social media alternative and the first words out of your mouth includes decentralized then its dead before it hits the ground unless you are of course content with niche usage the kind of people that care about decentralization are an insignificant portion of twitter and friends userbase
365954,theyre an insignificant portion of the crypto culture let alone twitter and friends userbase
365955,society is a product of a centralized government so a decentralized social media makes no sense
365956,ok all points taken lets not beat around the same bush reconfirming the statements
365957,
365958,lol the confidence
365959,3ac liquidators petition singapore court to recognize bvi straits times
365961,they had the wong partnership
365962,im not paying 1000 for that
365966,nan
365967,delphi pro for 1 eurodollar per month
365968,we lost so much money bro please buy subscription discount 9999 now only for 1 please bro buy sub its valuable we are not going to shill luna alike ponzi again we promise bro buy sub bro we need it to survive
365969,they been selling their sub for 10k last year where they shilled an absolute ponzis they should be insolvent and deserve public shame
365971,why am i getting ptsd from such projects and threads
365972,dunno ive only seen 55 influencers talk about it in the last 5 days
365973,but a16z invested
365974,oh ye the new layer 1 with new language oh yes fuck lets go no
365975,its getting one per minuteimpressive speed of reactions
365976,a16z is top 10 crypto villains spray and pray into shit projects
365977,but it is better than all chains you have ever seen
365978,great discussion w liquity dev thanks for sharing
365979,a16z team member in this chat who invested at 99999b valuation____________fck cant add gifs here finish this meme by yourself
365980,nan
365981,there is no one from a16z here
365982,and it shows
365983,thanks ser
365984,you need someone to just throw money around like a clown
365985,why would they choose to lock in gas price every 24 hours it sounds like a disaster where youre stuck for the entire duration with either too much traffic or sky high fees
365986,adoption i guess
365987,they have had some great successes though timely exit on coinbase too
365988,but they bought maker dao in 2017
365989,they have a good taste than us
365990,they threw money around for fun last cycle for every coinbase they had about 100 duds but all you need is a few winners to drastically outperform the losers
365992,true but then again having 28bn aum to invest is not an easy task except maybe if youre renaissance technologies then you can also manage 130bn and still consistently and crazily outperform every chad
365993,renaissance
365994,renaissance founder is a superhuman that is the different
365995,they only raised 1b at 100b fdv bullish
365996,ethkiller narrative never dies
365997,every ss we all have it
365998,yeah big time after pushing a bit of giga brain math he just goes earning some billions why not
365999,every russian knows a response to a blockchain named sui
366000,what are the best block explorers to use with evm forks
366001,simply ask the central operator for an excel sheet
366002,tryethernalcomalso try otterscan tenderlyco
366003,how many among the duds did they exit out on a profit a16z is pretty good at timely exits no thought their strong suit is riding the market wave as opposed to funds like sequoia being mostly value driven
366004,cant help the degen in themselves but they always got tokens already listed projects at significant discounts to market too should still be rekt on ygg etc
366005,its like the chicken and the egg did the first vc dumper exit timely or start the downfall of the price
366006,dont agree if there ever was good fundamental value then some investors wouldve stayed new ones wouldve come in to get a bargain
366007,yeah im not denying they arent good at what they do i just tell people to take it with a grain of salt if they see a project is backed by a16z
366008,but seriously im actually interested in seeing roi data per asset for vcs idk if crunchbase or other sources have that info anyone know a good source
366009,you dont have to agree you can probably just check their investments and sell orders and see exactly what i am talking about
366010,equitiesfirst owes crypto lender celsius 439 million financial times

366013,
366014,they havent exited outright all this means is an exit event happened no andreessens still on the board so they have a sizable stake
366015,nan
366016,i dont trust his egg shaped head
366017,bald fraud
366018,but you buy his bags
366019,lol its the 1 million dollars gif
366020,good idea for my pack
366021,reminds me of a young baron harkonnen
366022,they bought fwb at 100
366023,down bad
366024,well they can afford it
366025,
366026,disclosure marc andreessen is an investor in business insider
366027,ayy lmaooo
366028,wrapped solana on ethereum seems not wrapped from
366029,report claims 23 of mixer transactions are illicit on tornado the 100 eth market has a anonymised set of about 20k which means about 5k are illicit i assume any large exchange would just reject any deposit associated with the 100eth pool kind of making tornado a bit pointless for illicit players
366030,true edgar shows they exited about 50 at 5bn which they returned to their lps other half of current 14 million share is 750 million or 625 coin is now 12 bn mcap
366032,nan
366033,individual users are starting to file stuff with the court
366034,tfw you give some crypto thing your life savings
366035,do mixers like tornado work with nfts too are they any nft mixer tools
366036,its not possible to mix an nft since theyre non fungible by definition
366037,how do you imagine this
366038,the nft stands for nonfungible token in other words all of them is unique
366039,its possible to build zeroknowledge nfts and you could wrap an existing nft into a zknft but thats a whole other rabbit hole
366040,was wondering how one can send nfts from a doxxed address to a different safe address
366041,you can get hacked
366042,theres also accidentally selling it very cheap to totallynotmyaccount
366043,you do bring a good point though aside from ahem losing your hardware wallet nfts in a boating accident they dont mix very well with privacy
366044,hahahaso opensea seems to have a problem if you bought an nft at a juicy floor the new owner has no idea that it was stolen and put up for sale until the original owner reports it as stolen and new owner is stuck with an nft which is now flagged rekt scammers likely havent found a way to mix nfts owing to the non fungability nature and so that may continue as an issue for os
366045,but once you transferredsuch mixed nft to another wallet your second wallet is still doxxed nft mixing would only work if they are sort of fungible like if there are 1000 of same nfts
366046,aztec connect might do it in near future
366047,unique nft goes in one address and comes out another address same owner even if not you kinda need to visibly sell the lie
366048,does selling buying back from a nftx or sudo pool give plausible deniability
366049,well your nft will still be flagged
366050,tornado by the definition can only work because the tokens are fungible so you got your answer in the nft acronym
366051,how long til exchanges freeze deposits coming from wallets that have interacted with tornado cash
366052,here are some stats on the looks unlock for those curious
366053,i think coinbase already does this
366054,fuck
366055,sad state when opting for privacy criminal activity
366056,wen poisondao spam random addresses with tokens out of tornado if everyone is a criminal no one is a criminal
366057,we already have secret nfts
366058,its a problem with ethereum and public by default chains not with nfts inherently
366059,secret network is built on intel sgx not ideal for a privacy solution but probably good enough for nfts
366060,wont post a very long thread about it but were also integrating research on fhe etc just if ppl are interested in this topic you can dm me its live in prod for 1yr
366061,the nfts that is network longer
366062,is there any traction on this kind of nfts pretty sure ppl want privacy around general nfts and not a specific implementation on a separate chain could be wrong
366063,yes weve had millions in volume hundreds of collections the key use case we have seen emerging is around the freetomint use case reputational identity gated access also many bridges emerging were an ibc chain also looking at crosschain contract calls
366064,theres already multiple nft chains beyond eth that trend isnt slowing
366065,
366066,here you go
366067,this is live
366068,not yet railgunorg has that feature it wont mix it per se but youll be able to transfer it to someone else secretly and then they can do the same without it reaching a public address
366069,dont think so am not following them much
366070,opensea is just one site though theres a lot of places that can do atomic swap for an nft
366071,indeed checking here is stashh the best marketplace to get an idea of the nft ecosystem on secret atm
366072,yes disclosure am a cofounder also can checkout legendao they are the ones doing kevin smiths movie release as an nft the mint for that went live this week
366073,can take to dm ivan likes to ban me
366074,p
366075,is that private to secret network validators too or simply outsiders looking
366076,validators cant read the data enclaves so its private to everyone except the person interacting w contract
366079,although im not a fan of his and his firms investment strategy he is pretty good at his job if i was an lp id trust him if i was a founder then maybe not so much
366080,in all seriousness are there any research on how different types of vcs how much capital each strategy deploys shapes up and coming industries like defi are there any economicindustry research on similar topics
366082,ie like how long term value investing macro investors and their ratio wrt to amount of capital deployed impact new industries like crypto internet industry from 19902010s electricity industry in 1800s etc what are lessons that could be carried over from public markets where you have ton of data
366083,crypto is only a sector of a16z
366085,nan
366086,less cynical more empirical
366087,interestingly enough there was a blacklisted hop sybil address that dispersed eth in an attempt to get more addys blacklistedwas here
366088,vc by itself is the antithesis to defi just like celcius blockfi is the antithesis to defi the clue is in the name
366089,did the original bitcoin project needed vcs should decentralization need central entities if so to what extent and whoever determines this goes against decentralization itself
366090,not sure empiricism of that nature holds any water here the money is going to keep flowing if a16z and friends nudge crypto into being a worse copypasta of the stock market under the guise of helping value investor we rly care storytelling if anything they get more money and less competition that way
366091,i get the point but lets try to strictly look at use cases of the underlying technology and businesses built on top of it arpanet and the internet didnt take a business to become a thing the use cases of the internet on the other hand
366092,i was expecting oh in public markets if there are more macro ride the wave money circulating around then that makes the rise and fall of markets even worse and according to papers xyz heres how that plays out in the private markets and papers abc suggests thatd play out in these ways brand new industries
366093,i think bitcoin is not the new internet but its certainly the best form of money so far as for the other blockchains i think there is obviously potential for replacing old parts of financeadministrative institutions that required trust
366094,but people only care about number go up and alarmingly tons of new devs do
366095,you obviously didnt study economy to see that most of them are more interested in money making than paperresearch making powell recently said they dont know much about how inflation works that should tell you everything about how academics in economy science works
366096,i think were having 2 separate convos im sorry i ever asked tis a wrong place for such discussions
366097,this account has spread flat out lies about nexo before just saying
366099,baseless fud letter not even well written full of mistakes lets move on
366101,
366102,under collateralised loans is like cryptos communism will always fail and have people claim that a true form was never tried
366103,defiour machinelearning based credit score ispick one
366104,you guys are fast reader yikes
366105,then we will never replace traditional lending
366106,yes
366107,why cant both be together
366108,because one of those is inherently centralized
366109,oh you mean the lending decision is centralised well yeah
366110,and thats okay but lets not call an elephant a turtle
366111,but that is just for undercollateralized loans
366112,reputation is a multi round game when the cost of quitting the game is zero you have incentive to not repaycant work around that
366113,
366114,3ac
366115,nan
366116,lol true again like i said i dont have much hopes but wanna see how it goes
366117,ofc dont want it to build up to like billions of dollars in loans before failing
366118,just small experiment size is fine for me
366119,basically you are saying the concept of credit is broken
366120,exactly
366121,is it really 0 maybe if you dont factor in opportunity costetc
366122,people like 3ac love adrenaline
366123,umm thats something else tho right they were not giving any collateral lol
366124,they gave some collateral to blockfi
366125,credit with no consequences of default
366126,nope youre being too general the concept of credit is good but there are risk inherent in it that cant completely be eradicated defi eradicates them by being overcollateralized which kind of defeats purpose to begin with
366127,sers lets not beat around the bush too much you have already reiterated the only point there is to make all good
366128,thanks for saving my ass
366129,does anyone know if i lock my ftx with the yubi after enabling the 5 yield on the app do i still get the yield
366130,i can get perfect credit wait till there are 10 reputation based lendersif those lenders wait till addresses have years of mileage they will have no customers
366136,does anyone know which protocols are on masterchef v2 and which are still on v1
366137,cant the cost of quitting the game be no more access to the game
366138,who is going to enforce that and how
366139,enforce what access
366140,no access back
366141,well you get access back
366142,but youre staked upon reputation
366143,no stakers then youre the beginning of the ladder
366144,which presumably is penalising in terms of interest
366145,nan
366146,this is me being sad after my reputation has been reset
366147,imaging how cheap i can buy good reputation at the middle of a bear market
366148,ah interesting buying reputation
366149,but your stakers would be slashed
366150,oh noes my stakerz
366151,in principle there would be a minimum cost and scale to repeating that trade
366152,not saying it wouldnt be profitable but not to a grand scale
366153,like credit card defaults
366154,how wouldnt it be profitable
366155,not paying back a credit card is profitable
366156,you can enjoy your purchases
366157,like your jet ski and your paddling pool your watch
366158,this is nothing like credit cards
366159,credit card defaults prevent a person from getting future credit cards there are 23 credit card providers with cross checkshow will that work for an address in defi
366160,this is only an exploratory conversation
366161,just riffing
366162,yeah so theres my comparison
366163,banning what is essentially alphanumeric gibberish from using a contract does nothing to return the money lost or prevent you from getting a new account
366164,the new account requires staking on
366165,that is one implementation and just means you have to coordinate to pull it off
366166,my address defaults it gets blacklisted across defi already highly unlikely since why should any protocol blacklist me for the reason that someone decided to give me an undercollateralized loan then i go in and out of a cex and i have a new address that can build good credit only to do the same againwill give myself a nice bonus once a year
366167,yes i think blanket fresh accounts with no history interaction will have to start at a horrendously low base
366168,this is the requirement ye i dont think you can have undercollaterised with reputation or trust
366169,think of it as how do we outsource trust in a scalable model
366170,imagine the lengths people go to to game airdrops i dont see any reason why they would put less effort to game uncollateralised loans
366171,the upside to access to global credit at the very top must be valuable enough to the best allocators credit and capital to offset the losses from the initial scammers defaulters gaming access to the system
366172,well you just need to look at 3ac to see what it looks like
366173,their upside is capped since the alternative is using an overcollateralized loan
366174,no no only this isolated system can blacklist you others can follow suit if they like the score
366175,hmmmmmm
366176,if everyone follow suit you will have an on chain credit rating agency be it centralised or decentralised
366177,yeh im not completely reinventing the wheel just think perhaps more peer to peer attestation of ownership could be a thing
366178,many people cant prove the assets they own
366179,what i can see is using that score to calibrate your personal collateral ratiogood returning customer you get only 115 fresh address 150
366180,most physical assets cant be onboarded onto crypto without solving an oracle problem
366181,yeh sure
366184,or having a legal framework to accommodate on chain assets
366185,yep its all an enforceability piece
366186,at the beginning everyone is friendly and nice they repay their debt on time and all is well in the world with every repayment the system trusts them with progressively more credit maybe they even survive a bear market until one day it vanishes and youre left with a missing 10bat which point you announce we have banned the account
366187,yeah
366188,that is what could happen
366189,in the real world equivalent depending on where you got the money from some nice men with a 5 wrench would come visiting to ask you to search your couch for any change you can spare very nice menthose nice men dont exactly have anything to hold onto with smart contracts
366190,if youre the point or requiring credit from men with wrenches indeed youll tell them your wallet address to stake on and indeed theyll break your legs
366191,perhaps they will send you one of these and hope it does something
366192,i expect the major usage of the credit will be then traceable on the blockchain btw so you wont have the same bilateral attestations that banks crypto lenders have struggled with
366193,if you make no affordance for decentralization then the solution is pretty trivial weve had that since the interestingly named salt days of 2017
366194,well as trivial as a regulated lending business can be
366195,what would you say the core protective tenants of the regulation on this are
366196,that is up to the regulators to decide no or more accurately it would be up to you to demonstrate how their current rules whatever they may be dont apply to you
366197,but the core requirement regardless of how its spun is centralization somebody needs to be able to knock on your door in the event however unlikely the bottom falls out whether that be with a nice 5 wrench or a nice set of documents
366198,for the lawyers in this group what are the odds that the team gets held accountable and how long is the timeline for a case like this
366199,i remember when alameda or ftx announced their investment into them i put them on my radar but stayed away because vibes in discord was off backed by republic galaxy digital alameda research ngc coinfund kraken curious who the dumper was
366200,thread said investors through saft0 dumped
366201,through saft0 means preseed right
366202,no according to thread these were leftover tokens from public sale sold via otc
366203,does anyone else feel cz is too active on twitter nowadays
366204,thanks for clarifying very problematic the allocation was never disclosed for all anyone knows it could have been a family member
366205,nan
366206,who decides such a thing especially here
366207,telegraphpost0715131 fyi lobs
366208,i put 15k into one ring seed round but never claimed anything is there something available to me
366209,notsofast retweeted __for the past 8 months a billionaire exchange owner has been threatening harassing me into giving up a domain that ive owned since 2017binances cz arguably the largest proponent of decentralization has resorted to centralized means in order to steal a domain from me
366210,its our domain now
366211,lol for all we know it might be a scammer posing as binance
366212,possible but i doubt it the thread is pretty detailed
366213,he did overlook something in a certain tweet but ill leave that to adventurous eyes to notice
366215,rs og btc 2012 he aint going down without a fight
366216,i guess it was the second round only 5k
366217,
366219,they are good that is fake im pretty sure
366220,until its not
366221,best not take a chance
366222,luna was good too
366224,dont think they would be in process of buying distressed companies if they were insolvent
366230,binanceca is the domain seems like a domain squatter to me
366231,lobsters im participating in the solana hacker house for uxui and i had an important math question if we have a combination of 3 elements for the generation of an image nftif we target 5k nft max for each user how many properties should we require i found that i had to use factorials in a way but i definitely suck at math
366232,3 different types of element like hat shoe and socks and you want a total of 5k combinations of them
366233,if so you would just want 17 or 18 of each since 17 cubed is 4900
366234,or change one or the other element 20 hats 15 shoes or smth more variety of one
366235,yeah just three numbers whose product is around 5000
366236,hum thats a bit problematic i have to think about adding types of elementsit was actuallybackground imgbackground colorlogo fixed so it doesnt count as a proprety id guesspattern
366237,i want to have it as users dont have to create more than 35 properties
366238,thank you guys by the way i truly appreciate it
366239,that really complicates our idea x_x
366240,so a user has the opportunity to create nfts with 345 properties each
366241,yolo
366242,what we wanted to make is that users will be able to generate up to 5k nfts from 3 imagesbut after seeing both your responses the idea would be to know how many total attributes users will need starting from an inputlets say a user wants to mint 1k nfts the formula should give the amount of elements needed in total which well then simply divide by 3wed be solving two problems that way first well not require more proprieties from users who want to mint only 5 10 or 15 nfts and lastly well enable users to mint more than 5k nfts if theyre able to provide enough elements
366243,if i understood well both your reasoning that would be solveinput x3
366244,isnt domain squatting illegal
366245,our main thing is to keep types of proprieties as low as possible3 would be ideal 4 would be ok 5 would probably be a limit which would make what were building pretty bothering for users as its an event tag generator that were building
366246,if net nfts of all cases are 5kassuming nfts minted of 345 properties are equal ie 1666then defining properties sample space becomes 16660333 1666025 166602 each
366247,166602 meaning in case of 5 total propoertiesyou can have each property variations of around 45 each
366248,oh then if i understood you wellit would be each proprety user_input13
366249,that would be optimal as i expect most users will probably mint 1k
366250,you can also just let users input how much of x y and z they want to enter for each property and compute resulting number of nfts to minted as a xyz
366251,oh i think i can also go for something as simple as that but the problem is that with what we develop users will know the total nfts first before knowing the x y and z its event tags so itll be based on number of people who attend your event which can serve as basis to know how many elements youd need
366252,overall i have a clearer idea now on how to proceed if you guys have any additional feedback let me know i just wanted to thank you very much for helping its my first irl hackaton so i want to make my newly met teammates proud of working with me
366253,
366254,he owned the domain before they had any rights to it
366255,he might win the case i have no idea what canadian law says about squatting but he says he registered the domain for his bisexual girlfriend nance hilarious but it could work in the us hed lose pretty quickly
366256,likely being facetious but yes hes probably going to lose ironic situation considering cz and friends have probably spent as much on this farce already
366258,shes real she just goes to a different school
366259,yo lobsters anyone of you using or used crypto market data api like coingecko cmc cryptocompare or others im conducting a research hoping to learn more about your api use case and user experience please dm me if we can have a chat about it
366260,
366261,wen ens suit
366262,been using all of those at hodlersh appcmc is really good but expensive also they had a policy if you grow to 100k mau they can disconnect you cryptocompare became paid at some point and i switched to coingecko which was good stable and free with the right limits
366263,hey was trying out the hodler app last month and shared with my team too love the simple sleek uiah thanks for info coingecko rocks ps i work at cg always open to hear feedback from anyone to improve cg products and api happy to learndiscuss with our users even if its being used as competing siteapp thats what keep us innovating to do better and grow the industry together
366264,weve done this a few dozen times and made some of the elements tradable between collections oldie but goldie urlrmrkappdemobird
366265,anyone got the link to something shared recently allowing you to check the token balance of an address over time
366266,thank you for sharing but im not sure to understand how its similar to a website where people can upload their proprieties elements
366267,i actually read the article but im not sure to understand why you shared it sorry
366268,oh you need a website thats already done and just static parts something like a web ui for hashlips
366269,noo i need to make a website for that its just 1 of the two parts of a dapp were developing for hh paris
366270,i dont get it
366271,depends all on the domain if its literally binancesomething hes in the wrong here
366272,in general all this bro im gonna build an app on it stuff is weird looks like hes trying to squad a domain that clearly violates a registered trademark and it doesnt matter whether the domain was registered first afaik
366273,ah yes its apparently binanceca the guy is a dumbass for believing he has any basis for keeping it
366274,ok couch lawyers case closed
366276,so you mean you register a com domain and you automatically get the rights for appropriate all extensions from all other people who registered them well before you
366277,is this how it works
366278,no thats not how it works it has to do with registering a trademark not a domain but this is very jurisdictionally dependent stuff and talking about it in a generalized way will upset ivan
366279,hey friends i recently wrote about our experience using discordjs at noble check it out
366280,lobster daily 472 daily recap 14 july1 lobsters at ethcc paris link to discussion 2 a samurai a knight and a yankee by arthur hayes read link to discussion 3 your guide to the collateralized stablecoin landscape linklink to discussion 4 a16z is top 10 crypto villains spray and pray into shit projects link to discussion 5 mixer usage reaches alltime highs in 2022 with nation state actors and cybercriminals contributing significant volume read link to discussion link to discussion 6 reputation is a multi round game link to discussion
366281,also rainbowkit is a really nice library for web3auth d
366282,hey guys im currently building a decentralised platform which will help emerging crypto experts validate their expertise and thus increase their following and reputation the platform will enable people to make predictions on various crypto events chosen by users themselves correct predictions could then be tokenised and displayed on web3 and web2 social media platforms please dm if you find this idea useful or interesting
366283,its only tokenised after the fact
366284,so pure vanity utility
366285,that cover image is a vibe
366286,how can you tokenise expertise before its verified in terms utility its not about vanity its about integrating these tokens ie quantified expertise into the existing ecosystem these tokens will be nontransferable and represent a fair evaluation of ones knowledge about crypto
366288,degenscore with extra steps
366289,if i understand your question correctly youre asking about how my platform would be different from degenscore right i propose a framework for evaluating expertise fairly using prediction markets created by users the expert score will depend on the popularity and complexity of the events predicted and correctness of the predictions
366290,experts are usually those who are simply netting 51 of wrong bets not 100
366291,nan
366292,not sure if i understand your question are you asking if you can still be an expert without a 100 correct track record
366293,this is amazing lmao
366294,lol
366295,the uniqueness of japan
366296,
366297,what your opinion on this guys
366298,looks interesting
366302,is this basically me trading and others putting money on the same trade
366303,too many complex terms for me
366304,while social trading is a cool idea it has many different ways to be implemented and was attempted back in the days with an onchain fund even the one banteg had and things like set protocol in a way for some reason neither of those implementations have ever caught up with what the tam could be while influencers rake cash in scam posts of moon soon weird
366305,is dhedge and enzyme social trading
366306,interesting yeah ideally it should work i guess but i think the issue is you need to be part of every trade trader does to be net profitable with the same size ratio just entering into one trade would lead to huge gains or losses right
366307,single trade might not serve that purpose
366308,yes that wont work
366309,ye you need all trades but past acitivty never future performance
366310,we are actually trying to solve it plus adding the fun levelbut the solution or at least as we see it has to build on several levels or layers
366311,thats true too
366312,every trader has cycles
366313,after each successful period there must come destructive one
366314,well thats true but still a better chance than being in a single trade
366315,if i may share as we are on a topic our first iterationlayer is
366316,the platform identifies relative expertise you will get more expert tokens if you correctly predict the outcome in a difficult market difficulty in this context is determined among other things by the number of incorrect predictions in the said market
366317,theres several problems with social trading but basically1 theyre few to no consistently profitable traders worth following2 if one actually appears their strategy gets so crowded that it seizes to be profitable3 if the strategy is public people can simply copy it without going through the social trading platform
366318,yes all these three are correct
366319,wish harmony cared more about improving its tech but it seems to be focusing on things that dont even matter see their q3 focus
366320,to add to thissocial trading is not scalable as a social trading platform the usuals they expect a developer to build end to end development pipeline from fetching data feature engineering feature evaulation and testing strategy building risk management there are cases with simpler profitable trades as well but those are long tailed and we cannot manage much capital on those strategies
366321,the foundation is falling apart from the inside
366322,i think the original harmony is in a very difficult position
366323,yea harmony always late and wrong to everything they stumble without a welldefined plan with the sharding that is already a bit old fashioned that is why a large part of the team left the project
366324,successful traders on most platforms get a cut of the profits others make copying their trades right its effectively a way for successful traders to have a hedge fund without having one they get to deploy more capital to their strategies and get a cut of the profits
366325,by definition successful traders are successful because they dont share their trades right
366326,ignoring fixing their apis rpc security repegging bridged assets etc but focus on minting nfts and adding a fiat onramp i think its possible they become a ghost chain
366327,not necessarily cfe burrys short of tesla there are big trades where youre rewarded by talking your book as more people jump to the trade you benefit
366328,this doesnt apply to copy trading on retail platforms of course that is mostly a scam to facilitate more customer trading and thus more commissions and often times more profit for the brokerdealer cos they trade against the customer
366329,
366330,there was no trademark
366331,but that is clearly not gonna stop them
366332,well if you had a high certainty trade signal you really wouldnt have any incentive to share it because you would expect that marke information to get incorporated into market prices regardless of you telling everyone however theres an incentive to share pseudo trade signals if youre motivation is to get other folks to ape in and turn your trade signal into a self fulfilling prophecy
366333,i think l am one of these traders being followed by public creates a great security concerns we sometimes share strategies for profit too to be honest l wont use gcrs short list to make some anons make a couple thousandsand during the trading journey you turn into more selfish as long as your profitness increase and get more afraid that your strategies will be copied or stolen
366334,at crypto right now there is not enough liq for even top traders how can you add more funds without enough volume its not wise for risk management
366335,the real question is how can you add size and not dox alpha on chain analytics firms are plying more and more sophisticated analysis anyone of size or anyone with good strats are getting rekt by nansen
366336,its a real problem in the ecosystem what youre on about here the shelf life for creative alpha is just so short in defi
366337,maybe they will have mechanism for preventing liquidation hunt
366338,i usually trade on binance most people l know too some minority trades on ftx except bull market barely trade on defii use nansen too especially to execute some strategies its essential
366339,yeah why come up with a trade strat when theirs a subscription service for alpha
366340,thats tricky i wonder how much liquidation hunting is based on i know fund xyz is here and my size their size
366341,i dont believe in alpha every trade is another and independent battle you can not gurantee it will work always
366342,theres a great debate about this right theres importance to getting people on your bandwagon but you dont want them to get in the way of you getting on too onchain analytics makes it tough for heavily tracked folks to buy a position
366343,or maybe i wanna shop otc order flow and need to unload a big block do i need the world to see that idk i think the way onchain analytics work now are a bit of a perversion of price discovery
366344,so like this battle isnt hard when you have an element of privacy i also dont buy that there isnt alpha theres people who lead the market ie renaissance technologies was a alpha shop for a long ass time in tradfi if nansen was a thing back in the day would these dudes have made the gains they did i think not
366345,even if its not alpha its trade secrets right how can i charge mgmt performance fee when people can just copy trade everything i do
366348,3ac leaded market for a while lts ok as long as you lead and push price alone to 69k without a support problem start when market leads you
366356,yeah renaissance has been consistently bringing in 66 annualised returns over 30 years and basically have done an incredible job in not leaking any info to outsiders
366363,exactly 100 this is the key privacy protects gains this is my stance self adjudication of what others can see is mission critical in adversarial markets
366382,one point to note though is that privacy is oftentimes being used synonymously for intransparency privacy enhanced tech and blockchains adopting them are showing us that this seems to be common misconception which also led a lot of larger corporates to jump on the bandwagon of aping in into the idea of private blockchains thinking that privacy can only be established by reintroducing opaque and closed systems
366416,lemme post something interesting for peace
366417,i think this is a fair point there are things that need to be transparent and things that shouldnt ie a smart contract i can verify by looking it up and looking at the code to see its going to operate as i expect this is critical but this doesnt mean that my balance should be public because i participate in crypto markets
366418,exactly spot on we can have transparent systems while respecting user privacy this isnt mutually exclusive but in fact complementary and imo one of the biggest opportunities of web3
366419,why profitable trader would even go through hassle of participating in social trading at first place this is the most important question which has to be solved imo
366420,we expect this with our fait finances when we swipe our debit card we want the vendor at bobs soda shop to know that were swiping our card and it has enough to pay for our soda however bob doesnt need to know how much money i have in my bank account in total or how much ive spent where in the past nor should he be able to follow me into the future forever as long as i use that debit cardidk how we got so far down the crypto path with no wallet side privacy i suppose its why i work on this stuff the product fit is just a no brainer really
366421,there is no reason correct
366422,regarding the alpha ive observed quite a few time an interesting phenomenon which is very logical once you think more about itwe were publishing alpha calls several times about the incoming dumps in the marketthe mix of onchain and social data analyticsyet almost no one seemed to care much some even went angryafter the market crashed after the analyses we did get some appreciationsome bought subscriptions as wellyet the real alpha of when to leave the market seems to be somewhat very little discussed or even addressedmost participatants keep looking for alpha understanding by it what and when i can buy which imo totally wronginteresting human psychology
366423,i feel that most of people are new into crypto and dont understand that you gain more by knowing when to leave than when to enter
366424,yes thats obviously the case
366425,wasnt like that in 20152017
366426,i still wonder though whyfor me the first 6 months in crypto was enough to get what is important namely exiting the market or rather partially rebalancing to stablesthe rest is so secondary
366427,i believe people do learn and actually adjustits just they dont talk much about it especially these talks arent appreciated to say the least once market pumps again
366428,i agree with youmy personal analysis is that most newcomers see crypto assets like any stock investment or even worse lottery with higher of successthey dont want to learn they want to flip without any knowledge so alpha groups seem to be the best solutionhow many people have i seen not understanding a word on a basic cg page
366429,human psychology if you win its thanks to you if you lose its because of the market
366430,so trueor its because of manipulation or terrible alameda lol
366431,never because of stupid me
366432,exactly the never learn philosophy imo
366439,for chit chats there is lobsterdao kingdom in here anything not proper content is permamuted
366441,king ivan
366442,amazing to see this is finally becoming mainstream thought instead of fringe thinking
366443,permissionless but privacyfirst accept no substitute
366444,introducing the revolutionary pay2chat model
366445,absolutely also for defi i think this has the potential to be a real gamechanger and bring forward a new financial market infrastructure where tradfi simply wont be able to keep up with
366447,
366449,thanks for posting this what a great article
366451,interesting wondering why anyone would put in the effort to create something like that feels almost like whoever wrote the script for that video lost a lot with ust and is trying to make up for it with a persiflage on founder cultism he himself ironically may have fallen for wondering whether people upset about do kwon are maybe just upset about themselves but then again as long as stuff like this helps people find peace of mind why not
366452,maybe they just wanted to make something they thought would be funny and none of what you are assuming ever crossed their mind
366453,yeah probably youre right
366458,because ivan is still in stables
366460,hello does anyone know the crypto wallet address of paypal robin hood and webull
366463,hey who is in fwb discord is it worth it i think about a year ago social daos and token gated communities were a hot thing how are they feeling right now
366476,why are we pumping questions got a permban gm spammers
366477,looking into this now at least 5000 people have signed up to become early settlers
366478,a16z investment was the best exit liquidity
366479,they are defi alliance before that right
366480,
366481,impressive how are users not churning though
366482,i guess people always wanna gamble tho so there is that
366483,30x leverage
366484,much higher than other perps
366485,you are not arguing with my point though
366486,churning due to losses and liquidations
366487,new money enters all the time fair
366488,people hedge if funding rates are better on other platforms or general hedges
366489,also no kyced perp platform so there is that as well
366490,interesting oxmikko apeir99n
366491,some info on hedging
366492,
366496,slowmist hackers implement phishing attacks by implanting malicious js files on the premintxyz website deceiving users to sign transactions of setapprovalforalladdressbool thereby stealing users nfts and other assets
366498,
366499,i doubt it looks any different on centralized derivatives exchanges tbh gmx just makes casino pl transparent for the first time
366501,well its not a secret that most traders lose money kek
366503,public platforms are so stupid
366504,whales are just using this liquidity as they wish
366505,muh transparency
366506,i get your point but not really
366507,everything is easily trackable and can be literally build into own tools for analyzing public participation
366508,trades dont settle differently on gmx just because whales see it that would be retard system manipulation so if that is not happening that means people are just gambling as anywhere else whats the problem w transparency then
366509,ok sure
366510,
366511,yup for public its same as elsewhere you can just see it now
366515,there are a few daos with quite a few in treasuries and they need to work spend grow in some ways and they lack outside participation grants program and whatnot what would you propose to them to get paid for asking for a friend
366516,btw why genie why not looksrare gem opensea etc xmons
366517,pretty sure those are wip as well
366518,
366519,hum not sure why its taking time
366521,anyone here a accesscontrolsol l33t i wanna add it to my contract and have questions pls dm
366522,i dont understand canto hes layer 1 but why are there so few developers even a few validators are running
366523,its a weird experiment is what it is
366524,is it worth degen
366525,for info some of the convos in this thread can be interesting for you most was indeed discussed there i dont see the purpose apart from truly just an experiment bro
366526,that u r free to discuss in kingdom here we dont do trading or investments
366527,there are only 3 contributions on github
366528,have you tried running the validator sir
366529,
366530,link to ze info
366531,
366532,whats costing 47m
366533,might need to go mckenzie on their org structure
366534,i think they are ready for the mainnet because on the 20th it can be tried the project is very fast i suspect its security
366535,the exact info from your next message mckenzie like corp structure
366536,noice lobsters thoughts on use casees
366537,hey guys do you know where to read any details on the modern vamm implementation details such as polysynth dynamic curve
366538,docs source code
366539,they have pretty great docs a bit of an aside but are there any edge cases where using safemath for sol 080 they use it here and i am not sure its necessary
366541,hey guys i have a question and we can not finalize direction as a team let me as you if you are building a frontier tech project is it wiser to deploy on eth or one of major l1 especially for transaction fees and fundraising are problems will the merge lower transaction fees and will it be easier to fundraise on eth
366542,merge has nothing to do with tx fees or fundraising
366543,if u re building defi project which has to be compostable with major protocols and supposed to be used by whales ethereum is your choiceif u re building retail oriented dapps for defi gamefi nfts and etcchoose other evm chains or l2sfocus on user cases not fundraising
366545,wont txt fees will be lower with merge
366546,no
366547,the merge effectively just swapping out the consensus mechanism
366548,we are building something new i have a fear that if we deploy it on layer1 someone can steal idea and copycat to eth network but l can not fundraise on eth
366549,there wont be any direct if any at all effect on txfees
366550,why would this be any different if you deployed it on an alt l1 like polygon or avalanche
366551,where can i get more information about what happen exactly during the merge like at the exact moment it happens what are the eventual side effects etc
366552,
366553,userbase on eth is much higher than any other so its a risky bet for us to deploy brand new idea as like uniswap or opensea to somewhere else than eth
366554,yea so the whole process is supposed to be seemless for end user right like the actual transition doesnt require to do anything specific
366555,nothing to do for dapp devs
366556,there always will be copy cats if idea is good focus on what you do rather then worry about what others do
366557,whats ur fav solidity editor i used to like webstore but free trial is over and was wondering if theres anything good hate vscode cuz its made by the devil
366558,vscode
366559,uh originally it was bc genie had the friendliest linking schemaapparently gem also supports the address suffixwould have preferred not lr or os bc they dont show everything
366560,webstorm by jetbrains solidity plugin
366561,yep what i thought what happens in case of failure though whats the emergency plan while they rollback the chain or whatever
366563,what sort of failure mode do you have in mind
366564,fork fails chain stop being usable for a bit like something real spicy
366565,imo visual studio is pretty cool has also a lot of nice plugins like solidity visual auditor from consensys
366566,i rather have my soul intact
366567,shrug wait for the chain to start finalizing again
366568,yeah for sure if you accidentally choose the wrong ide your code will start to smell and you might end up in hell so better be safe than sorry on this one
366569,it might die if everyone forgets to also run an el client for instance but if they dont fix their setup fast then their stake will start leaking
366570,i think it gets real spicy as price of everything probably start cratering on cex and we have all of defi stuck lol
366571,in that specific scenario i think the chain will still advance its just that it wont be able to finalize if theres not enough of stake attesting
366572,i see
366573,also l2 keep functioning right
366574,might depend on the l2
366575,51 of stake for the chain to make progress 23 to finalize apparently
366576,so theres definitely a world where it makes sense removing some of the borrowinglending or any other type of leveraged positions preemptively
366577,or migrating them to another safer haven for the time being
366578,like i wouldnt want to have to wait for chain to start working again while i cant know what the oracle price of eth will be when it does and people furiously market selling on every exchange bcuz eth iz ded
366579,for 5k it would be approx 17x18x19 so around 54 assets but it can be 151820 if you have 4 its almost the same maths its a simplified version of permutation maths but way enough in this case
366580,thats how i think in my collections and never had doubles
366581,you can divide 55 by the numbers of attributes you want and tada
366582,but thats a strict minimum better if you increase your base layers a bit so its not redundant at all
366583,lol this is true for almost all decentralized social networks but ive installed a new tumblr a year and a half ago called newlife made on blockchain for creatives artists and weirdos it has extremely minimal interface with no words or icons which is supposed to be intuitive but i am still not sure what to think of it and i often forget how to navigate it there are no likes the lenght of pressing the image with your finger shows how much you like it when you stop pressing it another imagevideo pops up this feeds the ai to come up with better results for you it has some potential to reinvent social media mainly navigation but its a bit sketchy for now and strange but it certainly has interesting parts that builders need to check out would love to hear other opinions maybe these kinds of social networks already exist i just havent seen them its much more minimal than tiktok
366584,idk if you want to implicate children with crypto
366585,some web3 elements pehaps
366586,this how that newlife social network looks like on mobile
366587,where is your github idea list again please send ser oxngmi
366588,indeed but judging by my child who plays roblox the part of the clout and part of better metaverse experience is owning digital assets such as better homes with more utilities or cars to be able to get to other parts of the virtual world quicker or to be able to unlock stuff to get this they are trying hard to earn virtual moneypoints or ask parents to purchase them with fiat they wouldnt care if its points they are earning or crypto as long as they can get a hold of that virtual asset they like within the world edit ive just seen you were talking about social networks not games
366589,
366590,
366592,note its easy to confuse ideas that are dope and seem like humanity needs them with real problems that people have that need solutions
366593,
366594,
366595,incredible story
366596,not sure about this statement defi lending is not in a place where it can be used by traditional or real word entities because of overcollateralizationthe statement suggests that overcollateralization is the problem why defi lending isnt used in the real economy dont think thats really accurate lombard credit or pawnshop loans are counter examples for this obviously not saying one should take out a loan at a pawnshop except maybe when pawning against some dirty undies or so
366597,yup big volatility price overcollateralization is better
366598,i remember seeing a wallet that runs some security checks before submitting txs but forgot the name does anyone remember
366599,mostly agree but defo not all of them are like that anyone knows how this works in the traditional world postraise
366600,same some are good others arent
366601,1actually its pretty tough to get good partners even if the vc firm is good
366602,so its not just the firm but the partner you are dealing with
366604,how to reach good ones
366605,better rely on your personal opsec mate rather then on outofthebox solutions
366606,
366607,
366608,its like anything else the more in demand your project is the more choice you have between investors if you have the choice you have to do your research and look at previous investments and talk to other founders etc
366609,nice some people posted it already
366610,thx for the links ill keep the debate for another time but personally more bullish on better security ux for marginal users so trying to find whats out there on that front rn
366611,but some people still waiting for yours
366612,here
366613,there was another project like rai that was working on similar ideas but havent released yet anyone knows what i could be talking about
366614,bankdev
366615,bro hes just a youtuber ahahyou overthink too much
366641,unfortunately their impl contract is not verified
366642,so probably decompilation only thats not a nicest way tbh
366643,yeah probably youre right maybe good to watch a bit more and think a little less life is like a box of chocolates
366644,hello sers anyone that claimed the evmos rektdrop has any link to s faucet for the initial gas maybe thanks anyway for the attention
366645,emm just want to explore which kinds of crypto element can attract younger users
366647,for lobs who builds airdrops hopefully this is useful infrastructure for you it works off updateable merkle proofs has token vesting and builds all the claim ui based on the deployed contract reach out if you can think of ways to extend the framework or integrate it would love to hear from other devs
366648,just google evmos faucet
366649,gentle reminder that if youre running an eth mainnet el node eg geth erigon nethermind besu etc youll also need to run a clbeacon chain client alongside after the merge and connect them together or your node will stop syncing new blocks
366650,you can get some practice with the currently merged testnets like kiln ropsten and sepolia
366651,great reminder as this fact is not made crystal clear for execution node runners imo
366654,hey guys im looking to understand tokenomics as a beginner do you have good resources to suggest thx
366655,
366658,thank you guys do you also have more technical resources not for investing
366659,
366660,
366661,how are the builders here feel about kycing for their gitcoin round claims
366662,
366663,i wrote some more bullshit on governannce curious what u think
366664,
366665,fuck me ew
366666,with what i have experienced with completely decentralized ao here are my thoughts dao will not develop well if there is a token that doesnt bring revenue imo dao should be built around interest to contribute in order to get revenue rather then interest to contribute in order to earn tokens with a token it will be a game to earn more tokens rather then develop a product itself if the projects get revenue even in a bear market it is much better base to make dao even stronger
366667,makes sense to me yup
366668,1
366669,i dont really see a reason to have a token as well if product makes revenue this revenue can be used by dao to further develop projectpay salaries and even invest in other projects that potentially could increase a revenue or reduce costs for a project itselfand for governance could be used nft as 1nft1 vote
366670,pure revenue stuff can never scale enough if you want to grow acquire users and go exponentail and not live on 2 margins you need to create capital and have credit debt
366671,otherwise you get outrun by those who can create it
366672,great thoughts ivan ty for the share
366673,agree but its much more stable then having volatile asset token can be issued later for additional perks if there is a base
366674,one thing is to make the dao sustainable financial wise which should always be goal 1 another is making profits which i dont find that motivating or relevant
366675,if you dont wanna go exponential you should stay in the smaller vibes league and never make a token
366676,well each successful product is built around idea not around getting profit
366677,its like a social nonfinancial dao then
366678,1 and for teams that already have token live they should look to alter the emission schedule
366679,i would love to add my 2 cents i came up with idea of the dao governed by nft holders where the nft contract is owned by the dao itself so dao controls emissions and sales like some sort of investor board
366680,that kinda is lobsterdao technically speaking
366681,i think were dealing with spectrums not categories i have no idea what im building i just know ill never work for a trad org ever again
366682,it can even rug your images lol
366683,ok your maker application has been rejected
366684,whoops really i wasnt aware of lobsters structure now would love to buy a lobster asap
366685,there is another problem that most of daos with token have tokenomics some of them even from 2016 still work but almost not active but suffer of bad tokenomics
366686,cc pshenichnyy
366687,buzzed bears have same struct as lobster and born last year or so
366688,we tried to decentralise day one biggest mistake of my work carreer
366689,could anyone here introduce me to someone at wallet connect interested in their v2
366690,since wen a non fungible token is not a token issuing nfts is a token issuance you arw just reducing supply i guess and incentivising a secondary market of fractionalized nfts most probablyan nft governed dao is not a tokenless daoa tokenless dao just formed by wallet addresses has no way to ponderate the different commitment of its members therefore becomes inefficient
366691,i agree nfts are a token in this case
366692,just one layer of abstraction and a funny cat image
366693,yes its a token but its a completely different economics with nfts rather then having own made tokenswith nft its more like a right to do x y z with a token it will be a game to earn more tokens
366694,and when there is such a will there is always a problem in dao ecosystems conflicts with interests high user turnover
366696,nft is more personalized with it you know who you are who you belong to and what do you want
366698,ethereum devs since 2018 be like
366699,somehow i agree with the economics part but erc20erc721 are technical specifications and standards both may have the same end resultyou can have erc20 with a max supply of 10k and make them non transferable and play with them or have a erc721 minted by the millions and will have no real difference in practical terms to an erc20 what i meant is that the relevant part are the economic dynamics and how do you plan a healthy incentive mechanism to incentivize coordination with multiple parties with different interests and one single goal dump on its neighbour the techs are mere tools what matters is the essence of the game dynamic
366702,the big difference is a part of inflation usually tokens are staked where you get some apy so there is annual inflation witch without new users just creates a sell wall with nfts its only inflated if there are new buyers
366704,i dont think you got my point tbh nfts can be staked as well if you want and you can do a million things further to staking with an erc20 again it is not erc20 vs erc721 or whatever it is the incentive mechanism and the dynamics you design what matters anyhow as said i somehow agree with you that some protocol value transfer should be in place to incentivize a healthy development of a community
366705,
366706,any good way to track refering websites on static html pagegoogle analytics aint doing a good job at this
366707,killing people you dont like is so natural let it beagree with the whole idea tho just being natural doesnt mean right in 100 of cases
366708,after reading i have only one question how to get code fot the party
366709,implications
366710,kinda become dictatorship maxi recentlyu can name it differently but disruptive things can be made by strong leadership with vision and goals processes
366711,are univ2 lp tokens rebase
366712,theres a time and a place for everything decentralization for the sake of decentralization isnt always the best idea that said sometimes it does take a solid team to drive a project especially when there is financial related matters involved from the get go but sometimes its okay to hand off certain day to day responsibilities to a community
366713,no pool ownership tokens
366714,reading the letters in the bankruptcy filings is interesting
366715,nan
366716,lmao
366717,im a patriot
366718,received same lets see where it goes
366719,roflmao
366720,you going to feed the machine i never have the energy for it
366721,doing it since 2017 can give lessons
366722,feel left out can the scammer please message me too
366724,this was probably originally supposed to be sent to an infowars group
366725,ive worked with her in the past talented girl
366726,
366727,that is kinda good less manipulation
366728,are there any zk based bridge solutions i cant seem to find any and interested in digging into it
366729,look up nil foundation
366730,jesus christ bancor is now pausing withdrawals because volatility
366731,funny story been here since november 2020 bancor was always a safe bet for me a set and forget ive just capitulated on my eth 3988 2098 and am about to do the same with my 22132 qnt 8485 sitting around knowing the deficit is increasing and my stacks were vaporising before my eyes ceased to be an option trust and my patience is lost and the final kick in the teeth that ive lost another 1 qnt in the time i took to start the withdrawal 15mins ago and now being told that withdrawals are paused thanks bancor its been a joy
366732,
366733,ooofff
366734,omg
366735,collat worth about 400m at current prices for 24b loanhow do i sign up for dis bls ser hook me up
366736,collat was short 400m collat was not worth 400m
366737,
366738,
366741,is it me or is anyone else suss on this rally 3ac and cel assets have still not been liquidated right
366749,some of the things might be stuck though nonliquid and can take years so who knows
366750,thanks to reframe it was more of a process question i thought any aum would be locked and then sold by the liquidators not fully aware of how that process works or how transparent it is to the market given filings were very recent
366751,have they not i think a lot of their holdings have been sold off
366752,trying to understand how best to verify
366755,well their defi holdings you can see
366756,when they paid off loans
366757,you can check if the eth they got back from the loans they sold
366758,also there are lenders that held their collateral and took it when they couldnt pay back
366759,benevolent and capable dictatorship
366760,20 percent of ours do but i still think that at least 50 should be raised by giving power to public
366761,
366762,lot of 3ac prob was along the way the amount of money they borrowed was crazy
366763,this rally will fail like all the others
366764,stfu fudder
366765,eth 10k by september
366766,fake account admin pls ban
366767,maybe maybe not impossible to know for sure
366768,i have satoshi and vitalk on the phone confirming the price of eth and btc must go down
366769,as far as i know 3ac assets have been liquidated and simon dixonteam are moving in with a restructuring package for celsius so that the assets are not dumped on the mkt if they are sucessfull then there wont be sell pressure coming from celsius distressed assets big boys are trying to clean up the mess
366770,its stated in teh docs if assets were liquidated or there is not data
366771,the genesis assets was liquidated in the form of gbtc shares approx 510mln out of 23bln liquidated if taking gbtc shares price as avg between today and the start of 30k sell off
366772,tbf a marginal 10 improvement as block times crunch from avg 14s to almost certain 12sbut yes other than that no direct fee impact
366776,does this mean a vesting contract wasnt used
366777,there are ways around token lockups either way no
366778,just sell your locked tokens on via other means or make hedging trades
366779,there shouldnt be
366780,if they are locked they are locked
366781,but yeah you would be able to hedge it most probably
366782,ya theyre locked on chain but whos going to stop off chain action
366783,same way as gold is locked in a vault but no one was moving to around even though the economy was backed by it 50100 years ago
366784,it still adds friction though
366785,anything i should claim with my lobster dao nft these weeks
366786,
366787,there are a lot of modular blockchain frameworks being developed for monolithic blockchains to enhance scalability here is a deep dive into how subnets helps scale the avalanche ecosystem
366788,you can join the nft gated chat
366789,hi all anybody knows where i can check sizes of ethereum testnets fullnode
366790,i can help with that
366791,please
366792,whats point of hiding data on a dapp until you connect wallet web2 minded devs
366793,there can be some points it can increase conversion some dapps require wallet related data and probably its easier to hide them instead of mock web2 minded usersi also angry on this stupid thing but it should works with nonpower users
366794,its strange isnt it the merge can make lido dao 1 but they sell ldo at low price looks like i dont understand something
366795,the secondary market has decided to give ldo premium and then some members decide to disregard it kinda ye indeed not sure if timing is smart there also given tokens r liquid
366796,ftx immediately announced perp listing after the proposal went live
366798,steth on l2 the merge are the best narratives for lido
366799,
366800,mostly fugazi but i like jerking off to useless math
366801,i cant imagine the scale of winter if lido sells tokens for operations for next 2 years while people start talking about the merge
366802,merge will be old news in 2 years like 1559 is now
366803,well from what we know they are pretty bad with timing like most founders in the space they need to learn from chikun and eth foundation how to prepare their ship for harsh weather
366804,why should a protocol wait for proper conditions on the market to deploy features that they promised to deliver in some specific time
366805,yes but now we have the date of one of the most the longawaited event in crypto space
366806,what is dumping their own bags a feature now
366807,we talk about steth unlocks or ldo now
366808,im talking about ldo dunno what you think over der
366809,sorry then i dont get how does it affect the winter could you please explain
366810,were discussing about proposal where lido dao want to sell 2 ldo and get money for next 2 years it looks like preparing to the winter on the other side the merge can affect ldo price in positive manner
366811,oh gotcha thanks for explaining i see it in a next way there is a huge chance for a winter rn they most likely will need cash to keep operating during that time otherwise lay off the stuff which is also affects the market could be wrong here is 2 really a dump also
366812,yeah my point is that founders miss timing and selling tokens in todays environment doesnt necessarily represents the top or something more in the middle lido team is probably not substratum
366813,we are talking about 2 supply its huge amount
366814,is alameda golding lido very likely they do otherwise why perps or may be some big holder paid listing
366815,previously they wanted to sell 10k eth to dai for the same reason i think its better to dive deeper into topics may the decided to sell ldo instead of eth
366816,anyway considering their arguments about need to pay salaries what would you do in such situation
366817,followed the data from the protocol made the same amount 30m for last year
366818,looks like they make enough money for salaries
366819,but eah need more research cause this metric is protocol revenue share of the staking rewards that goes to the protocol ldo holders node operators
366820,probably worth requesting better explanation from their side but according to straightforward logic i highly doubt they have any shady intentions especially considering the fact eth foundation closely watching for them with questions to decentralization
366821,there is nothing shady just any dao sale will always look kinda weird just this time secondary market participants wanted to play the merge narrative and are upset that the demand is being partly met by the dao sale and not just pump forever that being said that doesnt mean it wont happen money is needed and if the proposal wasnt made now it would have been made in 2 weeks same same
366822,ropsten 147gbrinkeby 202gbgoerli 106gb
366823,curious to know where can we look for these stats
366824,we run a lot of nodes hence we can just see it in the monitoring not aware of a public service exposing such data maybe we should build one
366825,just to be clear this is full nodes not an archive nodes
366826,yup
366827,why rinkeby is more popular
366828,rinkeby is not pow but both rinkeby and ropsten are to be decommissioned
366829,how big is an archive node on eth is it possible to bootstrap one without having a supercomputer
366830,erigon is under 2tb
366831,for mainnet
366833,took a random erigon 22tb
366834,do you know some services like maybe verifyinvestor that let you submit kyc proof to a dao that says yes i am accredited and not american citizen like basically a zk kyc where there is no counterparty that you submit docs to but the service just processes your docs and gives you an output to present ps i do not need any upcoming 2025 ico need a product that is ready blz
366835,there is always a counterparty wdym
366836,with verifyinvestor you dont actually give your info to the party asking the kyc it just gives you an output but it only seems to be for accredidation limited in scope
366837,the 2017 ico meme of imagine a wending machine asking ur pub key just to verify
366838,but lowkey legit need it haha
366839,theres stuff like litentry fractal kilt who run entire productsblockchains for this but i guess it depends on who will consider their output legit enough to acknowledge it
366840,those are all icos ser no any poduct thats working
366841,dont need a whitepaper link
366842,also meh parachains
366843,it doesnt at least whatever documentation it spits out will have no meaningful value
366844,litentry works is being used to mint our soulbound20 stuff here phalaworldclaim via kilt is an inproduction chain being used already for this stuff but i have not used it for anything other than registering identity so dunnofractal is just a forprofit company doing kyc and outputting a verified did for you that has the data you need
366845,it does a friend passed it once before
366846,great thank you brb doing homeswork
366847,i did it too to prove i am not usa based when investing in a usa thing is really smooth but i am not 100 convinced that would be legal proof enough
366848,a us project afaik took it as a confirmation though so is good enough
366849,this
366850,no meaningful value in the eyes of any regulator
366851,can fireblocks go the way of celcius or 3ac
366852,re u psychopath ivangbi
366853,
366854,wow why do they have to shill gearbox so hard kek
366855,shill in the lobster kingdom chat further shills will be permamuted
366857,anyone from ftx here
366858,did they fuck you finally
366859,not really
366860,i wish
366861,is this just a random question or have you heard something they offer insurance although that probably means shit if an implosion occurs but also youre not giving them your keys theres this weird sharing keys thing but you still have access to your keys and can withdraw anytime so its not like they can take your coins and go farm like some of 3acs mates we use fireblocks for stuff where gnosis safe isnt practical so if you have real provable concerns id love to hear them as id prefer not to be caught with my pants down
366862,no just trying to be careful very hard to trust anyone these days
366863,they promise not to touch or trade but do otherwise
366864,
366865,a prime example
366866,youre right to be paranoid its almost a must have in this space although from all my research fireblocks seems an acceptable risk tradeoff
366867,insurance you can export your own keys no funds lock up pretty strong contractual agreement
366868,thanks
366869,well that depends if thats a fresh sync or not but sure probabaly with growth of mainnet this flex is gone
366871,does anyone know how wonderlands rebase gets called is it an automated off chain script that runs it who pays for gas costs
366872,
366874,how are you storing themthe convention is _ address1 address2 address3 address4 address5 hreethersgetsigners
366876,no yubikeys here ha
366877,wow
366878,do you like scandals intrigues investigations
366879,im from latvia as well and hear about it for the first time need to dig in
366880,ok i checked that problem is not only about crypto but about banks overally they can close acc without any notice if you might somehow be connected to nonlegal things that is why many businesses moved from there and i moved from there as well as even if you will pay tax that will not stop banks and government to find loopholes to close your accounts etc
366882,just talked to him he is ready for a longterm play court could take up to several years lol and in this case he will need to prove that he wasnt part of launderingpoor guy what can i say
366883,yeah while real ml laundry billions they catch the guy who even paid tax i really like the site which he made dataset is awesome much better than most of the dune dashboards
366884,in reality there were also russia related banks that laundered much more before but they worked as they just paid the right people in advance
366885,theyre xrp cripple schizo spammers
366886,bait them and you will see
366887,they use that wording to bait conservative american boomers in telegram too
366888,another reason to go bankless
366889,hey fam we released a small featureprotocol for compounding fees on univ3 and published a whitepaper explaining how it all works any feedback much appreciated
366890,does substrate have this sound cool
366892,hello fama friend of mine has started a crypto company that helps web3 protocols companies compliantly hire onboard and pay remote employees theyre currently running user interviews this week and are looking to chat with other web3 crypto founders to understand the painpoints that companies in the industry are facing let me know if youd be interested in chatting with himno nft drop no farming rewards vetoken to win unfortunatly but at least that will make the life of builder easier if it works
366893,hi im interested
366894,delete if pdfs not permitted google drive link i thought it might interest people how curve can enable permissionless liquidity mining we setup a pool w their factory a gauge for our reward token we had to ask curve to approve our distribution and update their user interface but otherwise it was close to permissionlesswe then also had to create a custom script for distributing rewards to the gauge each week bc gauges are week by week we are currently using gelato instead of chainlink keepers to automate that but works with either tool slow and steady defi is getting more autonomousif youre launching a new token w liquidity incentives consider curve you dont have to go through governance vote for noncrv rewards sushiswap onsen balancer bancor rip uniswapxtokenterminal etc all had problems that we couldnt solve in a fully decentralized way
366895,thank you for positing
366896,balancer can do the exact same thing would be curious to hear the problems that couldnt be solved if you dont mind dming
366897,speaking frankly the documentation on lbps was interesting but it was unclear on the permissionlessness of rewarding xeth pools with 3rd token y i really liked the idea of changing the weighting of pools over time but my goal wasnt to distribute a pile of tokens to buyers directly for price discovery it was to create an incentive to create the x token which must be minted from the protocolif i were looking to reward xeth pools in x token w a price discovery mechanism for x to raise eth for a daotreasury i think balancer lbps would have been a primary contender and honestly not opposed to doing a yeth lbp w y rewards via lbp in the futurebut curve was more clearly visible that you can do xeth with y rewards and it had examples like stetheth rewarded in ldo that made it easier to coordinate what i wanted wo trying to ask for something newunheard ofi didnt see examples of this on bal nor documentation on it outside of lbps for fair launch pricing
366898,what youre describing will be possible with a managed pool which will be available later this year an lbp is not designed to have incentives or to exist in perpetuity noting that the lbp discussion is separate from this as curve cannot do lbpsprobably a fair point that we may not mention 3rd party reward tokens in our docs ill look into that ldo is doing the same thing on balancers wsteth pool though so it is possible but like with curve you will have to ask us to add your reward token if anyone could add any reward token to a gauge it would open up attack vectors
366899,yes when i talked to michael at curve that was his point too on why add_reward needs permission to reduce attack vector yeah lbps are totally different than curve pools i reviewed managed pool documentation originally misunderstood boosted pools as what i wanted but its differentbalancer is great i regularly recommend it to people will keep watch on managed pools later this year and consider it for future projects
366900,audere_est_facere
366901,would be cool if there was an easy way to avoid attack vectors tbf ideally wed want to remove gating as much as possible
366902,thanks sir
366903,hi will dm you
366904,any chance to post this somewhere safe pdfs are definitely a no go
366905,virustotal the pdf b4 opening it
366906,sometimes virustotal doesnt detect stuff though
366907,is docsend best they dont have a free tier lol annoying to pay 10mo for 12 docs haha
366908,set it up on gdrive and people can read via google preview
366909,google drive link thanks
366911,any unity devs in here looking for paid work
366912,whats the attack vector for allowing any token to be a reward
366913,you add_reward an unverified erc20 with the approve function secretly calling wethapprove or baycapprove or setapprovalforall or similar and then when users claim_all their rewards they get your scam token and if they try and use it they get drained
366914,i only can help with webweb3 stuff ser but dm me maybe ill find someone in my network
366915,is this smth about the way that reward managers are designedin general calling random approve fns on unverified contracts is safe in that even if within that context it calls approve on some other token youre not actually giving your approval to anywhere else
366916,thanks just dmd
366917,not sure my understanding is the approve or transfer of an unverified erc20 can have effectively any known contract call inside eg wethtransferfrom victim to hacker
366918,they check the reward token when you ask curve and soon bal to approve it our reward token was verified on etherscan and fine
366919,wut
366920,wethtransferfromvictim hacker amt would require an approval from the victim to the caller in this case the aforementioned erc20 contract no
366922,ok to clarify i thought the reason they didnt have permissionless add_reward was because scam token could have scamapprovemsgsenderwethapprovemsgsender amount 2xscamtransfervictim hacker amountwethtransfervictim hacker amount wethbalancevictimcould be wrong on this being possible though
366926,approve doesnt work like this
366927,the caller has to be the one to approve
366928,not from another calling context
366930,gotcha ok then the attack vector is different apologies was thinking it was similar to the nft setapprovalforall or something but that probably is context specific too then idk the attack vector
366943,is there away to get callbacks from a node whenever a new block comes in
366944,geth websocket subscriptions or similar might be the closest thing
366945,may be easier to use etherscan api for some issues but for polling blocks you can simply poll blocks through your own node much easier not to loose data in this case
366946,ye i think zhongfu nailed the answer
366947,shared some thoughts on spvs being a better fit for financing bottoms up tinkering in web3 moving us closer to capital formation coordination moving at the speed of innovation hoping to hear more opinions on the topic to evolve my thinking here
366948,
366949,ive done this while developing apps because typically the metamask rpc connection is used to populate a majority of the dapp data and rather than bakein a separate rpc connection to use until the user connects its simpler to conceal the app until the user connects
366950,i sort of convinced myself it was a better decision than forcing the user to use an api they didnt ask to use but web2 does that on basically every page ever so i should probably change my thought process there and just bake the damn rpc in
366951,ohm story continues
366952,chicken bonds
366953,you dont own enough
366954,in fact you dont own any
366976,yawn air your dirty laundry somewhere else pls
366978,well the kleros ubi drama its a fair discussion tho sad that it became drama instead of an actual discussion
366980,yes i just wanted to share the article not discuss it here sorry everyone
366981,hmm
366987,i think the problem is that for the people that built proof of humanity its a sybilresistant registry but for the community thats grew around it its basic income there are different priorities and trade offs depending on the vision
366988,ill step out of the conversation so lobster doesnt become this drama again seems that the best place for this dicussion would be the projects governance forum
366989,q i used to be able to press on functions in github and see where they where declared and stuff right form the website seems like this feature disapeared or smthfor example
366990,whats wrong with flashbot rpc recently my txns never going through what are much stable and better options for trades only
366991,maybe
366992,mev protected or not if you just want your own rpc use pocket network
366993,oof that sucks so what rpcs arr left now that offers private transactions
366994,not sure tbf
366995,maybe bloxroute
366996,i wonder if manifold sambacha allows for private rpc usage and can fill that void
366997,i think they charge for the service and then the other one from gasnow closed last year
366998,yeah they charge 015 per bundle
366999,the largest issue for flashbots protect was that people just spammed the shit out of it and it was free
367000,this is why we cant have nice things
367001,txn not even going through it is stuck and fails later on
367002,hows eden network is that a better option
367003,they dont provide rpc for retail traders for protection from front running
367005,how do i find out number of users on analytics platforms like nansen and dune
367006,hi guys is there anyway somehow one can look up if a coin is being twapped
367007,like bought constantly
367008,between block x and block y table pool address eoa from address to asset from dexdata
367009,name a uniswap pool feetier block range and i can pull it for you
367010,im looking at binance alts
367011,and im not that technical im sorry
367012,you could pull the orderbook and every trade and map market orders to see if there is any consistency
367013,twap best visualized over a chart tbh
367014,yes
367015,im searching for all methods to identify a twap
367016,is there usually a deterministic pattern that you can write deterministic logic to classify with otherwise id train a ml model of course that is given that you have labeled data possible to generate it using a simulation
367018,id just look at of orders that cross into the spread from a buy sell persepctive
367020,
367021,dont think this is sth thats worth a long form discussion feels like you could just ab test this stuff
367022,uni governance is one of the biggest jokes in the space funny reading things like sets a precedent for a whole industry
367023,10 of lp fees
367025,do you guys have any good suggestions on a tool which is good for publishing and visualizing datacurrently i used notion i also came across mirrorxyzwas wondering if there were any other options out there that are recommended
367026,neither of those seem geared for data vizsmth like observable hq would be what i have in mind
367027,never heard of this before let me check it out
367028,1 for observable
367029,yea this looks quite cool
367030,i also got a suggestion for obsidian which i used before and substack
367031,check this out and some others i have saved uphopefully youll find something useful
367032,i will thank you
367033,damn those are really cool
367034,i could always just create the charts and data viz on other platforms then upload it to my blogs but im still figuring it all out and the plan right now thanks for the new resources i can add to my catalog guys
367035,wash trader on looks spent 25eth to washtradeaddy has some looks staked of course just trying to understand is there a good way to estimate the real fees the addy is incurring look lol at the amount of looks staked as a of the total pool for starters
367036,vega one love
367037,its quite easy to get the data with ape slice with pandas and plot with altair which outputs vegalite
367038,hi all what you guys think of optimistic bridging compared to locally atomic externally mpc multi sig and natively light client header verified do think its future of bridging
367039,i think its really falls down to understanding the underlying trust assumptions trade offs with optimistic bridging you gain simplicity and reduce costs while security is weaker than with light clients there video by the ethereum engineering group is a quasisok of the different bridging approaches highly recommend it it predates nomad but touches on optics nomads was born out of the work of optics
367041,if i buy eden tokens in a wallet eden rpc will work on that wallet only any good alternative of flashbots cheapfree and work across all wallets
367042,anyone here have tested if illiquidmarket is legit want to make a otc deal and heard about them
367043,it is for the wallet that staked edengenerally it is a good backup to the flashbots relay for submitting bundles no tokens required for that
367044,are there really this many full stack web3 developers looking for jobs or are all of these messages not here specifically but all over tg scamsbots for some purpose
367045,98 scams real devs dont have time to post messages on multiple tgs a day they have to deal with constant things to build and other nonlegit offshore recruiters harrasment
367046,most are scamsbots but those who arent are just bad quality not recommended
367047,without holding their tokens i can use front run protection right any other alternative to flashbots i read about pokt but that doesnt provide front run protection
367048,manifold finance aka securerpccom
367049,how do i add this rpc to my wallet
367050,you have to change your metamask settings just like adding any other new rpc details will be on the website
367051,
367052,damn i need some airdrops too
367053,70 instadumped
367054,tbh i dont think its wrong of perp to dump those they made extra efforts to deploy supported the ecosystem early and decided on this could have used for rewards but maybe they chose instead for now ps unless dao founders sell dao owned tokens but that is not the case here afaik
367055,have you guys heard whether snx stakers will get more op tokens
367057,unless tongnk says that this is misinterpreted from the getgo
367058,i dont think its realistic for daos to hoard non revenue tokens just to be polite in the next 2 years well see widespread collapse of daos who didnt diversify into stables and have a worthless treasury honestly surprised uma range tokens didnt get more popular for daos
367059,ser i asked a question about chat rules in dm 3
367060,that already happened to most of the first daos from 2017 year with the followed 20182019 bear market unfortunately they are left with almost dead community and 12 devs who are working on projects if they have a spare time
367061,and lesson wasnt learnt
367062,hopefully a few daos are waking up at least a few hold ethwstethusdc and not just their own garbage but unfortunately a lot are allin on their own supply
367063,one of the reasons core team are mostly devs without business background that what i have experienced
367064,exactly why were building resonate need for a system to deploy native treasury tokens is high particularly when that deployment can result in slow diversification
367065,new sip said snxeth lpers get it
367066,not snx stakers if im not wrong
367067,its really really difficult for daos to diversify their treasury at pretty much any stage and if you do it successfully you end up like nexus mutual and have governance wars where people try to get you to dissolve and pay out your treasury to token holders
367068,idk problem with deploy is its indistinguishable from dump on early true believers we have completely different dapps with completely different fundamentals and revenue flows being 8090 correlated with each other until the average crypto buyer including institutions gets way more savvy daos will continue to fail i advise a small hedge fund on crypto and it took months to get them onto their own gnosis safe understanding how aave works to take short positions permissionlessly these are multidecade experienced traders but crypto is just a mindfuck to them
367069,gemini gusd i mean isnt anyhow a creditor to 3ac such right gusd solvent
367070,so are lobsters excited about zkevm
367071,i dont know what is a problem to add risk management into governance where of apy or revenue is autoconverted to stablecoin could be weekly monthly whatever
367072,genesis is winklewoss venture apparently so who knows
367073,thats probably the best way to do it but you have to have a clear revenue stream to do that which makes you less competitive most of the time one of the reasons uni hasnt turned on the fee switch subsidizing the revenue with token emissions is probably the best way around that but token emissions have their own issues like obscuring real usage data
367074,gemini earns biggest counterparty was genesis i dont know how much gemini itself was impacted but id imagine they were
367075,thanks will avoid for now
367077,
367080,jump didnt lose so much with luna case
367081,they made profit
367082,thats not how it works in most of the times 0 fee or 001 fee doesnt play a big role for big traders if there is good liquidity they will use more secure liquid platforms with good uxand even if the project doesnt have revenue it can still sell of the treasury for the worst times its all about how economics and strategy is built in advance
367083,in the case of dexs most of the time the fee comes out of the lps pocket not the tradersgmx trader pays a fee part goes to glps part goes to protocol glp subsidized with tokendydx mms provide deep liquidity and good pricing because they get tokenscurve vecrv holders get an admin fee that would normally go to lps lps are subsidized with tokenseven nondexs have similar patternslido takes a cut from staking still well ahead of the competition because steth is very liquid and integrated everywhere token incentives had a large role paying for this level of integration and liquidityyeah there are protocols that take fees without this pattern but normally they have a wonderful niche and little competition ens is an example herei agree you can always sell a portion of your treasury but its hard to orchestrate cuz the community is often against it see sushiswap see maker
367084,i agree that most users dont care about fee that much but they do when it comes to price impact
367085,we cant even get our op airdrop because they introduced out of the blue kyc requirements
367086,in the case of curve lps get crv which gives them access to fees from other pools as well exposure to fees from other pools without being exposed to assets in the other pool
367087,yeap agreed thats why im thinking that we are too early to be too decentralised this transition should go slower while daos gain experience or governance metrics should be changed from the start or proposals should be described in details with all risk outcomes as usually those who vote dont think about future either and dont have enough background to understand as well
367088,i think this precedent shows their real culture allegiance is american vc and not cryptoopen source ethos
367089,i thought i am so smart to make out of lusd arb with printing looks like i am a moron eventually a leveraged position which dies after a 3 drop to try to get 10k usd on 15m notional anyway lol rekt still poor back to work random numbers
367090,winklewoss took vacation after the liquidation event
367091,the rai arb was the real play that thing tapped 313 like a month ago so sad i missed it
367092,dummy q for da lobsters to what extent are the implementation differences between looks and opensea able to make looks compose better for nftdefi or does it have no effect
367093,i dont know noodles built the whole brand rage trade shitting on protocols need better source cant fully trust the source as its biased
367095,basic question does this belong to universal zk rollup category according to l2beat so far has only starknet
367096,
367097,
367098,100 days
367099,
367100,aave website dns issues
367101,attempts to download a file
367102,just an issue on the redirection to the ipfs deployment from the appaavecom nothing securityrelated
367103,so just a bad redirect
367104,some misconfiguration but should be fine now i think for reference
367105,anyone
367106,dont think opensealooksrare are composable in a defi sense at all sudoswap is since its onchain
367107,sudoswap has other disadvantages though its a dope niche product i think
367109,what do u think r the disadvantages maybe need to list rarer nfts in different pool what else
367110,its another provider of instant liquidity for nfts
367111,agree here will help provide more and efficient arbs
367112,nan
367115,lobster daily 477 daily recap 19 july1 crossruntime governance readlink to discussion 2 treasury diversification 2 at lidolink link to discussion 3 where to check sizes of the ethereum testnets fullnodeslink to discussion 4 permissionless liquidity mining with curve read link to discussionlink to discussion 5 is there a way to get callbacks from a node whenever a new block comes inlink to discussion
367116,
367117,my testnet is better than your testnet
367118,im using it and its quite cool actually a ux problem for me is that you have to deposit your nfts when listing since its all onchain you cant list on multiple platforms listing is not free gas costs for sending erc721 tokens a spicy aspect is that they dont collect creator royalties that might become interesting for all those nft collections whose only income stream are those royalties
367119,i dont think its a big problem though sudoswap kind of targets nft liquidity with their model and those traders for which liquidity is important sweeps are using geniegem anyway
367120,so id say its a nice niche super useful protocol atm
367122,i think that yield play slows down over time as folks realise what a good riskfree opportunity it is in a bera and start minting rai which then sends the pid controller to raise rates and lower yields
367124,just gave my response here i think this is a bad idea
367125,i mean that is the idea but if you play the integral right youre at extremely low risk of any sort of inversion
367126,how do we think the auto loan repo rate rising will affect the market my thought is that it is a pre signal for re issues but people will liquidate their crypto before they will get evictedso 3 months from now expect sell pressure across the board
367127,sov is in with another long writeup this time on polygons matic history of grants evolutionenjoy the read imho ivangbi as it comes from the post also lobsters following polygon in general since 2018 it is pretty evident that the focus has always been on not focusing and doing everything at once the spray pray strategy might work soso in investing where the power law distribution turns returns into a belowinflationnumber but it worked in this case probably because founders havent slept in 3 years throughout the entire bear back when we all got rekt on binance ieo sandeep kept hustling doing countless calls and just trying to do everything even the grants the dao approach dont seem to organic and 100 things happen at once and is just their weisome people take hustling as dirty and not genuine i am one of such people due to my laziness mostly i dislike empty sales pithces networking events and crap like announcing before announcing and thats a large portion of polygons success and many other projects polygon have just really outdone it haha anyway everything is a strategy after all and after a while people forget about what was before and only look at results and at this point polygon has acquired a few things projects announced pilots with a bunch of brands be it due to inherent external interest or paid deals which all led to organic traction at this point those who have fought before are now deciding to organically also deploy there do you believe the means justify the end no one is right you decide for yourselfthat is not exclusive to polygon though as other chains have also seen surge of demand due to multichain future being shilled to us all and tokens being printed lets be honest its mostly the shitcoins and new incentives most of the time what survives be it plasma or sidechains rollups or whatever else vitalik make up tomorrow i know he doesnt code himself but people do follow his word we shall see the journey has been quite something for them cheers to the workers builders
367128,future upgrades can target interop with other marketplaces through contract signatures eg seaport
367129,you can get insta sell quotes but you can also just list individual items
367130,how come tesla have a metamask folder in their website source code is that the metamask im thinking of or something else
367131,nan
367132,both are right both are wrong both are dumping into our books anyway
367133,so does everyone
367134,great read thanks ivan i think the underbelly of companies like polygon who grew through spraypray hustling is theres a high probability they forget to dig deeper products need depth for long term success if a company forgets that then theyll either lose or fall apart when a shock to the system hitsbasically if your business is under threat and you dont have core product lines that will endure that no one can effectively compete with then youre screwedyou can see similar cases with how ge fell apart fall of tons of asian conglomerates during the asian financial crisis in the 90s etc
367135,both have huge egos and are dumping on people
367136,not gonna lie im in it for the tech and the memes
367137,the memes are amazing
367138,and a lot of them just dont show up on google search
367139,
367140,nan
367141,are otc trade transactions data available on chain
367142,lol
367143,absolutely based and redpilled
367144,nan
367145,my ps skills are very limited
367146,are there open source alternatives to pyth network
367148,paper hands means he just had rent to pay and more than a few baby mamas bro dont be so hard on a brotha
367150,
367151,just gonna bump my old questions1 is there an open source alternative to pyth network 2 are otc txns recorded onchain
367152,looll
367153,go read the wiki on uniswap v3 github repo
367154,you will have to clone it to read it as they deleted it
367155,they have a section on fees and well read it urself and find out
367156,well done xmons
367157,switchboard is the alternative not sure though
367158,sandeep has been on a victory lap all day lol
367159,
367160,polygon team in pvp mode
367161,if theyre finalized onchain sure if not no
367162,oof yeah stupid question but curious how what the breakdown is btw off chain otc vs onchain i guess i dont see why most people would trade onchain
367163,curious to hear what drives more volume to dexs compared to centralized ones
367164,more tokens to gamble on for retail
367165,is dex volume more retail driven or is it just whenever you see high volatility you have ton of trading desks arbitraging more i might dig a little deeper myself but didnt want to reinvent the wheel if i could just do some literature review type search
367166,otc is a bit of a brood title tbh there are otc deals that are between miners and buyers of enormous amounts of btc for example or there are quick 100k otc deals through trading desks some dont make sense to do onchain for tracking or other reasons some do
367167,hmmm yeah i think im asking more along the lines of firms like wintermute gsr and kraken
367168,as sneg55 said one thing is there are a lot more coins to trade on dexs than on cexs for obvious reasons another is that there arent kyc or similar issues to deal with on dexs and on and on many different benefits and downsides to each
367169,wintermute and there are some guys in here from there utilizes cexs entirely i believe to close their trades
367170,this is probably to have a deeper book and faster finalization of trades
367171,clearpool has kind of otc pools permissioned pools ex jane street and blocktower have the one
367172,i know its not trades but lending and can be related
367175,i think another reason could be that except for univ3 most dexs are based on passive lping whereas cexs generally require active market making as a result cexs tend to more regularly adapt to and incorporate new pricing information by virtue of frequently updating the orderbook even when there arent any trades happening whereas prices produced from passive lp dexs are less often updated because lps are passive except for univ3 and in a sense waiting for arbitrageurs to come and push prices back in line by trading agains the pool so naturally prices will tend to lag behind when there are only few if any proactive lps that actively market make so for passive lp dexs the more liquidity there is the lower the slippage and as a result the more trading volume one would expect to see because larger trades are needed to update prices accordingly and incorporate new pricing information to illustrate this consider the extreme case where theres one cex with active mms and one passive lp dex with infinite liquidity now if theres new pricing information then clearly it will be rather easy for mms to update their prices and have this somewhat quickly be reflected in a new orderbook state on the cex however now prices on the dex will be off and will require infinite trades to update the pool balances to reflect the new price attracting infinite trading volume
367181,nan
367182,does augur issue a fixed number of betshares per bettopic
367183,my memory is hazy from using catnip but iirc lps could mint more yesno shares
367184,from what
367186,this one
367187,was popular during usa 2020 election
367188,someone from etherscan at ethcc
367189,and you have shit tons of bots running sandwich trades and stuff as well right
367190,what is the best current blockchain node provider to deploy a tokencontract
367194,
367195,yeah that all makes sense ie volatility typically causes more volume and thatd be relegated down to dexs since more frequent price differences would mean more arbitrage oppurtunitiesbut im curious why would the ratio of volume btw cex amd dex ever change significantly
367196,idk why but this feels passive aggressive there are ton of data sources for both dex and cex trades to do some correlationcausality studies dont know why youre bringing up trading bots and sandwich attacks
367197,yes exactly so higher vol causes more arb opportunities on dexs also more than on cexs given the prevalent passive lping on many dexs which leads to more trading volume and one would expect this effect to become more pronounced the more tvl theres in passive lp dexs because then the arb opportunities get bigger and arbitrageurs can trade bigger sizes agains the pools until theyre back in line so paradoxically one could argue that higher tvl on passive lp dexs actually makes price discovery somewhat slower and less efficient because you need to move more capital to get new pricing info reflected in the pool balances and implied spot prices i guess theres somewhere a sweet spot though where you do want to have some meaningful tvl in passive lp dexs to be able to absorb normal trade sizes but having too much tvl could actually become detrimental for efficient price discovery as you need a lot of trading and volume to keep markets in line
367198,
367199,
367200,i tried all existing rpc solutions that claims to provide flashbot protections but reality is none of them actually work basic eth rpc is much faster and my txns never get stuck is there anything i can do about this i tried flashbot eden manifold securerpc txns never go through and it fails with these
367201,if you have issues with manifold sambacha might be able to help
367202,more likely to get it looked at by raising a github issue for manifold
367204,closing the closing speech is 25h later
367206,i see what you mean by price discovery being slower but why would the market wait for your trade on a large tvl amm finishes executing seems like the market would want the price discovery to happen at the speed of its fastest element
367207,
367208,yeah so maybe the word slower wasnt ideal what i meant is you tend to need more trading volume on a dex to incorporate new market info compared to a cex where you have a regularly updating orderbook also without trades happening
367209,
367210,hmmmmm i mean if some token was only traded on amms yes theres really no equivalent of l2 data in the amm world so yeah youd have to incorporate other data streams and god knows what sources and how long it takes maybe this already exists so speed of price discovery would be time to incorporate l2 like data for amms time for orders to executeif a token was also traded on order book exchanges then the consensus is that order book is where price discovery happens and amms just exist for quick liquidity so speed of price discovery rate at which it happens on order booksyou could argue that amms aid in price discovery would love to see some reseaech on this or conduct one if their isnt any literature on it yet even then id guess the speed of price discovery speed of fastest amm trade bit slower than order books at the moment though
367211,adding on to the slowness of large tvl amms what are game theory conclusions for example pretend you have 1 order book exchange where price discovery happens and 2 amms 1 with significantly larger tvl than the otherwould the market overall have more incentives to allow arbitrage to happen on low tvl amms therefore pricing out larger arbitrage opourtunities on a larger tvl ammperhaps its as easy as comparing the multiple of frequency at which arbitrage opputunities happen potential profit per arbitrage
367212,i think amms dont really contribute to price discovery thats a little bit the point i was trying to make earlier an amm with passive lps is just waiting for arbitrageurs to come and then adapt to that so the amm isnt really taking an active role in price discovery it is the arbitrageur whos pushing the amm to be in line and thereby establish price discovery and this relates back to your question what might be the reason of increasing trading volume on dexs compared to cexs where i think one reason is that most dex amms are passive and need arbitrageurs to adjust to new prices which entails having more trading volume in order to kind of update the dexs amm state and where the amount of trading volume needed to do so is higher the more passive lp tvl you have
367213,ahaha i see your point nowassuming amms adjust their price to the market through arbitrage out conclusions are then1 amm volume is of course driven by volume on order books2 ratio of amm volume to dex would increase in higher volume environment since right now is much less volume on amms so approx equal increase in absolute volume much higher percentage increase of total trading volume on amms
367214,yeah whats interesting is to also think about how staleness of large tvl pools could potentially find itself be interpreted as a market signal itself ie if lps remain passive not by accident or laziness but by choice then the staleness of a pool gets a whole different meaning and one might consider a deviation compared to a cex to be wrong in the sense that the cex is off and not the dex
367215,going back to the dashboard i shared there arent any noticeable bumps in volume thats only attributed to ammsthatd suggest amms still havent found use cases that would drive significantly larger volume to their exchangesmost prevalent use cases ive seen are dapps being part of amm ecosystem for liquidity and those guys dont need super high volume trades
367216,my hypothesis would be that the more passive tvl you have on a dex pool and the higher the vol of the given asset pair the more trading volume one might expect to see because more capital or kind of energy is needed to flow into and update the dex compared to other cex markets
367217,after reading some of the amm papers by the megabrain team of chitraevansangeris over the last year ive come to the opposite conclusion amms are not simply passive amms hold all the latent potential in this space arbs are just part of the necessary ecosystem and moreover the symbiotic relationship between those two organisms has yet to be fully understood or explored price discovery is an obvious first order effect of that relationship which itself hints at something far more complex coming in the future so perhaps amms appear passive today but only because theyre awaiting some innovation to unlock them
367218,yeah totally agree i was more referring to the currently prevalent cfmms excluding univ3 which afaik is the only bigger one at the moment requiring active lping because those require arbitrageurs to eliminate price discrepancies but yeah if you open up the amm term to also include other types of amms also those that havent even been discovered yet i guess then youre right
367219,hmmm i wouldnt worry or even claim to say that cex is off and dex is not its just people will have very different views on what the pricing would be and for some reason theres no incentive to trade across the twoor you have a case where theres too much execution risk on dexs
367220,yeah i agree although it depends on the way the lps behave on the dex so for example if you have a dex where lps are always passive then dex prices will always be off as long as there wasnt an arbitrageur to move them back in line
367221,does the paper detail what those complexities would be i only see 2 possible ways amms could add more complexities 1 investors and their execution traders look at pricing across all venues amms order books otc desks batch auction exchanges etc this would certainly impact how price discovery happens by setting an expectation for where the right current pricing is so amms have an indirect way of contributing to price discovery2 amms are used to bootstrap liquidity when conducting large private transactions a la ma like fashion or a sizable private investment fashion i think this is already happening to some degreealso do you have links to the paper
367222,octolinker is what you need
367223,actually i guess there is a 3rd innovationcomplexity first version of which is already implemented on uniswap v3 allowing stakers to choose a price range at which they would like yieldsif you think about it those staking positions are the equivalent of l2 data in order books as for why someone would rather stake than take a position in the market and would the stakers as a group have incentives to discover prices in an efficient way is left to be answeredbut if amms can figure it out they catch 2 birds price discovery and easy liquidity thatd breakdown the current paradigm of easy liquidity vs price discovery
367224,several papers propose a range of payoff functions that are mathematically possible but also allude at the end of the linked paper to future work where more complex financial products are to be discovered seriously do yourself a favour and just read the last 12 months of papers those guys wrote all on arxiv
367225,as a lawyer these papers get me really excited why because if the industry can create decentralised capital efficient derivatives natively on amms it will be very hard for the regulators to get the genie back in the bottle

367236,this feature used to exist right
367237,q is this the right way to write a proxy func in solidityfunction proxyfuncaddress payable _addr bytes data uint256 funcmaxgas public payable bool success bytes memory data _addrcallvalue msgvalue gas funcmaxgasdata
367238,have you looked at any example implementations of proxies
367239,ye i sorta copy pasta this one dono if its good
367240,also why call as opposed to delegate call
367241,intresting i guess i dont want it to access my storage
367242,
367243,it does but not for all programming languages
367244,i think it used to work for this file did they turn if off for solidity so weird
367245,
367247,i dont remember it ever working for solidity
367248,this is go tho
367249,ah yea hm i do remember it working for go
367250,it totally worked like 3 weeks ago
367251,didnt the light coin guy also do some insider trading too
367252,he did sell near the ath thats for sure
367253,charlie he denied it i dont think anything has shown otherwise but his timing was impeccable
367254,exactly great timing
367255,meanwhile
367256,then youre not proxying
367257,its just a call
367258,i guess technically its proxying in the more traditional sense but in solidity proxy generally means youre going to delegatecall
367259,looking at these amounts r so silly only made 15mil and the riskloss was a ruined career
367260,ive always felt this way about so many criminals like i have a number at which my morals get flexible too but its not that low
367261,i guess its subject to the same problems as any project though you always think its going to be way easier and way more profitable than it turns out to be
367262,i understand why they did what they did but if they played the long game they probably would have made a ton more
367263,maybe they thought they could pull out high 7 figures and they were playing the long game you can lose civilization pretty quickly if you screw up
367264,if i had like 50k in the bank and someone would offer me to make 1 milly i would not think much that is of course unless it was a true crime and when previously every exchange deal was literally backdoored i am sure none of these people thought they were doing something too evil to end up like this it really was just the norm truly
367265,i guess it depends on lifestyle too cause a lot of people dont change their lifestyle even with an increase in net worth
367266,does anyone know if excoo for opensea nate lost his stock in the company or not
367267,depends on if it was vesting or not

367278,thank you
367279,how are you sending transactions
367280,i am using this already it works same as flashbots failed txns and takes too much time
367281,i am doing tradings on uniswap and using this rpc on metamask
367282,i can send you txn links in dm
367283,it will take a slight delay than regular mempool txs because not every miner has access only participating mining pools
367284,yeah you can dm me i will look
367285,it will normally take anywhere from 2 blocks to 8 blocks extra typically just depends how much you are paying
367286,the securerpc endpoint should have 98 hashrate coverage regardless although rpc endpoints filter out txs based on a number of factors
367287,
367288,not trying to do legal fugazi just posting some facts
367289,from page 23 is related to the assets in question the 8 coins they taint w security drama
367290,they seem to be using the standard expectation of profits when invested product ready working or not common enterprise somebody working or not
367291,absolute insanity jfc but read for urself
367292,still cant beleive jai referred to rgt as shares
367293,charlie lee yeah and he was a coinbase employee at the time
367294,this is just one of the 100 little facts they pulled out this is true rektness
367295,by these standards even bitcoin is a security not even joking
367296,jfc they even touched powr lol
367297,
367298,eh that wasnt how i saw it there are plenty of coins that dont touch all the criteria mentioned and yeah they seemed to focus a lot on centralizationfakedecentralization
367299,1 product was operational or not at the time of sale bad if not 2 usd or eth raised funds are used for further development or mention being used for that bad if yes proceeds from this token sale have helped us continue to build out the flexa network bad3 tokens being an incentive to work and grow value bad rekt incentivize current and future flexa team members all supply from this allocation will be distributed on a fouryear vesting schedule bad rekt4 token model bringing value bad flexacoin is staked to collateralize every payment on the flexa network rekt5 any talk of secondary market is rekt easier than ever for people all over the world to take part in flexas vision of mainstream cryptocurrency payments and soon to stake those payments themselves while earning rewards for collateralizing every purchase rekt never mention exchanges or anything6 our team or any central development and authority rekt bad7 proposing lm or any such program any incentive of any kind rekt bad8 majority of the vote bad for example on both occasions where rari has minted rgt tokens the rari founders proposed the minting and represented a majority of the vote
367300,going down the list right now
367301,they touched every aspect
367302,comms funding dao voting share all of it
367303,yeah but theres no dialogue on how the criteria is weighted the howie test has multiple criteria if an asset doesnt fall under every criteria of the howie test its not a security
367304,12 are known 3 is kinda known 56 too but the issue is how hard they took words out of context
367305,some of these are common knowledge but jfc they reached hard for a lot of these to interpret in the worst possible way
367306,i mean not even mentioning exchanges but even the application to exchanges rekt
367307,this
367308,also how the hell else can you refer to something you personally worked on with another person we did this thing thats a paddlin dev diary updates thats a paddlin
367309,works here guess im all set
367310,this is stuff everyone used to know was verboten
367311,everyone knew you never talk about shareholders or dividends or allocating funds to exchanges or marketing and then 2019 happened where it seems there was a mass amnesia event because you go to the docs of many a crypto project today and you read and we will distribute dividends
367312,this is a completely different story than the act of applying to an exchange being interpreted as promising value in futureetc
367313,its all mutually inclusive
367314,it wasnt previously
367315,wasnt it i remember projects prior to 2019 being very tightlipped on the matter because of fear of getting rekt by the sec
367316,thats why people still dont talk about announcing intent to apply or things that havent yet happened and this mostly holds true however this isnt regarding just that but the fact something was announced after the fact and they also singled out just simply applying to an exchange
367317,i see far more projects talking about listing on exchanges nowadays than prior to 2019 after the sec started going after projects
367318,nan
367319,even this
367320,insane
367321,theres a difference between before vs after and again theres a difference between talking openly and just simply applying im not aware of the sec nailing anyone specifically by saying you applied for exchange listings at xyz exchangeif someone wants to be a boob and use were applying to exchange guys thats one thing and i dont often see this however retweeting information that has already happened or just applying for an exchange listing is kind of different and i do hope you can see that
367322,also paragraph 156 on page 43
367323,unpopular opinion i suppose but aside from them playing fast and loose with profits from effort of others and profits solely from effort of others not a minor aside to be clear dare i say theres a lot justified in there the tldr to me is are you sure youre not trying to build a business
367324,last paragraph on pg 53first on pg 54 is pretty bad lol
367325,i honestly wouldnt hate a world where projects basically just stick to here is what weve already built and deployed no future promises or crazy obviously unachievable roadmaps maybe an explanation of what the vision is which i think could be done within those params im obviously not saying those rules are good or make sense but the overpromising and underdelivering has been pretty wild
367326,thats basically the sec guidelines for the most part
367327,theres never been a more thorough endorsement of the liquity model lol
367328,hey everyone is there a futures market or some other way to pay for gas fees in advance on ethereum
367329,chi token
367330,you can only long it though
367331,for 1 and 2 it seems to me raising money at all is the problem3 and 4 is surprisingly true they want useless tokens lol
367333,hello guys could you please share websites with testnets and ambassador programs
367334,throughout the relevant period nikhil and ramani repeatedly traded ahead of coinbase listing announcements trading in at least 25 tokens as alleged in greater detail below each of the nine crypto asset securities were offered and sold by an issuer to raise money that would be used for the issuers business these hallmarks of the definition of a security continue to be true for the nine crypto asset securities that are the subject of the trading in this complaintsure would love to know the 16 that made it out alive lol
367336,this is just a ridiculous catch22 list in a dao there is no central party to vet all communications to catch all this stuff and nobody can see what all contributors do everyone tries to bring something to the table based on their own understanding of the daos mission its expected some of this understanding might be misguided or even hurt the dao see people pulling makerdao in different directions for exampleother points are similarly ludicrous trying to fit completely opposite views into a single thing sec doesnt even bother to define which should be their job not harassing children theyve done a terrible job with this space so far setting the us decades back while the innovators from all other parts of the world are taking over
367337,
367338,at least i have reading material for the next wee while
367339,well they are called securities and exchange commission to them everything will seem like a security
367340,
367341,quick question pls is there a cmccoin market cap like platform for web3 stuff ie what the project do founders tokens vesting schedules etc
367342,coingecko
367344,gamestop has overtaken coinbase in terms of nft sales coinbase is a stupid failure
367345,those two are more for coins im referring broadly nog necessarily they have a tokencoins more like a wikipedia for crypto projects with few more functions
367347,hahaha damn man holy shit that sucks tbh i thought it was user error but props to you for catching it

367363,very nice update
367364,gm frends could you give me some recommendations where could i look in search of projects for web2web3 team we work with evm and eos currently a bit down on the workload
367365,i have a need that i wasnt very sure how to approach it correctly then i realized its the topic for this chati may end selling an offchain digital asset i own and i will need some sort of escrow while i havent used any i know some projects like keep3r that allows people to get the compensation according the job made i also know some things like bisq where there are coins frozen as collateral until the settlement is doneso the questionsuggestion goes is there any universal defi escrow where the buyer amount is frozen until bothall parties somehow sign a yes all went smooth and if everything didnt go smooth some kleros type mechanism or other but as an example kicks in to judge if someone is scamming the other
367366,on the centralisation point would that also cover multisig operations ie does it matter to sec whether centralisation equals core team or just any small group of people with potential decisionmaking power
367367,i did find multisig mentions per se only the team major vote in terms of their governance criticisms did you apeir99n
367368,keeper does onchain automated jobs not like a fiverr what you are suggesting is just regular escrow why do you even mention defi that any trusted party can perform you are introducing too many complexities with some kleros and other type of things telegram handle is not onchain just keep in mind that i believe a new owner cant change the owner again the same day and needs 7 days to change again if they do nothave 2fa on
367369,i mention defi because defi means decentralized finance and not only coin buying
367370,and the day will come where devs will have to focus on more bridging than inter chain bridging and not everything is in a blockchain or a database
367371,so a simple universal escrow is convenient
367372,could just use a multisig wallet
367373,but what you are mentioning has nothing with onchain unless you introduce some rep protocol where then your stake is slashed if the court says you did not do the work cute
367374,also thanks sir i know the requirement for changing ownership of a groupchannel applies only indeed if the soon to be former owner has taken care of these things but if they do then the change is immediate and final
367375,i know thats why i reworded to off chain digital asset and to be honest the fact of being digital is irrelevant because i could be selling a horse and signing that i indeed transferred it physically to the new owner and attach some nft of the photo with the buyer as proof or of the irl contract or both or whatever convenient actually not a good example because being irl i could check irl too if the buyer transferred the funds but being digital and in other country even i cannot check there
367376,complex but makes sense
367377,thats why i brought bisq to the table because the buyerssellers there use cash too and thats a totally off chain thing but they do have their ways to make it secureish and bisq is defi too
367378,even if not in a evm
367379,its not clear if interpreted broadly everything can be called group of people even ethereum development is made by group of people as well as any other protocol
367380,added some nuance
367381,is there any spreadsheet i can find the list of daos ie peopledao
367382,
367383,is the usdd yield mostly subsidies or am i missing something
367384,its basically a copy of the ustluna model draw your own conclusions as to risk
367385,here ser
367386,
367387,farm42 maybe
367388,from tfazhu said that the boat was bought over a year ago and commissioned to be built and to be used in europe while adding the yacht has a full money traillol
367389,what are you trying to do hedge gas volatility for high volume of txs
367390,
367391,uniswap labs has always done an exceptional job at this good counsel
367392,thanks coine_r will read in more detail
367395,no
367396,there are a few projects working on different solutions for this yes
367397,
367398,any free version of ti
367399,not necessarily high volume rather to have the possibility of calculating fixed costs today
367400,any names besides chigastoken
367401,gastoken is worthless
367402,it doesnt work post berlin
367403,you mean the bbg article
367404,if you put your browser into incognito mode and go to the link it might work
367405,archive dot is
367407,the fuck
367408,illuminati conformed
367409,weiward was working on this but i think its kinda ded
367410,
367411,
367414,
367415,anyone find it strange kucoin announced a 10m raise after raising 150m in may
367417,when was this announced
367418,this morning
367419,got it
367420,apparently for strategic reasons sig one of the largest quantitative trading firms kucoin and sig will jointly support promising crypto startups through incubation investment and consultation especially the projects built on the kcc chain capital will also support kucoins global expansion and hiring plan kucoin has 300 job openings to be filledprevious raise in may 2022 kucoin raised 150 million led by jump crypto through a preseries b round bringing its total investments to 170 million with round a combined at a total valuation of 10 billion
367421,yep
367422,super sus almost smells of insolvency
367423,but then again 10m is nothing in terms of withdrawals
367424,name checks out doubt it though they just raised 150m two months ago
367427,just because they raised less in a later round it doesnt mean they are insolvent sometimes you wantneed strategic partners to have skin on the game
367429,would you or anyone you know be interested in hedging gas price if you could
367430,or moreso should ask how badely do you want a futures market on it
367431,just earn more money what problem
367432,mostly makes sense for protocols who contnuously spend and exchanges and miners
367433,ahh makes sense didnt see who the investor was
367434,are there formulas to determine the optimum size for a uniswap v2 lp pool for a lowcap project taking into consideration that a bigger pool requires more to move the marketopen to v3 formulas too thanks
367435,optimum wrt what criteria
367436,a protocol doing a twap gas price perp on arbitrum launched like a week ago but its mostly in a testing phase and the exchange is pretty low liq for now
367437,i guess factors that need to be considered are whether it supports the needs of token holders ie1 incentives to retain liquidity2 whether buyerssellers are happy with slippage
367439,carroteth covers this a bit the contract acts like an escrow and releases funds on satisfying a condition the oracle is currently realityeth but we are working towards accepting different oracles for different usecases
367440,hey use swapreth to incentivise ur community to add liquidity dm me if u are interested
367442,can you share name
367445,looks dead indeed but thanks
367446,yes its about hedging gas prices for future specific transactions a crypto newbie friend of mine wants to buy some tokens on dexes and lock in future transaction costs to hedge against volatile bull market gas prices
367447,interesting piece on defi risk
367448,i see hope to see you growing then i believe theres lots of potential on that
367452,safxxyz
367454,
367455,where do you see this twap gas prixe
367456,the price for gasperp is the gweidenominated trailing 24hour gas price twap
367459,
367460,i was just banned from the bancor telegram chat for inquiring about three large withdrawals that happened all within the last 24 hours if you look at the from accounts on each all of those accounts were originally funded via tornado cash literally the 2 largest eth lp and the largest btc lp just left in the past 24 hours i asked whether those accounts could possibly be from the bancor foundation and was immediately banned from their telegram groupsomething fishy is going on with bancor liquidity is leaving fast check the withdrawals here check the withdrawal transactions here
367461,sers silicon valley is no more
367462,
367463,actually isnt it better if some people leave and agree to take a cut it reduces the protocol deficit
367464,creepto315 just read through the bancor banter they wont stop posting this in response instead of addressing questions head on overall this situation just keeps getting worse and it seems with celsius in ch11 and already done a bunch of withdrawals the imminent threat is not as large they really should just turn ilp back on death spiral and rebuild pivot at this point
367465,posting anything that insinuates nefarious activity unless theres proof isnt allowed john such actions will not be tolerated regardless of who they are directed at
367466,no mysten solana aptos the colleges and the capital are still there
367467,rather silicon valley is expensive to stay in maybe someone could invent the next big thing but they cant because they are priced out of expensive properties and rent there
367468,defo not cheap
367469,when i see amazix moderating a project telegram group instant leave lol
367471,borderline armchair legal question here has anyone seen any litigation daos yet i mean with a number of scamsmoney grabs in this space wouldnt that be a valid case for a dao to form comprised of participants who want to take a legal route against fraudstersconmen like a class action dao or whatever
367472,do you mean something different similar than initial litigation offering ilo
367473,
367474,gabriel shapiro has a great thread on it
367475,is there also a manner to see any twap buying of certain coins
367477,i dont know what ilo is there may or may not be a token at all for this probably can issue an nft or even soulbound token new usecase vitalik which would represent a share in litigation proceedsoutcome
367478,yeah so why wouldnt a dao be formed around similar cases
367480,
367481,
367483,gm sers can anyone recomend a good onchain data analyst course ive control fd but cant see anything specific
367485,have you tried
367486,thanks im looking at it now looks as if i should have sql knowledge already i was looking for beginer level as im a simp but i understand etherscan etc
367487,actually i see the recomended sql courses in the comments
367488,youre gonna need at least basic scripting knowledge to do anything meaningful tbh
367489,damn ok well im determined so is there a beginer level you can recomend
367490,if you want write something just start doing this and youll find all the answers in the google this is the way people learn programming and remember if you have some troubles then someone else have had it before you so the answer is always in the google
367491,thanks ser
367492,orbital resonance made me think of stablecoins and other defi mechanisms is it a good analogy
367493,yeah theres been a trend towards increasing censorship in the bancor tg mentioning foundation bailout has become taboo and no transparency at all with regards to the 100m they raised during their ico wouldnt be surprised if they somehow squandered it like celsius and 3ac
367494,i think it would be better if you wait for their official statements regarding the matter and not speculateanyhow just withdraw your funds or not deposit into bancor
367495,its hard not to speculate when the foundation goes dead silent since il protection was turned off they provide zero transparency into the funds and the team are giving all the same written responses on how the bancor foundation has nothing to do with the bancor dao their sole purpose is to fund protocol development however thats not the case when you look at all their snapshot voting the bancor foundation used to vote yes and no on certain proposals more recently they have been voting abstain but those abstain votes were a bit like wolf in sheeps clothing in that without those abstain votes many of those proposals would not have met quorum
367496,hey anyone know of a way to get a list of all testnet faucet addresses has anyone published anything like that
367497,faucetparadigmxyz
367498,yes ive seen the paradigm one before but thats just paradigm specific faucets no
367499,but yeah thats exactly what im looking for
367500,if you have any issues just lmk also i made this before dune abstractions repo was a thing
367501,an alternative is to use graphql and jupyter notebooks
367502,this is really sort of a red herring
367503,in practice unless they are day trading the transaction costs are not significantly volatile to require a hedge due to price volatility typically 1015 events per year see prices exceed a 3 std dev swing
367504,what they should be wanting to hedge instead is transaction inclusion that is where the risk actually is in not price per se
367505,transaction inclusion risk as an example would be a user unable to add additional collateral to a loan position by a certain block thus getting liquidated
367506,whereas pricing risk for a transaction can be outbid inclusion in limited block space may or may not be entirely price reflective
367507,perfect as im starting from scratch it seems ill have to learn how to use either two or sql first i found this for a starter package
367508,hey lobster fam i hope my new article will help some of you as a lot of users are currently on apple devices
367509,
367510,i dont think the issue with options is pricing
367511,we used to be a society
367512,missing those days
367513,what a time to be alive that was
367515,guys hi please tell me if there is any project or tool that automates the work with liquidity in v3 pools moves it to the desired range with a certain frequency for example
367516,it is one of the major problems ser
367517,arakis from gelato
367518,arrakis finance is the largest also xtoken terminal gamma strategies
367519,thanks guys love this chat
367520,sure buddy
367521,i think it will get clearer with 2nd part of this research which we will release next weekalso please do let us know if you liked this part would be happy to hear feedbackssuggestions
367522,also charmfi
367523,hey feel free to dm me about this im from gamma and we run automated rebalancing strategies based on certain rebalance triggers that work for you
367538,just out of curiosity is it possible to create something like gpt3 or dalle on the blockchain using decentralized processors like render or something if not what are the obstructions
367539,decentralised data storage and processing power is magnitudes more expensive
367540,the models are hundreds of gb if not more
367541,like if we were to adjust for costs what are the other infrastructural deficiencies blockchain has when it comes to creating similar models
367542,i think maybe in 100s of tbs
367543,depends on what you want tbhdecentralized model training decentralized execution
367544,you can look up federated learning for some ways of doing the training part
367545,open source code with decentralized processing and incentives for data or knowledge providers
367547,theres alrdy open source models you can train
367548,as well as open data sets
367549,ig you could set up a market to get more training data but a perdatum evaluation of how useful it is to model training seems like it would at best greatly increase your training time
367550,i think even dalle and codexgithub copilot are trained on open source data sets
367551,decentralized processing what does that mean a different service provider runs the model each time
367552,something like render
367553,sry im not familiar can you link
367554,
367556,honestly idk if theres a need for such a decentralized model just thinking out loud
367557,has that ever stopped projects
367558,im not familiar enough with the economics but can someone comment on if their pricing is competitive with aws
367559,which projects
367560,dentacoin
367561,any projects that try to do xyz on the blockchain
367562,we are going to put all of your medical records on the blockchain so you can own your own data
367563,yeah thinking on the lines of this only
367564,but at the same time such a design gives you the leverage to donate your data to research anonymously while earning incentives
367565,this for ex
367566,where is the decentralized
367567,this seems rly far fetched nglavg price for individual user data prolly in the centsnot sure commodifying it will lead to higher prices
367568,reads like a runofthemill render farm business with some token
367569,i think anyone can leverage their gpu to their network but yeah not permissionless
367570,research labs spend thousands of to get data sometimes but yeah not every kind of data is going to be highly priced i am mostly focused on utility here
367571,you wouldnt call aws decentralized just because any can use it if they follow the rules would you
367572,can you set up a gpu setup for aws
367573,thats not the point of the analogy
367574,maybe i framed it wrong
367575,back to the origin q at hand i think that decentralized model training is still in its infancyyou pay more in compute and the results are often less competitivethis is on top of the models themselves being quite large and the compute scale being very largeso youd need very high requirements for nodes and the end result wouldnt rly be much better
367576,yeah just wanted to discuss about the points of failure if such a system is created onchain
367577,also for this the decentralization is wrt your servers anyone can provide their gpus for rendering where not a single entity is controlling the network but yeah infra of specific protocols can be debated
367578,unless theyre hiding something a single entity is definitely controlling this network business
367582,for those interested to learn more about whats going on in decentralized science can rec this recent talk by juan benet and ethereum explainer
367583,
367585,
367586,audius community treasury was hacked
367587,for how much
367589,1856449781999999 audio tokens at 03 like 6m
367591,damn another one
367592,1kk
367593,good deal
367594,
367595,
367598,this is actually really interesting with the 23andme hack something like this is actually needed
367599,the fine print under our policies is definitely interesting
367600,whats the best dev resources for aptos
367601,anything specific
367605,if metamask wants to make you sign a set approval for all nft transaction eg on gem is there a way to see doublecheck on which nft contract it is calling that function before sending the transaction
367606,pls is there a way to recover a lost google authenticator account any one
367608,2fa may be stored in a cloud backup of the device icloudgoogledrive device backup i dont know any other ways unfortunatelyby the way your cloud backup copy is not protected in the same way as the data on your phone if we are talking about requests from the gov orgs and so on thats a good thing to remember
367609,thanks
367610,as far as im concerned google authentificator unfortunately for our case stores data only locally but i havent used ios for the last 4 years so i may be wrong
367611,this is correct afaik only app settings are icloud backed the keys are locally stored and you can as of recently export qr codes for manual backups you have some chances of restoring if you still have access to the old device
367612,yeah i know but i dont have access to my old devicethat why i asked for help here
367613,here is dunes shortlist of good resources which i agree are all good
367615,just like in tradfi traders prefer trading delta neutral options strategies purely betting on vol pre and post event earinngs etc im seeing in crypto there are more such events token unlocks airdrops etc are there any dov products selling events bassed short straddlesstrangles anyone knows crypto funds trading this strategy on deribiti or have seen such patterns on paradigm otc thanks
367616,yes several out there eg qcp
367617,these are deep otm more focused on theta decay i guess looking for something like this also do you agree with the premise that 1 such events are more in crypto 2 these events actually have as much vol impact as equity earning events do
367618,deribit only can trade btc eth and sol optionsso whatever you typed isnt much applicable except to sol dov are priced to whatever the mms need unlocks can be straight away used for liquid staking and locked up
367619,i dont think crypto option markets are that sophisticated yet we basically have good liquidity for only btc and eth and iv from what im seeing is mostly reactive not proactive there isnt really an equivalent of earnings in crypto
367620,we are going to build ilbased straddlesstrangles though so if you care about trading these events it might become interesting
367621,ohh nice i also had the same issue that liqudity mostly exists for btc eth but there are not many events or predictable vol shocks with those 2 however there are many in long tail tokens so was thinking of ways to pull off a short atm straddle like payoff via uni v3 lp positions in the usdc pair of that token
367622,whats your checklist for sophistication
367623,yeah were going for uni v2 first makes the liquidity much more available basically we assume that amm lps are already selling vol so buyers can leveraged buy that il to turn it into a straddle as a seller you can also go into a leveraged short
367624,i think iv responding to events vix fed fomc would be a good sign of sophistication ive traded options a bit in this period only times iv rose was when rv had a squeeze already
367625,no of option trading providers no of assets that one can trade options on types of collateral
367626,consistent iv across top 23 cexs and dexs at least for cash settled options of top 20 token pairs by tvl in their uni pools
367627,i think you guys underestimate how little people care about options
367628,speak for yourself
367629,but in uni v2 you cant decide the strikes right coz there are no limit orders as such
367630,just making a market for sol is hard to do
367631,we have such a long way to go if you expect liquid options for like 20 defi tokens lmao
367632,so if you try to fit the il gamma and delta curves to existing options you get option strikes that are about 20 otm and monthly expiry options
367633,which is why andrey said that the option markets in crypto arent sophisticated
367634,the central point is the price of when you open the position
367635,i think sophisticated is the wrong word
367636,got it
367637,mature
367638,agree that v3 gives more flexibility eventually well want to do concentrated too
367639,ya better plenty of sophisticated players just less people covered in cheeto dust punting btc options from their couch less external unpredictable events to try and price iv in a strange way crypto is somewhat boring
367640,less unknowns less volume less opportunity
367641,theres some education to do for surefor example if you trade perps with 34x leverage you can just sell options and get same returns the massive theta funding rate
367642,eh
367643,only reason to trade options is if you have an outlook on iv
367644,id say more unknowns tho
367645,if you dont you should be trading perps
367646,my point is that if you accept liquidations on your perps youd easily accept it on options too
367647,as a seller you dont care how fast the price goes somewhere so iv is more like a nice bonus
367648,deribit is really shitty for the retail trader tho no stop losses except for the apis
367649,and every other place doesnt have liquidity
367653,ive ditched google authenticator in favor of authy imho strictly better app and i can use it simultaneously on several devices for free
367654,it cringes me enormously when some shitty web2 service forces to use sms as 2fa
367655,otpauth is even better but asymmetrical keys are strictly better thank totp where the server also knows your secret use yubikey when possible
367656,if your phone is a rooted android you can access the 2fa seeds but unlikely to apply for most people
367657,there are many reasons to buy an atm call over longing a perp if you want to just bet on the direction too1 hedged downside no liquidation2 added benefit of long gamma if you get the timing right too
367658,vasa_dev ser any reason why the gem bulk sender is an unverified contract
367659,never understood the whole no liquidation thing no difference between me making a sub account with 100 and putting 100 on a atm option
367660,your long gamma until your not the leverage is almost the exact same with perps
367661,diff is that your sub account if it hits your stops youre done on an option you have until it expires to be rightif youre betting like 10x leverage and more this is a godsend
367662,yep it boils down to leverage and money management felxibility you get with the 100 via both instruments
367663,thats true but your paying for that flexibility
367664,imo most people fall in love with options for the wrong reason
367665,agree with that coz to learn it the right way you need collateral money and learning the wrong way is cheaper than perps i guess
367666,crypto as an asset class needs short vol instruments trying to picture the right trigger points of how thatll happen
367667,agree you still need to be very tactical about your buys
367668,surely this a joke right
367669,alfa vault does it nicely creates an abstraction over v3 to make it as easy to manage as v2 rebalancing the position and saving on fees
367671,is also noteworthy
367672,be careful with the sms otp restore option cause you can be targeted by sim swap attacks
367675,how so ser
367676,ok this is kinda embarrassingbut i opened an option on aco auctus protocol some point last year on arbitrum going over my accounts it took ages to find out wtf that token named aco eth3500usdcc17sep210800utc even was eventually i figured out its that weird thing that i aped into last year good so lets twitter search that something about approve exploit shit quickly revokecash ed that but i hadnt approved anything so seems ok twitter says for all updates follow auctusproject easy but this account doesnt exist fuck rektanyone here who knows if how to get something out there is still possible or who wants to engage on a lost treasure hunt
367677,kinda needless to say the app doesnt really work anymore
367678,im delving into lending protocol breakdown found a few resources on compound but cant find aave euler and rari fuse any pointers
367679,what are you looking for in particular aave has pretty thorough documentation
367680,care to send contracts ser i know nothing about auctus but would like to take a look
367681,sure this is the pool for the optionsand this is the option token
367682,i really appreciate this hildobby you my good ser are a true gent tips hat then replaces monocle
367683,of course happy to help
367684,hello everybody i just launched a creative storytelling competition on tezos if you like analog photography and creative writing go visit the page to know more
367685,is this serious comment or
367686,its encrypted by your restore password
367687,does this seem odd to anyone
367688,otter account has been engagement farming for weeks that account seems to be a troll or malicious pleb dunno what is what ignore it moving forward imho
367689,just today the account is suspended for good
367690,yes but i can understand anyone who feels they are put into a position to feel the need to speak out on something directly or if there is something happening possibly unrelated to the issue being fudd about unfortunately it can unintentionally serve to legitimize the other party
367691,well if youre swing trading youre most likely gonna use 34x leverage and take profit after a 1020 gain if you sell atm options you get the same leverage same price targets but youre earning 50100 apr in funding for your positionboth can get liquidated so theres no real risk difference between perps and selling options
367692,options market is mostly bitcoin
367693,there is little to none liquidity for other coins ethereum somewhat but also not matured enough yet
367694,im hearing that options market is going to replace perps for few years but seems like the crypto invented perps are still the most attractive for gamblers
367695,hi how do i know if a token is blacklisted
367696,a token or an address
367697,yeah theyre really hard to market make for imho perps are the gateway drug once you feel their limitations you really wish deribit wasnt so shit and there was liquidity for other coins
367698,shit as a retail trading platform that is
367699,deribit is great for bitcoin options tho
367700,like a usdt token or honeypot token the one scammers use for private keys pishing dms
367701,its coming in due time all the tradfi mms bringing it with them
367702,its the only platform with liquidity ye but the interface is very limiting
367703,nothing is coming shitcoins will still dominate by perps
367704,its a genius derivative
367705,they also provide eth options
367706,bitcoin is still moves mostly by perps too
367707,some research came out a few months ago from carol alexander showing 70 ish of all crypto volatility transmits from the binance btcusdt perp
367708,yeah i mean the impact of options is here for bitcoin surely but nothing there pointing that options will replace perps so far mb with some biggest tardfi like citadel possible but big firms already here too like jump etc
367709,options mostly used for hedging right now by dealers
367710,i think there are good and solvable reasons why this hasnt happened yet it is definitely not easy with tradfi tools
367711,there is huge fundamental flaw in exchanges reporting perps flow both binance and ftx sucks with data
367712,i think its big problem
367713,bitmex unironically was transparent about data
367714,wym
367715,on options you can find outright manual clickable arbitrages in options on defi and some cex the real question is if you can hit the volume and hedge i have observed but not tested personally i didnt see the point as my ansatz is that these orders are honeypots id be interested to know if anyone observed the same tested
367716,bitfinex is just on their own
367717,collateralization terms on defi options are so bad that these arbs might be worth less than risk free rate tbh
367718,they dont report data in real time
367719,but rather update it after like liquidations oi etc
367720,theyre quite wide tbh most of it seems to be dealers not updating regularly and leaving stale prices hanging i just get the feeling it doesnt matter though because the signal transmitted would be enough to compensate
367721,wut where
367722,this is some alpha for nerds but im dumb to execute it
367723,yeah i think options are one of the few things left untapped for arbing
367724,its due to the low amount of people actually using them i guess
367725,deribit vs bybit both looked quite out of sync last time i checkedi was refreshing both pages on two screens and saw a lot of differences it took a while to find something that didnt lead to annoying errors and negative yields
367726,is it solvable though i feel ike the biggest issue is overcollaterisation
367727,i think the issue is the volumes are nonexistent and the market participants on options market making are extremely sophisticated so if you start taking their lunch it wont be for long
367728,youd need credit lines to really break into the real power of options for consumergrade covered options i really think you need fnfts and a good marketplace
367729,ah thought you meant defi cex arb
367730,not a surprise bybit on their own planet even with perps their liquidation engine works completely differently from others hence apes there liquidated first as prices surge with premium every single time
367731,yeah i found that too but it was wider in defi cex so i didnt use for my analysis in that post as it made the analysis look so bad
367732,but thats just because i hate the proprietary nature of current option marketplaces the vaults are neat but in many cases theyre often highly centralized
367733,were working on making a limited form of options where you only need to supply interest rates as collateral
367734,only works with straddlesstrangles but its a start
367735,interesting you and i should talk were building out resonate which we expect will produce a large supply of liquid interestrate exposures
367736,how would that work where would you take the benchmark interest rate from
367737,i presume your solution requires principal
367738,its based on il you can fairly easily build a delta neutral long gamma position that only pockets the il and cant be liquidated by anything but the interest rate which simulates theta
367739,the real bumper would be to provide swaps with collateralisation in a choice of stablecoins the biggest issue for insti is the peg risk if you can provide exposure to a fixed interest rate without requiring collateral in the same stablecoins it could be very interesting
367740,we definitely want to make interests market based
367741,you mean purchasing the rights to interest streams in stables yeah thats a part of what weve built
367743,blz enough w the shilling
367744,its always very organic but nah
367745,shvandrew shot you a dm to keep ivan happy
367746,mates need your help cant login to yearn it says install metamask but mm is already installed and updated

367772,thank you
367773,
367774,1m a month is pretty substantial
367776,who would be losing this 1m each month and will this hurt sushi swap as a whole as less people would be using it or it would just stop the users that were profiting the 1m so not actually hurt sushiswap
367777,proposal capture mev by frontrunning the foldsushi backrunning botsprofit idk i didnt read the full proposal
367778,interesting how they calculated the effect of 1m monthlyas i see in proposal they would only target swaps occuring with sushi guard private rpc of sushi after that bot would access private mempool of sushi and execute arb this way fold finance bot has advantage to other botsis profit calculated in a situation where everyone just trades using sushi guard
367779,fold finance actually got a pretty good deal out of that proposal they are basically allowed to arbitrage sushi swap occured in sushi guard mode without any competitors and they have 50 of the revenue from such arbitrage
367780,the profit is split 5050 between fold holders the manifold finance token and the sushi community its up to sushi what they do with it the original idea last year was to give gas rebates to the users of sushi but it could be anything give it for gas rebates or to xsushi holders or anything sushi wants
367781,the new router is not live yet the proposal passed but it should be implemented in the next few days
367782,the only people hurt will be the bots that currently arb and mev sushi transactions in the public mempool who wont be able to do that anymore all sushi transactions will be mev protected by default kind of like cowswap by going through the securerpc rpc so it benefits all sushi users and transactions the only mev sushiguard does is back running to make profits basically arbitrage between dexes after sushi users complete trades this doesnt hurt sushi users sushiguard does not do front running of sushi transactions which would hurt sushi users thats the tradeoff for the benefit of integration with sushi and capturing back running from all sushi transactions its very winwin
367783,wait all sushi transactions will be mev protected by default is it where can i read more about it that seems quite a ux change for sushi
367784,oh also note the revenue estimate is from the manifold team and it includes gas savings from using securerpc etc i think thats about 30 of the estimate which wont be actual cash revenue but the range is so wide because this is notoriously hard to estimate and depends on a bunch of different variables
367785,theres not much theres bits and pieces on the manifold finance site and tweets and documentation on the openmev and securerpc sites run by manifold i picked it up by hanging around the manifold telegram oh and theres been quite a few tweets by sushi in the last few months about sushiguard the older version of this same feature which needed you to opt in and gave errors when you used ledgers etc this is an updated version which should automatically capture all sushi transactions without any of that hassle
367788,pretty cool
367791,
367792,what do u guys think is tyler ward a scammer or just adhd founder
367793,as a fellow founder im struggling putting my creative energy into more than 2 projects at the same time
367794,especially if one of them is needing a lot of attention switching between so many will not be productive at all
367795,he has at least 5
367796,this so just the usual serial entrepreneur doing 100 online businesses at once not a scam though they never believe in one thing enough so they print coins to make money and fuck off hustler type not to be trusted when a founder works on something they love and just diversify via a bit of investing thats fine one can manage that a few bags they create as serial businesses nah is shit
367797,also every previous token is farming the new one lol
367799,we all smelled weird stuff from tyler in here from day 0 though too much blabla again not a scammer maybe a good person maybe they have decent ideas but it smells of devshop vibes and lobsters are not devshop people idk
367800,lol obvious ponzi skem
367802,i think diversifying and doing other stuff makes total sense when the previous projects reached maturity doesnt seem to be the case here tho
367803,no maturity at best they have a demo version of the projects lol
367804,there are much worse actors though and he seems to build something and then gives it to others is oook but wouldnt drink together
367805,dunno somehow for me a person who literally rugs is more honest than someone who is scamming in the open like this
367806,like a bandit who robs you in the wild west versus some kind of person who promises you gold but instead impoverishes your whole family
367807,slow rugscam is still a scam wouldnt separate it into 2 baskets its just a different strategy
367808,ye they both equally suck tbh
367809,can i ask what is meant by devshop
367810,nan
367811,second this
367812,slowsoft rug is the worst
367813,feeding ppl hopes is just disgusting
367814,external development agency usually you hire them for one off development needs needless to say this looks real bad for a serious defi project
367815,if the vision and mission the participants should not care if the team is shipping with internal team or external one tbh hiring is better nowadays but theres still a big gap when it comes to developers not to even touch on the costs aspect
367816,how advanced can your vision ever be if youre relying on an external team to do it
367817,to be fair i can see off sourcing some minor aspect to dev shops think bridge interfaces or farming stuff idkcore protocol should never be outsourced tho
367818,agree outsourcing core competencies seems somewhat odd to me
367819,does anyone has yearn vault contract written by solidity
367820,
367821,hope you guys like it
367822,is cool
367823,glad you like it mate
367824,team worked hard on it
367825,hey bneiluj do you control rekthq account if so could you please help me with something ive been waiting for a customs refund of 8 eur from them for 3 months already could you please contact someone and perhaps bump up the case its not about the 8 euro is about the fact that theyve stated several times theyll cover the cost but 3 months have passed and they still kicking the can down the road thx in advance for your time
367826,last 10th june they said theyd queue the transaction that day and still waiting today for it
367827,once again an amazing video the music is legit good
367828,does anyone have a messari enterprise account by any chancetrying to get access to this article
367829,i will send you the text of the article
367830,you all should take advantage of the currently super cheap fees
367831,me 2
367833,what i hate from messary and theblock subs modelsits ok for me to pay 50 eth fees for txbut i cant manage to pay from credit card or login with emailwhy no metamask login pay with crypto
367834,yes you can bypass it easily with a plugin
367836,download a plugin no need to pay there you go
367837,nan
367838,can you please add this doc to google docs thanks
367839,just import it in docsgooglecom

367848,
367849,12ft too
367850,i hope no one from messari here is reading these messages
367851,is there a votium for aurora
367852,this tweet is like 1010
367853,if you mean aura
367854,who is entering now
367855,is there any tool to compare univ3 trading fee aprs between evms on the same pools ie usdceth 005 on polygon ethereum optimism
367856,try this
367857,revertfinance has this tool
367858,the initiator
367859,
367860,it also allows to simulate your position
367861,ah so basically digital agency types
367862,copy pasta factories
367863,
367864,soooooo ico ideas 2017
367865,good job kiddo no
367866,
367867,beef on the blockchain
367868,
367871,hey frens is there any handy tool to query the worth of a uniswap nft given its token id
367872,ah nevermind found it
367873,i think its readable from the contract right
367874,hey wondering about projects that store addresses in a db and how you can mixed vs lowercasedo you either lowercase everything or use case insensitive search each time
367875,using postgres specifically in my case
367876,i guess postgres trigger to auto lowercase could work we already lower case on the unique indexes
367877,still annoying for queries feel like this shouldnt be this annoying to handle
367878,row level triggers are not good usecase if you care about performanceadd a check constraint and change wherever you save data from
367879,for rust projects you usually have to create an intermediate type which which serves as a binding between your code and the db so the code is stored in the dbs native type and your code can translate it
367880,ya i guess this is what well do and have done till now but annoying
367882,we write as checksum addresses and always query as checksum addresses
367883,it gets hard when you deal with values that are not certain to be an address like topics in logs
367884,
367887,hi guys i find some famous bridge aggregator w public api any recommend
367888,otpauth is even better authyautificator is otp no totp to be exact that is hotp from timestamp
367889,ive diched youbekey in favor to authy as well due to versatiliy simplicity and that fact how easy is to have several devices for redundancy
367890,ah you probably meant specific app named otpauth my bad
367891,yes i meant this app
367892,and 1password is even better
367893,also if you already have a yubikey it supports totp auth too on top of yubiotp u2f pgp blah blah
367894,you can add your existing totpgoogle authenticatoretc codes into your yubikey and generate totp codes without having the totp secrets leave the yubikey
367895,if you have an nfc yubikey you can get codes on your or someone elses android or ios phone too
367896,authy is pretty shitty app
367898,yeah and they dont improve it if you have a lot of apps there it just freezes every time you open it
367899,i use separate android device with no internet access and aegis open sourced app it has a good functionality and back up without emails and shit like that
367900,if you have 2fa codes on the phone with a lot of apps you are doing it wrong in first place
367901,seems like he mightve meant a lot of accounts
367902,hm ok then i didnt experience any freezing tbh not many accounts there but try to transfer data from authy to new device you will be out for a surprise and it doesnt allow you to retrieve the original code while aegis does for example which is very convenient
367903,smart would you always use a separate android device as a password storage or a pen and paper or whats your go to
367904,keypass ofc
367905,on your current computer
367906,separately stored on encrypted usb stick with back up on another usb stick
367907,making things too complicated will make you loose shit some day
367908,thats how i lost some of my online accounts too much complicated opsec
367909,yep that happened to me when i was overcomplicating my security you have to find the right balance for you and a good organization system
367910,i would suggest for everything to create a visualization mindmap maybe or write down where your stuff is but for security you cant really do that
367911,but authy has been good have their been any hacks on authy
367912,i dont think it would matter by default all authy 2fa account tokens are stored locally
367913,the only problem is by default authy allows any mobile device with access to the phone number associated to the authy account to download and access the private keys for that account so if somebody uses social engineering to access your phone could be a problem if you dont change the settings
367914,i think that option can be disabled
367915,yes it can i said by default
367916,what i did was install authy on my iphone and android
367917,so if one of those goes missing i will find another phone to install it on
367918,so one is a backup of the other
367919,might need to dig for a better solution though i like the yubikey idea up there
367920,i dont really use authy so im not of much help others might know better but that generally sounds good
367921,yea im researching yubikey rn
367922,so whats the best authenticator among all
367923,authy is convenient carrying a yubikey around is not
367924,im using both authy and yubikey
367925,authy for stupid account yubikey for important acc google twitter etc
367926,what do you call overcomplication i mentioned pretty simple basic opsec with nothing special
367927,i think best is to see a list of the top recommended then at that point sometimes its just preference also it depends how secure you really want to be by adding separate layers like early mentioned with using a separate android w no internet connection
367930,is there any specific reason people prefer to fork compound and not aave
367931,good day sers anyone knows if there is any place to look tags for wallets in btc network for example in etherscan you can see a tag connecting the wallets to binance or other big accounts
367932,idk if anyone here will have the answer for preference but i would suggest looking at the top forked protocols on compound vs aave and find the common variables
367933,breadcrumbs
367934,thanks just what i needed
367935,what are other options of storing seed phrase aside from paper
367936,tbh knowing myself ill sooner lose the paper back up than someone hacks into my icloudgoogle drive and so on
367937,multiple pieces in multiple different places helps
367938,does anyone have opinion on storing seed phrase in 1password what about encryption software eg password gated folder on flash drive
367939,anything but paper so impractical
367940,not a bad idea
367941,what i like to do could also put somewhere and keep the coordinates on a g drive etc in an encrypted format
367942,
367943,just use google for such stuff
367945,this is a very general google question sers
367958,3 weekly mutes for garbage jokes redacted
367959,where are you sourcing this from
367960,compound code is much simpler and easier to fork
367961,defillama
367962,was always skeptical about helium but this ser explained the model very well
367963,this guy is a web 2 larp moron though even though the thread is not too bad
367964,the netowkring p2p layer etc stuff is very close to regular businesses is hard stuff
367965,and i tbh do not understand those tcpip stuff
367966,good to know his biases but objectively speaking he has a point crux of most web2 folks argument is revenue is generally token incentives and as token incentives decline so does revenuethat is okay it is to be figured by dd by customers and vcs and if they didnt then its their bad web3 marketing has taken financialisation in that all of a sudden you can give because the underlying hnt is traded somewhere its the same thing airbnb was trying to do a while back giving shares to leasors on their product most of these arguments dont hold up for defi ventures where revenue is from onchain activity
367967,its just a general your industry is early criticism
367968,and they putting data points together to prove you are a filthy bear pleb
367969,let him run more facebook ads for obesity supplements scam products pleb fucker
367970,yea it gets traction in a bear market so
367971,ye so nothing new pleb larp moving on
367972,idk if helium is good tho
367973,thats for hnt holders to figure out theres 4k tokens in the market its buyers beware
367974,not my monkey not my circus
367977,favorite quote of the week hands down
367978,one of the interesting comments
367979,compounds code base is easier to reason about
367980,looks like lora has a lot of limitations kek
367981,kurma my wallet is bleeding
367982,haha
367983,i love how he knew it was crap bought it anyway and then made decent money
367993,this is for kingdom
367994,we do not trade here
368001,hey anyone here active in the refi space
368002,regulated finance or what
368003,maybe real estate
368004,to be fair this is widely disclosed by them and can easily be found even through basic diligence their target market for lora is smart cities agriculture water utilities and iot devices their system will work for 4g and 5g as well the problem is that there is no open spectrum frequency anyone can use available in most countries for those and itll be a heavy regulatory lift to get that approved once it is though they can easily expand into that vertical without commenting on the valuation of helium and if its a good or bad price at that buy im very long term bullish on bootstrapped hardware networks theyve accomplished incredible coverage already even in a lesser value spectrum and keep pushing ahead
368005,regenerative financecarbon credits and carbon offsets
368008,you can thrust the man blursed he knows a lot about this topic
368009,i usually only take the investment advice from ivan that is do exactly the opposite
368010,i can confirm this is the right strategy since he bought gold i suffered a massive loss
368011,compound iii is out soon tm took a deep dive into it in our latest state of defi lending newsletter issue plus an interview with compound labs vp engineering jared flatow commentsquestions are welcome
368012,someone uses it is not clear on the site whether access to researches free or not
368015,
368016,dunno how true it is but i remember the talks maerak group and ibm having failed to psuh their platform because supply chain actors were not on the level playing field then but looks like these guys just made up their own blockchain anyway sigh for them it was always marketing and clout anyway though i guess not the actual value transfer
368017,ahhhh my vechain coin ahhh s jk
368021,not like their website provide much info but do they settle on ethereum
368022,dont think so to be honest
368023,ive built on hyperlegder before i can confirm its a flaming dumpster fire
368025,thats kinda cute tho
368026,cellarius anyone
368028,sers any chance theres an existing solution to get uniswap v3 historical data cba writing something to extract from archive node mb someone made smth os already
368029,seems to be a scam shilled by new entrants no
368030,i dunno im still in bed i just saw fanfic about a thing and thought it was cute
368031,possibly simplefi
368033,radiant scam
368034,
368035,which evm chains didnt implement the eip1559 theres a list
368036,bsc for sure they call it bip 1559 but its implementation is totally skewed
368037,it can be a mess for front ends who supports multiple evm chains
368038,you can still send type 1 transaction
368039,
368041,nan
368042,any idea what was this crazy active addresses spike around midnight today
368043,hi timur the research is token gated will try to label it more clearly
368044,continuing on ethwe have in general found few interesting things todaythere seem to be specific pattern emerging or rather already emergedcan see here the details
368045,hey
368046,
368047,
368048,someone tried keet the p2p video chat from tether yet
368049,yes its not bad at all might replace gmeets one day
368050,yes its amazing
368052,as explained by stephangoss these are well known lora technically works well for most iot use cases but adoption rates have been poor for different reasons high device density low power usage and long range with low bandwidth has been exploited in some smart cities too
368053,haha yeah i know they never said anything beyond iot applications and stuff but i just didnt know it was because of lora limitations
368054,can you share some examples of the exploit you mentioned
368055,sounds something interesting to read about
368056,need to correct used not exploited in cybersecurity context about 6 cities in india a dozen in greater china and more
368057,got it
368058,lora has a basic free network layer but commercial versions are available which are pretty good the issue is less technology and more market adoption as overall public spaces iot has not been anywhere near predictions
368059,well this is nice info will read about it a bit

368062,is it web based or need to install anything
368063,where can i see it
368064,you need to install a desktop app for now its still alpha version
368065,has anyone made siginficant innovation on the cream finance oracle proxy code is obviously both old and gold wanted to know if anything has been done in the years since
368066,
368070,think the most upto date version is the one iron bank are doing
368071,theyre identical
368073,this was updated more frequently
368074,i mean the priceoracleproxy files are literally identical according to diffchecker thanks tho
368075,sers what did i miss
368076,uniswap on polygon
368077,looks like they listed the price for a maybe scam token
368078,in this case index
368080,in other things anyone looked at the new kyberswap protocol called elasticlooks like a univ3 fork but with very sad fancy features like autocompouding in a full range lp anti jit and more tier fees 0008 004 etc lol
368081,recently stumbled on those docs and lol it reads like bad plagiarism
368082,yeap completely it makes me think haydens thread on jit wasnt a coincidence maybe they saw this one coming
368083,autocompounding its gut imho tho didnt read that part of the docs just the jit part
368084,and adding the 0008 just pushing the race to the bottom and id guess increase gas prices because of tick size
368085,the reinvestment curve is a compoundable constant product curve that supports the price range from 0 to infinity the reinvestment curve is aggregated with the pool so that they maintain a common price while behaving differently price ranges of the pool have different amounts of liquidity which are not affected by exchange activities meanwhile the reinvestment curves liquidity remains the same on all ticks and increases based on the accumulating fee after each swap this part is pretty weird your compounded fees will go into a constant product curve
368086,theyre just saying they put all liquidity accrued from fees into a uni v2 style lp
368087,there are seriously cool ways you could improve on the basic uni v3 design think actual limit orders but i guess kyber gave up or something
368088,auto compounding is useful i guess but really minor if you have gelato
368090,different risks tho not sure which one id prefer lol
368091,
368092,the tdlr is no one bailed out harmony and they are suggesting minting billions of one and compensating users over three years in one valued at 002 usd at the time of the exploit
368093,ie if you had 1k on harmony youd get paid out 50k one over the course of three years for clarity this is only a proposal not what they will do but things certainly dont bode well for harmony
368094,oof
368095,what do yall think of savax being valued at the amount of avax backing it
368096,isnt it risky like valuing gbtc or steth at backing value or different because theres a shorter unlock
368098,unlike gbtcsteth savax can be unstaked today and thus be redeemablegbtc has to wait for regulatorssteth has to wait for merge future unstaking upgrade
368099,unstaking isnt immediate though should that affect pricing
368100,anyone know how amberdata compares to cctxs data sources who has better exchangevenue coverage and whats the frequency its not entirely clear what exchange data is supported on cctx documentation
368101,not sure how savax pool implements it but they can technically split their stake to have rolling unstake periods so at least some can be redeemed over time and minimize that riskmaybe think of it as an unstaking queueno clue how to price that risk though
368102,thinking either by increasing its cdr to match its pricing risk or using a custom oracle to price its depegging in a safe way
368105,another point to consider when compounding fees you expose them to il
368106,what is the best tool to locate private variable storage position within a smart contract etherscan decompile is unusable waiting time of 1190 minutes
368107,what are the major protocols using vyper
368108,curve was one of them im not sure about other big projects
368114,ethberlin hackathon imo the best hackathon is accpeting invites
368118,how would user know that your extensions is safe to use
368119,hi i am trying to understand the few things in eth staking any sources or article to understand why people not thinking beyond lido for eth staking what are the frictions other service providers are currently posing which makes lido the market leader
368120,liquidity moat has an option to borrow against
368121,guys you can dm me and ill tell you thats a good point and i would love to get feedback on how to make users trust us react to this message if you are ok with me contacting you in dm
368123,thanks eylon anyone know a place that curates all upcoming hackathons
368124,does anyone have a website where i can see an overview of blockchain explorers for different chains
368125,
368126,
368128,anyone got that lobster dao job board link handy
368129,
368130,thanks
368131,hi guys i have a question about the metadataof function used by the lobsterdao nft contract hope thats alrightthe function is as followsfunction metadataofuint256 _tokenid public view returns string memory require_tokenid totalsupply invalid_token_id uint256 seed_ seed if seed_ 0 return uint256 memory randomids new uint256maxtokens for uint256 i 0 i maxtokens i randomidsi i for uint256 i 0 i maxtokens 1 i uint256 j i uint256keccak256abiencodeseed_ i maxtokens i randomidsi randomidsj randomidsj randomidsi return randomids_tokenidtostringmy question is aside from the first require statement how would this need to be adjusted if one wanted the first tokenid to be 1 and the last tokenid to be the value of totalsupply eg first token 1 and last token 100 with a totalsupply of 100
368132,i tried to do it like this but it then reverts when using the highest idfunction metadataofuint256 _tokenid public view returns string memory require_tokenid 0 _tokenid totalsupply invalid_token_id uint256 seed_ vrfresult if seed_ 0 return uint256 memory randomids new uint256supplylimit for uint256 i 0 i supplylimit i randomidsi supplylimit i for uint256 i 0 i supplylimit 1 i uint256 j i uint256keccak256abiencodeseed_ i supplylimit i randomidsi randomidsj randomidsj randomidsi return randomids_tokenidtostring
368134,would it perhaps be enough for me to just change the last line to return randomids_tokenid 1tostring
368135,sorry for the spam think this might have resolved it along with the other adjustments i showed
368136,i cant remember who brought this up earlier but apparently they had concentrated liquidity before uniswap
368139,yearn and curve come to mind
368140,badger uses as well
368141,are there any privacy l2 options in the market
368142,aztec
368147,fi accidentally asked a client to send me money to the usdt contract he sent over 10k is there anyway for me to get this money back or is it lost forever
368149,i guess they could reissue the original account those tokens but will they do that
368150,how do you do that
368151,lol this sort of stuff always makes me wonder why wallets dont give any warning for this
368152,unironically contact tether support
368154,was using my ledger they make you unlock to get your address super annoying instead i just went back to a previous tx and copied the address from there
368155,but the address i copied was the smart contract
368156,use an ens next time
368157,oh damn if it was usdt id have a chanceits even worse i asked for usdc to be sent to the usdt smart contract f
368158,ya i stopped using ens after one i owned years ago expired now i get why i should def have one
368159,thats unfortunate
368160,oh crap they should still have some withdrawal function in the contract i believe
368161,usdc to usdc would have been salvagable too f
368162,wait cant you prove to usdc that you lost funds this way and they give you the underlying usd
368163,i mean this sort of stuff about be possible
368164,since its not recoverable
368167,contact usdt support theyll likely return in less than a week
368168,usdc to usdc theyll refund youusdt to a random contract they refund you 10 feeusdc to a random contract they wont refund youi accidentally got sent usdc to the tether erc20 contract
368170,dai
368171,hmmm usdt contract has a rescue feature
368172,
368173,thats the usdc contract dont think the usdt contract has this
368174,ahh getting confused
368178,how does this even happen the usdt contract is blacklisted
368179,i just checked and see this
368180,
368181,ah i see thats the issue usdc didnt block usdts contract address
368182,the blacklisting is for blacklisting sending wallet addresses not token addresses i think youll find
368183,if you used dai in the first place you wouldnt be so dumb
368184,575k of dai in the contract address
368185,uncessary violence dude
368186,right it doesnt help but they could blacklist to make certain the funds cant be removed from the sc and then make it quicker for them to refund
368187,although might get annoying for them if they unblacklist and a contract has a way to upgrade and then withdraw i wish they had the usdt recovery process or usdt had a recovery method on their token
368189,im afraid the reality is that there wont be a refund ever and you need to chalk it up as a loss when using a new payment route particularly with an unknown counterparty of unknown competence always sensible to do a small test tx first to check everything works as expected
368192,ya its my fault as well but so much back and forth for this client to get the money in i had sent the correct the address before in any case i guess i learnt first time losing money like this in crypto fucking annoying though
368193,i sent circle a support email i dont expect anything to happen though maybe in a few years theyll change their policy and i can recover the funds
368195,why circle i thought you said it was usdt
368196,did the client use a ui eg mm always wondered what the most common issue was
368197,its the other way around client sent usdc to tether contract
368199,i guess youre gonna need to do some unpaid work then
368200,we hired out a dev for this work we actually made 0 profit even had the money come in now im just down fucking annoying ill get over it but still
368201,anyone here ever create a wiki before i plan on creating one to advertise and teach people about main stream data some niche thing
368202,but i was just wondering do you guys knowuse mediawiki or any other personal suggestions
368203,ok then risk yourself being blacklisted for no reason
368204,those who leverage just end up with full bags of the other side not sure i understood you correctly
368208,you just end up with dai printing dai basically if it unwraps no i am feeling dumb today so could be wrong
368209,i asked the client to send usdc to the usdt smart contract i was confused what coin it was initially
368211,no ranges are fixed they only reinvest
368213,yes for both maker vaults arrakis resigned admin functions otherwise maker would not have approved those
368215,the vault isnt liquidatable due to the psm
368216,its overcollateralized
368219,if usdc depegs you have bigger issues than holding dai
368220,dai is already fully fully dependent on the regulation thats not new imho its now usdc with cool devs and governance slapped on top for now at least their collateral could be in danger and there are ways to go around it but the benefit of dai is that usdc cannot blacklist your dai address basically so collateral of dai is attackable but dai holders are not as they add rwa this becomes a true reality and not even a doomer speculation which is what i am kinda doing now ps still full admiration of all makerdao people genuinely
368222,except that dai has the psm with usdc
368223,no other stablecoin has this
368224,dai is already 60 usdc
368226,two most popular decentralized stablesoins are usdc wrapperswe deserve that
368228,theres an argument to be made that dai is a safer usdc cause its 40 backed by eth and only 60 backed by circles bank accounts
368232,as said its not liquidatable
368233,because of the psm
368234,this is an absolutely ridiculous claim
368235,read the makerdao docs before saying nonsense like this
368236,lmao it turns out that dragonfly are the mysterious whale who voted for the lido treasury diversification to sell tokens to themselves
368237,proof
368238,dragooonfly also were big terra investors
368239,
368240,while obvious in retrospect at the time the perception among us and the lido team was well you guys bought these tokens on the open market youre not so big as to dictate the entire vote so of course you get to vote with themtheyre governance tokens after all and owning tokens means you get to be a voice within the dao lesson learned skull_and_crossbones
368241,most of the teams would suggest to participate in votes if you put skin in the game on the open market
368242,we got criticized because we didnt vote on our own proposal at the end of the day its a matter of perspectives from the team making the proposal
368244,is there a service that gives me back a blocknumber for a specific daythere is the ethereumblockbydate lib but the calc is taking too longsure i could build my own cachebut is there a service that does this already
368245,anyone still inaround paris want to grab a drink steak or boulder dm me we can even make a small crypto dinner or something a roundtable on a topic
368246,thats the only one i know but afaik its an estimate
368247,countdown isnt what i wantbut good to point out to the etherscan api there i found what i want
368248,mr banned no longer but the docs do mention they had some sort of concentration beforein the first version kyberdmm allows people to add liquidity in a specific price range however this approach has a drawback liquidity providers have to add liquidity to predefined ranges in existing pools or create new pools with high gas cost uniswap v3 later showed how to concat these pools into 1 by defining the concept ofticks a tick is the price that is equal to the power of 10001but as stated it is still very much cut out from uniswap the variable names are a bit funny the docs are too obviously plagiarized from uniswaps the sentences read like someone was rearranging sections and deleting stuff hoping it wouldnt be too obvious
368249,kyber has been a complete joke for a while now they even deployed to bittorrent chain ffs
368250,if all of dais fiatcoins are deleted and relocated to the respective vaults of their issuers pending the result of a court case does dai still have utility
368251,nan
368252,lol
368253,too many things built by people who dont fear winter tbhnow that people learned to respect the dump i think a lot of these systems will be redesigned to be a lot more resilient
368254,like terra couldve maybe survived if it limited ust minting to 10 of what it was or less its not always that the system is destined to fail
368255,
368256,that doesnt make it a joke
368257,also often the incentives super important to companies
368258,yes dmm has nothing to do with this new version called elastic the first was just pools with amplification and then it has min and max prices this is a ticket based
368259,like opensea survived because of klaytyn grands which is why they have that super random integration even though it did nothing for klaytyn in the end
368261,recently ive developed an open source framework for creating a fair nft mystery box revealing process onchain the framework is extremely gas efficient 20000x than clone xs method i wrote an article about it i think its pretty cool and may have applications other than nfts and i would like to share it with fellow developers heretldr we create an innovative metadata shuffling framework fpe map for revealing nft mystery boxes in a fair and gasefficient manner fpe map requires storing only one random number onchain regardless of the size of the nft collection this makes it extremely gas efficient 20000x cheaper than clone xs method powered by the encryption algorithm any small change in the random number results in a drastically different mapping making rarity snipping impossible in combination with chainlink vrf v2 users are able to create a fair mystery box revealing process without setting up a custom backendarticle
368266,when you lose the plausible deniability can see the stablecoin wrapper being as notorious as tornado
368267,well said could say the same about many other stablecoin projs
368268,is there a tool that converts token total circulating supply into a graphic showing its increasedecrease
368269,you can create a ratio using mc and price with coingecko given the passage of time or check if someone created a dune dashboard for ur token
368271,what stops chainlink from by force or choice surreptitiously implementing a blacklist to neuter andor break certain dapps reliant on it
368272,good question
368274,with maker and chainlink its repetutational damage that is supposed to prevent bad stuff from happenjng rather than code or decentralization
368276,the new aave stable takes all of this to its logical conclusion wrap the centralized stuff usdc and rwa wrapper dai and usdc into a megastable increase resiliency hopefully
368277,nothing it was and still is fully trust based cl could pull the plug at any moment but we trust em to dont because it would be economically and reputation wise irrational
368278,but that doesnt work under force
368279,yeah no news tho
368280,and even under choice we have seen reputation counts for little if you have a good enough story
368281,people seem to be happy using em despite them having a killswitch to billions of tvl
368282,the prevailing narrative of chainlink is good enough means people arent really seeking alternatives and it is for better or worse good enough because the alternatives that do exist are just as bad real clunky to integrate or expensive which is a factor on ethereum
368284,doubt
368285,case in point dai vs liquity
368286,thats the issue you can seek alternatives but theyre not as easy to integrate or battle tested so nobody really bothers because hey its cl
368289,but that assumes it being bulletproof is the reason they would use it rather than a bunch of other intangible stuffguess its hope and pray if it is happening it happens soon enough so we get some real competition again
368290,one way would be to make the contracts immutable which then would require projects being able to switch to another one if you need to adjust the feed addremove nodes etc it would require dapps to think more about oracles andor implement ways to actively manage them that would remove the multisig thus the potential killswitch but its not smoothconvenient enough so nobody bothers why if you can simply read ethusd without caring what actually happens underneath
368291,one could also try building more defi primitives that dont require oracles like good old uni
368292,but many things require an oracle
368293,this is kinda an either or situation tho either dapps step up and actively put more work into oracles or they go the easy way and choose a managed service sorry for the shillwere currently working making both types available get an immutable data feed where you need to be able to switch to another one if you need to make adjustments to it one source acting up adding more sources etc get a managed service a la chainlink read ethusd without caring what happens underneath i think some people will go for the immutable stuff because they care enough but i believe the majority of this industry will simply gravitate towards whats easier to use
368295,you could use on chain oracles based on amms they get a bad rep because people a dont bother to implement flash loan guardrails and b often have much less liquidity than the honeypotbut none of these are like insurmountable issues
368296,thanks lets see i think its gonna be a while until people put more thought into oracles even tho its one of the most important parts of their setup
368298,maybe but the things we can actually build without feel somewhat more groundbreaking
368299,this assumes you want prices tho what about other data types
368300,what about stuff that doesnt necessarily trade onchain
368301,theres this great paper twap oracle attacks easier done than said you might find interesting
368302,well you need some external serversvalidators anyway at that point cl is about as good as any of them
368304,think there is a difference to be made about the people running the nodes and cl having a multisig that can rug everything of course the network in itself is very diverse and has some of the bigger names participating but that doesnt change the fact that the cl multisig can point the price aggregator somewhere completely else without any timelock or whatsoever
368305,its about as good as any of them as long as the multisig allows it
368307,get an immutable data feed where you need to be able to switch to another one if you need to make adjustments to it one source acting up adding more sources etcdoesnt that mean anything relying on it cannot be immutable
368308,welcome to the dilemmachoose where you want the immutability
368309,title is a bit catastrophistic considering most of the criticism is about the kind of average used for twaps hahai think its a fair paper though a bit of a truism the point of every attack to every blockchain is about expense vs reward the numbers they mentioned for manipulating a 2m pool dont fee that low to me
368310,i dont know if theres a dilemma there so much as a problem with the implementation you really need something like uniswap where everything can be automated with no human tweaking but with the ux of chainlink
368311,you can do it like liquity and build a closed loop that will never be changeable from their end using cl tellor as a fall back if anything ever happens theyre fuckedyou can have the immutability at the oracle level which means you need good ways to ensure your ability to change oracles wont get abused and is still designed in a way that you can act ashoc
368312,dont see that happening yet s
368313,well yeah we go back to the point about on chain prices if you want to use chainlink to send custom queries you can you dont care much about their aggregation tech then
368314,custom queries meaning
368315,you can send arbitrary http requests with their network
368316,yeah thats not really an aggregation tho youre simply using them for an api request
368317,yeah if i need control over aggregation i implement it myself if not im fine with cl handling the deets
368318,im far from a cl defender but its just a service people use
368319,so you aggregate yourself and pass that value onchain why should i trust that tho
368320,the oracle should give you some assurances that they all fetched a correct value
368321,beyond that you cant do much
368322,meh debatable d but yeah the tldr is what coiner wrote above
368323,idk just feels like theres a spectrum to this debate chainlink is leaning heavily on ux and it basically runs like a web2 company making it more decentralized loses flexibility and ux doubt that the tradeoff can be avoided
368324,stick the oracleizing in the network and provide a generalized interface for data retrieval
368325,before they did ocr to save gas im pretty sure cl did the aggregation onchainalso polkadot pretty much has this you can use its nodes to retrieve data and then do stuff with them onchain
368326,thanks can i create a dune dashboard or is it paid
368327,also the paper also focuses on uni v2 twaps which are a different animal from other forms including those on v3
368328,hmm interesting not sure why all the alt l1s dont do that by default seems like a pretty easy win to get rid of the chainlink middleman
368329,yeah i dont think anyones recommending to blindly use the the uni v2 twapalso fun fact the latest inverse hack was basically caused by them disregarding onchain prices and blindly trusting cl
368330,hm good question on polkadot i dont think theres been anyone who used them in serious capacity yet but the parachains are quite primitive also tbh half the stuff barely works at this stage
368331,also devs are lazy and dont want to implement their own oracles lol
368333,nvim all the way
368335,i forked aave on xdai code base is very complicated and there was no open source front end back then either
368337,hey its nice to see you around here just wanted to say ive been enjoying reading your discussions and have been learning a lot
368340,hey some one is using fake ivangi account to dm take care
368342,yup i got that too
368343,theres only one ivan and hes in stables
368344,i want to go to there
368345,but is his stable stable
368346,sorry had to say this
368347,yep this is way to nice and polite
368348,patriot lmfao he in dubai
368349,hey do you guys know any telegram grps where i can find people from different projects
368350,start searching in twitter some and usually they will include a tg link or use github to find and filter projects there you will be lead to their socials
368354,nan
368355,gotta help where needed
368357,
368358,hey guys i am trying to collect data of the companies that were hacked after the audit if anyone has that kind of data collected already could you please share
368359,maybe those will help there was a dashboard with a lot of hacks i cant find it
368360,thanks
368361,you can also check defiyield rekt database its very comprehensive and has an auditor filter
368363,perfect thanks a lot
368366,does a protocol list exist similar as token list but for protocols eg uniswap token address factory router
368367,usually the teams will publish addresses for their deployed contracts somewhere if not you could hit an approve look up the address through etherscan and trace back to the factory with read contract
368368,it would be more for an indexing use case
368369,eg search univ3 and show all the addresses
368370,similar to token list and along these lines uniswap token0x logouri v2 factory0x router0x
368371,i guess needs to be a collective effort with scraping seems a dead end was wondering if someone worked already in this direction
368372,ah well idk if someone was so kind to make that list and make it publicone alternative i could think of is scanning the defi llama source for all the connectors and pasting them
368373,might be an idea ill have a look at defi lama docs
368374,but i dont see why they should have a list of all smart contracts i guess they are more focus on specific ones eg factory pools
368375,well they must have the list of all the important pools somewhere to calculate tvl
368376,consider that each uni v2 deployment has thousands of mostly dead pools
368377,pancake has like 200k lol
368378,so its a lot of work i guess
368379,yeah i was less interested in the pools since you can get those from the factory address
368380,it was more for the static addresses
368381,but as token lists must be a collective effort not a scraping thing needs to be curated and publicy verifiable
368382,ivangbi where can i find the best strategy for delta neutral farming
368383,you could try playing around with a dune query to labelslabels
368384,interesting the labels are curated by dunecommunity
368385,yeah curated is a big term but the author is mentioned in the query so you can filter for authordune to get only the dune labels there are so many thats its impossible to be correct but if you want a list then this is the biggest one i know
368386,it also gives you all the the factories pools multisigs and whatnot so it requires some finer grained querying efforts which is not always possible
368388,
368389,does anyone have insights on when aave gho is likely to launch looks like theres a vote going on to approve it but im unsure if its an approval to start workin on it or if its all done and this vote is a launch now vote
368390,hi yws
368391,apisushirelaycomv1
368392,my guy
368393,
368394,you can apisecurerpccomv1 is the non sushi general private aggregation rpc endpoint
368395,just use us ser no fees no api key needed
368396,use securerpc api endpoint for this
368398,
368399,its prolly prolly teaching yourself how to code
368400,very little solid farming out there rn and if there is somewhat sophisticated to maintain
368401,golden times for cefi stablecoin issuers
368402,ive some strategies for delta neutral vault but what will be the keypoints to determine if its good or bad
368403,
368404,preparing for the rug pull
368405,just finished minting their og badges
368407,
368408,
368409,wait until you get to the suicidal cult part in this thread
368411,wtf wow is it sobylife
368413,or is that another soby account
368415,so the repo transaction volume for 1 day is the entire crypto mcap
368416,chain our glorified database has been turned off for nowis this appchainery the sort of theater thats supposed to fool the 3acs
368417,wew lads is in any form exaggerated its almost unbelievable
368418,facts
368419,reverse repo is bigger at 22tn
368420,anyway you can find raw data of repo deliveries and fails in the tradfi marketsurely on riskoff moves the repo fails shoot up
368421,good i was using this also to learn because i really never paid attention to any of the indicators before
368422,remco still has nothing to do with systemspace
368423,same guy
368424,hi there i curate a list of these on my compendium that may be helpful
368425,participated in the original token sale on juicebox rip yeah it was an unbelievable shitshow tbh kinda bummed to see that soby hasnt suffered any reputation loss from it
368426,influencoooooooooooors
368429,nice thread
368430,is anyone looking for a vault denominated in eth we launched stethvv a couple of weeks ago and last week it made 085 in eth no liquidation risk no incentive no magic
368431,bing bong strategic cross chain
368433,your name confused me for a sec
368434,this is something that can only be settled with fisticuffs
368435,lol
368436,til aglae french female name also investment arm of louis vuitton lvmh owner
368437,where are you guys farming atm stables and eth
368438,
368439,he gets more communist by the day
368440,he always was some kind of anarcho commie tbf
368441,congrats to moonbeam network for pushing you this far
368442,well his parents were from ussr
368443,yes and still not wrong imho
368444,yeah makes sense i think crypto in general tends to attract anarchists be they of the capitalist or communist type
368445,or maybe it turns people into anarchists lol
368446,i love how people virtue nonmoney driven values and all that nice stuff all that shazam after their pockets are already full and safu to live
368447,i am not against money driven values its one if not the only way we can actually align mechanisms right now just saying governance daos being ruled by tokens its still not in its final form imho still a lot of work to be done
368448,sushis governance being ruled by arca and or i think ftx has a bunch also etc etc there are some examples
368449,anyone know a team thats building a developerfirst dune with realtime data apis and alerts based on queries
368450,hi what should i look into to create something like etherdrops bot or nansen nft alert to get realtime event alerts on the blockchain run a node or use things like infura and websockets any help direction would be appreciated
368451,maybe its because once theyre safu they realise how miserable and blinded everyone else who arent safu they want to prevent other people getting locked into the spiral same way people dont demand democracy with an empty belly deal with survival then deal with ideal scenarios
368452,its openly not a dao anymore
368453,
368465,removed was a bunch of blabla yic_alex feel free to return the nonprovoking stormy part of your message
368466,just stop calling vitalik a communist everytime he proposes a solution thats not 100 based on raw capitalistic mechanisms
368467,sorry for adding more blabla bu its kinda started with your blabla calling vb communist
368468,yup fair noted
368469,all his campaigns about public goods funding have a purposeit touches on one of few things that raw capitalism just cant get right due to misplaced incentives public goods funding is done by governments today make it decentralized and suddenly you dont need governments as much thats why im saying hes an anarcho communist basically like orwell
368470,dont think hes like completely rejecting the premise of capitalism as a guy born in the ussr he knows too well why communism doesnt work
368472,oh yeah been there it didnt work at all all were equal all had nothing lol
368473,still more than anything that brang the capitalism after the fall __
368474,article on how to do stablecoin transfers without having eth
368475,btw in case you ever wondered whether vitalik is a tech guy
368476,they are overnight agreements
368477,us fed fdic accuse voyager digital of false and misleading insurance claims
368479,can you guys stop trading governance tokens
368480,gm lobster fam today i want to show you a rather atypical article and i want to warn you this kind of experience is new for me and i hope you like it
368486,i read it as a nod towards experimentations on hybrid governance like what optimism is doingclearly most daos as they are today arent working well enough
368487,is op rpc down
368488,is there any way to chart a curve pool
368490,chart what of curve pool
368491,llamaairforce has some charts
368492,regarding v and his commie comments im not sure if there is a better way to govern than through those with a vested interest having said that tapping into the wisdom of the crowds has considerable value imo distributing the ownership of the platform via a linear approach is easily beaten by a logarithmic method weve been working on something that should help to address this if there is any interest i will post it here when the docs go public
368493,there is no wisdom in crowds people at large are stupid and vitaliks comments werent commie
368495,if anything daos are commie experiments much like communes where decision making is hindered by debates between nitwits under the pretence of wisdom of the crowd especially awkward when this supposed wisdom is assumed to be correlated to wealth through weighted voting
368496,i feel attacced
368497,no offence comrade
368499,well teams got paid to take the time and bring activity to a new chain that is actually
368501,well they are incentives lol
368503,that doesnt matter from the op perspective imho was stuff deployed ye
368504,was stuff with reputation deployed and not just unknown forks ye
368505,fine was it maybe too costly thats another q
368506,actually afaik moonbeam gives or used to direct token grants to teams for building on it aligning incentives yadda yadda
368508,not my terminology lol
368511,apart from bitcoin and eth i dont know any ecosystem that hasnt done it to some extent
368513,people pay to get reputable stuff that already has users to port to them as new players
368514,that is absolutely fine whats the issue
368515,ah yes the good old days
368516,but theirs was more aligned to furthering research than grants to build on eth
368517,sounds like what ftx is trying to do with voyager
368518,people were going to be building on eth anyways
368520,
368522,hi sirshow is it possible so scam tokes got sent from binance hot walletbsc txid0x92fd60eea61a7ed146f02c6683b520450c8f186b9c41fcadae24f4e139a6117e
368523,thats an event log not the actual token transfer
368524,aaa so now got it thx
368526,
368527,is this project alive
368528,seems like it
368529,
368530,hey fozzysbo we have charts and run analytics on various pools with historical analysis of performance etc dm me if you want to access it bc still in beta rn
368531,same goes for anyone here
368532,i wonder what do degens think about regens regenerative finance
368533,
368534,in essence not that different not exactly always public goods so not as kumbaya as portrayed some ideas and solutions are cool most feels like targeting towards newer less sophisticated investors dont worry if price is going down this is like angel investing youre helping save the planet fren
368536,what are the latest frax collateralization metrics
368537,i think previous attempts can be summed up as we use crypto ponzis to save the planet haha
368538,i personally think the idea has legs fundamentally theres demand out there for them theres the problem in the opaqueness and lack of liquidity in the offchain market so amms can alleviate that problem the obstacle is educating the main demand drivers mostly corporates in using amms or creating a market of trusted middlemen to do it for them i think right now the main demand drivers are defi degens but that could change with time and with more service providers
368541,nice way to raise capital for carbon capture projects
368542,it also includes impact daos and any project that produces positive externalities
368543,i think there was a website shows farming vaults by aprs could someone share the link again plz
368544,defi lama
368545,coindix has a section as well
368546,
368547,thanks
368548,is there any uptodated one coz it doesnt have new platforms ike velodrome
368549,theres a few of these on my compendium this might be helpful for you
368550,thanks
368551,
368552,thanks
368553,nan
368554,nan
368555,is this a matrix
368556,lol
368557,
368559,does anyone know any resources where very early projects pitch themselves maybe something like a platform for introducing the project and the vc i hope i made myself clear if there are some please could you share with me guys
368560,
368561,
368562,vcs
368563,nan
368564,
368565,i guess sovsignal probably had something on this topic in his compilation as well
368566,nothing on my compendium around this topic other than a link to the resource you have about that aggregated all of the pitch decks you found
368568,thank you very much maybe there are also some communities in the project to vc interaction format i mean where young projects are looking for investments right now
368570,
368571,pod with xmons dropped
368572,sudoswap is pretty cool
368573,speaking of sudoswap were hosting the first nft financialization hackathon in a couple weeks with bounties from them nftfi nft bank decentral games ronin network ping me if youre interested in getting involved and any rtshares with your dev communities very welcome
368574,are you looking to chat with the vcs themselves or smaller investors
368575,theres definetely some discordtelegram groups out there that are paid to promote young projects which may have some vc backed funding but overall to find a genuine group that isnt paid promotion will be tricky probably just private groups
368577,hey guys friend of mine believes he found a bug with uniswap
368578,heres the link
368579,would appreciate if anyone smarter than me can check this out thanks
368580,havent read it in depth but regards fixing it uniswap contracts are immutable not an easy lift
368582,its a frontend bug
368583,bro accumulated 10 dollars worth
368584,to say that is a critical is a stretch by far
368585,only for eth pairsnot erc20if true
368587,104 doesnt it warn of insufficient liquidity
368588,that i assumed was exaggeration
368589,its true we are making a similar infra and this is a common pitfall
368590,blz 1m bounty ser
368591,its a bug yes on how they build the multicall transactions weird that they not add the refundeth tx but its not a bug in the solidity code or whatever is just a missusage of the architecture
368592,depends on the scope of the bug bounty it can get iin
368593,just bad ux tbh
368594,i think the way the uniswap router works is more nuanced than the post explains as they use a new auto router that sources liquidity from various destinations afaik most of it is off chain
368595,am i wrong did the response basically say that the user was warned that theyd lose those 11 eth
368597,this happened to me
368598,uniswap is giga stonewalling me
368599,i suppose their calculation is that gas savings from not including refundeth outweigh some of these edge cases losing money which tbh sounds like a reasonable assumption
368600,sure but theres no justification to refundeth being called to the immediate next swapper
368601,they were using expert mode and skipped the price impact warning aparently
368602,but it definitely feels like a bug on an emotional level haha
368603,nan
368604,nan
368605,she sent me a copy paste response
368606,no acknowledgement of refund eth spitting out my like its a slot machine
368607,twice
368608,i do believe in this case op had specified that it needs to be used for lm incentives and such and not just goes to team
368611,nan
368612,nan
368613,i mean kyber had a ton of time to fix this while not implementing core code id guess edit its a bait dont take it
368614,interesting airdrop swapdrophere a uniswap user on arbitrum tried to swap an exact amount 1385 eth the native asset for another token rdnt due to inadequate liqudity in the pool they were only able to swap 2537 eth a few transactions later another unrelated unsuspecting user performing an exact output swap for an entirely different asset receives the 113 eth intended for the initial user
368616,and another unrelated user inadvertently receiving the 117 eth a couple minutes laterlottery winner
368617,flagged with the team directly thanks to farm42 for letting me know
368619,lilmoonlambox3 from memezes to security researcher chad lol
368620,bro you feel me lmaoooo
368621,how else youd expect it to be carried out dev teams get 100s of larp bugs every day someone usually helps filter those be it immunefi or known community devs around the ecosystem
368622,they have been stonewalling me
368623,pretty hilarious
368626,samczsun pretty distasteful response i appreciate you reaching out
368629,broke believing czs uniswap security bugswoke believing lilmoonlambos uniswap security bugs
368634,this is not a place for your culture war there are no crypto natives and were all idiots doesnt matter if women or men
368636,oh i just meant like they didnt think that some random person getting the eth was a bug not that hard to get idk about others but im surely an idiot
368643,3m
368644,
368645,i am legit dumb so what happens to stuff collateralized stables and like protocols as the merge happens
368646,business as usual given everyone has been testing
368647,on the main network ethpos no changesif there will be a fork ethpow centrzlied issuers and cexes must support or ignore itdefi will also be dubled lolor u mean smth different
368648,yeah also this
368649,should one hedge or take any precaution actions w assets on ethpos like usdc and dai
368650,2nd option is a fkicng mess
368651,ive been trying to find the answer to this for months
368652,what is really preventing anyone from forking ethereum pow and miners choose to continue mining this ethpow
368653,is there a nontrivial chance that usdt chooses eth1 over eth2insert why not both gif
368654,
368655,only if they will burn some usdt on each chain to keep fiat collateral balanced
368656,ah that is going to be an interesting fork then
368657,the fiatcoins decide the fate of the chain theory is gonna have quite the large scale real world test sooner than expected
368658,what about the nfts lol wouldnt this make most nfts valueless
368659,very little chance the nft community will lobby for pow
368660,ser if this will hapen u ll douple your nftswill u shill your pow nfts to make extra profit
368661,i will most of communities will
368662,feels like bcashbtc but worsemore problematic
368663,an nft is meant to be 1 unique digital receipts representing the existence of some unique thing that lasts indefinitely onchainan eth pow fork would make 2 of them
368664,a lot more problematic bsc and bsv only had their native coin of concern eth has tokens
368665,nigh unlikely tether nukes half on each chain to balance things out and fiat doesnt grow on fork trees sooo start stocking up on
368666,if theres a eth pow hard fork thatll use a different chainid right so retail users will still using eth pos by default postmerge
368667,what would happen if somebody made a weth offer before merge can accept offer on eth pow after merge there is not zero chance that eth pow could cost more than 2nd copy of nft bayc moonbirds whatever
368668,dump the eth on eth1 as a free airdrop retail will mostly move to eth2 as wallet rpcs will point there and economic activity will die down on eth 1 so less incentive for tether to nuke their business trying to save pow
368669,how much do you have to pay everyone to choose pos many people love pow
368670,i feel like retail does not care
368671,doesnt matter right as long as wallets point to pos most retail will use it
368672,yeah but i feel the normal tokens arent that big of a deal because their value is largely intangible not so for fiatcoins they really do have to choose one or the other
368673,any usdtc fiatcoin whales with a pow fetish
368674,it is likely that most of the pow die hard stable coin users would be users of less centralized stables such as mim lusd frax dai sort of
368676,well all but one of those are fundamentally dependent on fiatcoins so it doesnt change much
368677,tfw your marketedasdecentralized stablecoin has its fiatcoin ingredients split across 2 chains fun prospect
368678,someone just mentioned pulsechain but it got removed from the chat i remember this same discussion regarding doubling the value of eth native assets was discussed with richard hearts pulsechain
368679,not sure anybody that matters is gonna make compromises in favor of ponzi chain so it doesnt matter much
368682,talking about that scam just gives it more reach theres nothing technically interesting about it
368683,they can pick one side then start reissuing some on the other later on theyre centralized and chain agnostic
368684,altho it doesnt make much sense
368685,people said the same about hex and then it x43749871297213d without me in it
368686,curious to see how it plays out
368687,we dont discuss price action here no one is contesting that scams can make money
368688,fair
368689,but the dapps on the other side need it from the start to not blow up cant really kick the can down the road that way
368690,they cant also just pretend the fork magically doubled the fiat in their bank accounts either so they need to choose
368691,yea one side is blowing up which is why im not sure u wanna salvage anything there
368692,theres gonna be lots of fun mev to learn from that
368693,good l1 coverage covering l1 dev activity cohort analysis
368697,vitalik will save us from forkapocalypse
368698,imho theres tremendous incentive for some smallish exchangesstablecoins to hype up eth pow
368699,is it technically feasible to fork eth literally the block before the merge though
368700,lol bancor saying that daos are requesting them to reopen deposits anyone knows a dao that did that
368701,ill just share this point without getting into any price talk from what i understand pulsechain will do a state copy of eth hence all your tokens on eth will be duplicated on pulse obviously its a meme to think itll have any intrinsic value on there but some hexicans think it will
368702,is pulsechain pos or pow and have they begin their copyif pulsechain turns out to be pow and havent forked eth yet the merge could be a potential marketing opportunity for them
368704,pulsechain is proof of richard heart
368705,lol
368706,proof of prada
368707,
368708,thanks for this
368709,what do you guys think about blockchain projects that go the nonvc route for example crowdfunding by selling sbts is there any project that successfully bootstrapped like that
368710,curve
368711,oh wow i didnt know that thanks
368712,
368713,pos lol
368714,wait uh i meant curve the dex
368715,but it turns out smth else too
368717,if these guys ever try to branch out into crypto theyre going to have a terribly confusing time
368718,boson raised 80m through dutch auctions but they also previously raised from vcs if i recall well
368720,just checking its this one right
368722,
368723,thanks yeah i guess its easier to do that when you get an initial investment
368724,can anyone give input positive or negative on audit firm slowmist ideally if you directly worked with them
368727,make this statement in here two years ago ban
368728,sorry i misread the comment
368729,gm guys anyone knows how i can build a bot that relays messages from telegram to discord channel
368730,hm3359 i saw this implemented in your server any idea
368731,see at least we used it when lobster dao had a second dao chat bridged with a discord server
368732,ive used this before
368733,rmrk sold nfts to raise
368734,how can we add to this
368735,there is no moving to eth2 pos eth is eth
368736,i really thought we were done with these bullshit index tokens
368737,rocket pool was in existence in testnet mode when lido just announced their arrival but both are worlds apart in terms of adoption what did lido do which rocketpool missed doing has it got to do with decentralisation from day 1 that led rocketpool lagging miles behind thoughts pls
368738,lido did marketing and bizdev while rocketpool didnt
368739,could be but does whales and institutions who have staked so much eth on lido fell only for marketing gimmicks
368740,the bizdev part is networking the right early supporters
368741,big part of the game
368742,best product doesnt always win on its own
368743,agree with your biz dev part on product front does rocketpool has more friction than lido
368744,how can we spot good biz dev of a project in its early days
368745,is there a way to do onchain voting without paying gas might be a dumb question
368746,i wonder if they are available every major protocol forum has email login but voting onchain and no login option into the forum with web wallets dont know why it is so
368750,you can sign to delegate to someone else who then submits it onchain for you
368751,sign to delegate gaslessso we cant see the delegation until the onchain tx is made
368752,but otherwise if ur not paying gas i dont see how the blockchain is supposed to know abt it
368753,the snapshotx product kinda its basically very very cheap if thats the question
368754,yeah thats what i thought just wanted to make sure
368755,wow interesting thanks for sharing
368756,nathan_vdh is your man if you have questions
368757,anyone farm on optimism whats the best strategy for stablecoin
368758,velodrome is pretty nice
368759,sbts are nonexistent concept its just a collection of words people decided to hype up simply lets tie your money and identity and reputation to this one wallet ok done thats nothing
368760,reputation thing could be good for advertising certain stuff to special audiences for example in gamefi and sbts are to help collecting that data
368761,no but i dont want to get into the old debate of your wallet is not your identity muh privacy and so on boring
368762,you dont need sbts then cause you can just look at the onchain activity and history of a wallet sbts are fugazi
368763,negative
368764,sbt2 are
368765,not if the sbt is issued by a dapp to assign some kind of reward achievement based on its internal model however i agree that the concept is kinda broken by design because you cant transfer them in case of a compromised wallet or similar situations dont really get the usecases seems forced so far
368766,its just a badge a poap
368767,muh give fancy names
368769,why is it wrong if reputation is attached to a wallet address
368770,negative docsrmrkappnontransferablealso possible to move them via turnout biased vote by other holders
368771,if its possible to move them in any way theyre not really soulbound
368772,instead of attaching your whole onchain reputation to one wallet it should be across multiple wallet we dont do all onchain activities to one wallet and comprise of that one wallet will be zero sum game
368773,yeah non transferable is the key when it has to be called sbt else it defeats the purpose
368774,should probably move this to nft_avenue
368775,movable by consensus of all other immovables for the sake of recovery
368776,sbts are not restricted to nfts
368777,what are they restricted to
368778,ok
368779,nah is okay here imho continue
368780,i meant not looking sbts as nfts rather on chain pops across sectors
368781,chain pops
368782,poaps
368783,untransferable poaps
368784,yep
368785,they seem to make little sense for other token types
368786,you havent said yet what is so special about sbts apart from being bloody untransferable poaps yet so many hype it up like some magical concept is not is bloody not muh fugazi naming
368787,like kids get stars for their work in kindergarden
368789,perfect character progression system is use case 1
368790,i feel they make sense for defi for small flash loans bases on your past credit history
368791,perfect reputational avatar systems with supercharged creator economy are use case 2
368792,thats both fugazi
368793,this makes no sense blz rephrase
368794,flash loan for reputation
368795,thats fugazi af
368797,just low duration loans he meant i think undercollateralized low duration loans
368798,perfect supercharged creator economylike can you point out what the advantages are on a technical level
368799,yeah kind of
368800,i would wanna sell my character at some point and oulala if we make these character things movable we just get upgradeable nfts so where is sbt
368801,yeah if everything is soulbound youre not gonna have any economy is this meant like in an rpg style where some items cant be transferredbut if so wouldnt be the natural way to implement this just be like transferable items with a lock on the transfer functionit seems like such a small change to create a whole branding about
368802,soulbound has a pseudo magical high tech aesthetic for such a basic concept
368803,anyone know some good blogs about blockchain gaming theses
368804,tbh i feel like sbt fans are just pushing new shiny crap down my throat you dont have to have a fancy name unless you literally say yes we like fancy term which is totally fine you can just say untransferable nfts or like poaps but you cannot move them thats it thats the tweet there is no tech in sbt either
368805,omfg how many times can i share my docs and talks before you stop dismissing this without giving it a second of thought
368806,so frustrating
368807,good overview
368808,i read your docs i just legitimately dont see whats the big deal about it
368809,sure you can implement something like that but why the branding making nfts non transferable isnt some groundbreaking technical or conceptual leap imho
368810,which you mean literally the sbt name
368811,ive come up with a bunch of blockchain gaming theses curious to see whats out there thinking the real use case of web3 in gaming is for aligning incentives between playersspectatorsdevsinvestorsstreamerspros roblox or warcraftlike platforms for user generated content skirting regulation for betting bootstrapping users against cold start problem with token emissions interoperability with defi protocols making gaming assets productive might just be a meme i tihnk all the axiestepnweb3 runescape stuff is not great
368812,if anyone thinks about this stuff please dm me would love to talk 1 year into creating a stealth web3 moba about to launch beta and want to meet interested people
368813,some people act like sbts will be for nfts what nfts have been for fungible tokens its far from theyre literally just nfts you cant move
368814,ty
368815,yes true we use the sbt name because vitalik made it popular even though we have had sbt2 in prod for 7 months longer than his post but we just cant reach people even with 100k dropped on marketing unless we piggyback on trends weve found
368816,this is totally fine btw everyone likes shiny new terms my only problem is with larpers who now try to fundraise and shill sbt tech as something new is not is as you also said untransferable nfts which have been live for months
368817,its not that without sbts it was not possible before scenario they have been around for ages and were used a magical shiny term doesnt make a shit game better or bad incentives better only for the scamraise maybe
368818,degenscore was good example
368819,i think the name is lame but id support anyone trying to leverage a name that goes well with users signal boosters andor investors
368820,yep 100 agree if implemented as originally discussed just bound to wallet but when done with proper nesting it becomes something else it actually becomes closer to actual soulbound from wow if implemented our way than the vitalik just block transfer way is all i mean
368821,thanks good to know
368822,actually nice examples in docs too
368823,thanks that was helpful
368824,swader would these non transferable nfts be able to moved onto the bitcountry parachain via xcm if so that opens some very useful properties in that metaverse
368825,sure again this is not new tech you can just port to another chain for that you need a bit more complex contracts architecture but its trivial
368826,sure you can port but surely omni chain or whatever the cool kids are calling it nfts are the killer featuresay i have an nft in kusama and it represents my reputation am i a dick or cool on kusama then i transfer that across to ethereum and some of that reputation comes over obvious example might be a credit score nft that then allows you a lower collaterized rate on aave
368827,nfts dont make sense as wrapped assets like an erc20
368828,so id imagine atomic transfer for nfts is a pretty killer feature
368829,yes easy bridgeless transfer is also a huge selling point of all this because now you have not only a super pimped out reputational avatar that looks good but also a one stop shop from which a defi chain or app can read your info reliably and quickly enough to give you something like an undercollat loan
368830,docs look great ser will explore more soon
368831,theres a project on kusama giving people trophies for every on chain referendum vote and people can equip them onto a shelf a project can then just read the cool looking shelf and give you perks
368832,has anyone had a think about what happens nfts if we do get a pow eth forki can understand that defi stables oracles etc etc for the most part stick with the pos chain and dont function but nfts are a different storythe really need a liquidity pool or much of anything to exist on both and im sure there will be argument made about provenance etcanyways just curious about thoughts
368833,let me know if you have a question after you do
368834,will dm you for sure looks like youre building some great stuff
368835,i guess it would be up to the minter to declare the canonical version
368836,same as with centralized stables for defi whatever most protocols tap into like if opensea looksrare gem genie sudo go away then those are the real ones with defi you can get more purists like etc people back in the days but most nft people are retail with no understanding behind what they do they just click on interfaces
368837,the v1 vs v2 cryptopunks stuff gives an insight into the arguments that will be made in saying that nfts on both chains will be priced in their native eth so pow nfts will be worth lessalthough i can see them going to the extent of wrapping im using this word v loosely and bridging them over to the pos chain and making claims of provenance its a head scratcher which i can see defo being a debate opportunity at the v least
368838,ez to convince nft ppl to do pos because of the energy narrative
368839,i would disagree with this the stable issuer can say which coin is collateralised and which cant be done to the same extent here they can say which chain they support for the project but its completely different imo
368840,i kinda said that tho issuers decide
368841,the issuer of the nft
368842,is that still a narrative thats being pushed thought it fizzled out havent heard about it for a while
368843,it did as retailnormies got washed out they were the one pushing it
368844,i think its too early to give a specific definition of what is precisely a soulbound concept but it somehow should be related to digital reputation as the primary use casewe have partnered with degenscore to make continuouslyupdating nfts reflecting onchain achievements you can find more sbtslike projects in our blogunfortunately we are not following kusamas ecosystem closely and forgot to mention projects from there
368845,hmm i thought a very first soulbond nft was just a private key
368846,well were evm now too
368847,its also the ppl who wants the retailnormies to come back and new ones to join who cant wait for pos especially if you work with artists its something they focus quite a bit on
368848,
368849,were at that point of the l1 rotation game that its just a parody of itself lol
368850,must be troll marketing scheme
368851,any list of meetups in sf or nyc
368852,i agree with you here my first take on it was you just set a token nft or not as nontransferrable i didnt think that required a whitepaper
368853,however thinking about it more i came up with an interesting idea it basically allows you to permanently mark a wallet address
368854,we are building a stablechain and were trying to minimize state growth to maintain decentralization and to do that we want to limit the number of accounts in the state the idea is to have 2 kinds of accounts persistent and non persistent persistent accounts work just like normal accounts while non persistent accounts can receive normally but as soon as they send they have to zero out the account and it gets destroyed the sbts which will be limited will be the pass for persistent accounts
368855,what do you guys think good idea or nah
368856,it makes no sense to me
368857,a new chain that can only do x for no reason basically abandoning everything a 247 mechanism makes possible
368858,thanks bruno googling it now
368859,documented here docsrmrkapp on the origin page
368860,excellent thanks
368861,my man
368862,i got the idea after reading this article from stopanddecrypt
368863,
368864,even moreso lido is able to take large institutional deposits
368865,got me thinking what if there was a regulated version of ethereum that tries to limit state growth
368866,rocketpool is not because you can not stake in excess of supply and supply is constrained by current amount of node operators as operators have to stake their token
368867,bizdev really means more steth usage
368868,there will still be 247 usage but the growth of those types of users will be controlled hope that makes sense
368869,no
368870,first get users then worry about nonexistent problems you dont have
368871,getting users is the real problem why solve for problem you dont have
368872,controlling growth seems weird
368873,dont make new chains
368874,is usually the best answer
368875,
368888,hey samthis is their responsesteph bell uniswap labsjul 29 2022 1345 edthi jeremymy name is steph i lead the customer experience team here at uniswap labs ive had sara escalate this ticket to me to further clarify the details surrounding the swap you wrote in aboutfirst i want to acknowledge that your swap had an undesired outcome and i know from personal experience that this can feel incredibly frustrating we handle requests to investigate these types of transactions by coordinating with internal experts to ensure a full understanding of what occurredi also want to confirm the engineering team has visibility into this support ticket we take these matters very seriously which is why the engineering team has been updated on every correspondence youve made in our email thread multiple folks on our team have investigated your transaction thoroughlyin the example of your specific scenario you did receive the number of tokens that was quoted to you in the interface as per the uniswap labs terms of service you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool and especially in expert modes experience significant price slippage and cost the price impact risk and warning displays in our interface are there to proactively inform and obtain consent from users about the decisions theyre making with the uniswap protocolfinally to clarify your question about how the router works the next exactout got the refundeth added and received the eth refundeth is never added to exactini hope this helps to explain your request in more detail please let me know if you have additional questions here im more than happy to elaboratesincerelysteph
368896,kinda mixing up days ill keep mum
368899,ne happens to everyone else same message as before nothing new just the one of yesterday got purged by mistake no news yet for now
368900,completely agree with this users give the network its value just trying to learn from mistakes made by chains before us and we really value decentralization state size is not something that can be fixed when the problem becomes apparent
368901,yeah agree with this as well i just dont see a chain out there that solves what we are trying to do
368902,i want sell macbook at which i created seed if i delete everything in disk utility and reinstall macos is it safe enough or shouldnt sell just destroy
368903,pretty sure youre fine but rather than destroying your macbook wouldnt it be better for you to just move your assets to a brand new wallet from a new seed
368904,microwave the shit out of it or change wallets
368905,there are applications which write zeros to all of the memory to erase all of content just deleting files usually doesnt actually delete them it just changes a small part of memory which tells the os theres a file there this isnt 100 fool proof because some regions of memory get worn out over time and dont get written to and basically preserve what was thereafter selling your machine you might as well treat the private key as compromised so moving all your assets to a new address would likely be best
368906,on macos there is filevaultencryption also turned on does it still can be compromised after i delete vol and recreate itim very paranoid in general just want get closer to reality
368907,and in this group does some one really have not turned on encryption on anything i dont think so they are all in nft kingdom
368908,most of the time the seed is already encrypted applicationlevel filevault adds another layer just delete the volume then all good
368909,ayo kek
368910,if u delete in disk utility from startup screen and do a fresh install not a reinstall theres a difference then you should be safe
368911,personally instead of selling that mac id just keep it as an offline crypto module and buy a new one for personal
368912,not sure though if your disk is encrypted youre in a slightly better position just for your paranoia it would definitely make sense to store your assets on a hardware wallet direct from the manufacturer because your seed phrase will never leave that device then for any transactions you create a hot wallet and transfer a subset of your tokens that you accept bad shit can happen to
368913,underrated
368914,but yeah regarding file vault every time u do a fresh install macos creates a new set of keys rendering old set useless anyways
368915,ikr
368916,no email no tg no dodgy sites just moon
368922,you have a place you discuss your game like other group or something
368924,
368926,ooooh baby
368927,just use sushiswap
368929,overwrite the data first then delete
368932,optioncommandpr reset nvram or pram if your mac is using a firmware password it ignores this key combination or starts up from macos recoveryin case your mac has this hardware too
368933,how do you determine which protocol a contract belongs to
368934,normally id just look at the contract deployer and trace through from there
368935,lots of references to dxswap dx dao and swprconverter on the owner of the one you linked
368936,thanks having trouble with this one im thinking swapr
368937,ok that helps thank you
368938,swapr makes sense when you look at the erc20 transactions tab of the owner
368939,i would check the contact code first then the deployercontract name dxswaprouter
368940,yes swapreth made by dxdao was originally called dxswapeth
368943,is etherscan down or just my internet
368944,down for me
368945,yep down
368946,good just wanted to make sure it wasnt my shitty internet
368948,also try otterscan pretty awesome
368949,hey guys can anybody point me to some solid reading material on how stables will work w the merge
368950,hey all thought i would share a report we just wrote on the merge and its impact on capital flows mev miners forks and more
368951,nothing about how stables fundamentally operate will change postmerge along with every other contract currently in use how this affects the overall stablecoin market in terms of positive market outlook is a different question and up for debate
368954,anyone knows of a way to export all wallets created with a particular seed in metamask eg to json
368955,is there any way to create new wallets without reinstalling metamask
368956,or buying new computer
368957,bip39 tool but make sure to save the page and run it offline better
368958,not sure i understand
368959,on the current wallet you can generate now addresses but they all use the same seedphrase
368960,how do i generate a new wallet
368961,you mean metamask wallet
368962,just import a new private key then but if you want new generation you need to change the base seed phrase metamask uses so yes reinstall
368963,damn
368964,using different browser should work too
368965,create a new profile in your browser and open metamask on that profile
368967,yep this tbh
368968,oh nice hack
368969,i was talking abt brave vs chrome
368970,but didnt think of new profile same browser
368971,the one at iancolemandotiobip39
368972,good nickname
368973,yup
368974,mke sure its not an ad page
368975,i once almost got rekt by it
368976,would have lost my lobs for real kek
368977,cheers will take a look
368978,need automated multiwallet crosschain portfolio tracker
368979,quite an ivan move
368980,i wonder how stables will work after the fork of pow you cant possibly just double the amount of value you were holding if your ethereum assets get duplicated on both the pos merge and the pow forkmy guess is that the stables in the fork will probably lose their valuethere also an interrogation mark regarding how oracles will work in the forked net
368981,nothing will work unless everything stays in pow binary outcome
368982,ivangbi does this group ever host voice calls or no
368983,lobsters can not speak
368986,
368987,how are u playing around the merge
368988,
368989,who is going to continue eth pow
368990,you guys all know who lol
368991,im not that educated
368992,chinese miners
368993,what about the chinese ethereum aka neo
368994,a lot of people here in slovenia are mining for free with extra power from their solar roof systemsedit so people with equipment will surely mine something
368995,i think you mean factom
369000,export logs
369001,how do they get electricity at night
369002,so the system is designed in a way where you can take out as much as you put in and overall you make more per day than you use at night
369003,hey ser may i ask you for this one as well
369004,yeah pretty much the way it will work is the stablecoin issuer will decide which chain they will honor redemptions for
369005,only stablecoins that could work on both chains simultaneously would be 100 eth backed stablecoins imo and of course would need functioning oracle
369006,is lusd 100 eth backed i think they are last i checked
369007,yes they are
369008,was under impression its 110 with ethbut stand to be corrected
369009,sorry not what i meant haha didnt mean collateral ratio i just meant type of collateral
369011,definitely overcollateralized
369012,so with only eth collateral and a functioning oracle on pow fork lusd could still have value there
369013,aaah got that dit seemed to me so
369014,nice nice good find
369015,hmm wonder if its worth holding lusd or other similar stables going into the merge in hopes of a fork
369016,no oracle will support pow fork i bet
369017,the only question is if pow eth would be valued at 23 of pos eth how much would lusd be worth in pow network 23 cents
369018,yeah true unless it started off at similar pricing and gave time for lusd redemptions collateral value backing would get smoker
369019,even so could get something out of it for nothing
369020,when i said nothing will change i mean like the underlying mechanism for how they achieve stability will be altered as well as the contracts themselves how the macro outlooks on the merge as well as the possibility of a pow fork affect it im not sure and is up for debate i do agree tho yes its quite likely that assets on the pow fork chain will become worthless esp since exchanges arent willing or prepped to accept those assets
369021,there is an option to military grade erase a drive content in utility disk
369022,my friend just faced that almost successful attack have anyone experienced that
369023,this is a case of attack where new malicious metamasklike browser tab is asking you to check and insert your recovery phrasedo double and tripple checks before any action
369024,this attack is very old people usually experience it when trying to google dapps and clicking a phishing link
369025,it was a captcha bot for nft discord btw
369026,anyway i think the giga caution to avoid such attacks is keeping in mind that metamask shouldnt ask for your seed phrase more than one timebasically you should only use your seed phrase just one time on new devices
369029,idk if its okay but can i ask like product questionnaires here
369031,late to this discussion but this is why every artpfp nft should be sold under an express license and that license should have express fork handling rules did it this way with the rarible nft license
369034,hi guys i want to perform analysis on nft marketplaces so im trying to build a nft dashboard with different stats on them but im struggling to find one solid source of data transactions mints where i can tell on which platform action was takenim kind of new to nfts so any advice would be helpful
369035,hi sure
369036,one solid source of data is literally blockchain itself i think
369037,but is there information about marketplace transaction was made with
369038,is there any way to add multiple wallets into bundles of zapper or debank or zerion i want to track 100 wallets would i have to add each manually
369039,thats a lot of wallets
369040,you can first try to detect the wallet addresses that pertain to certain marketplaces gradually adding them to your analytical tool that is the hardest and most obvious way i can see here but bockchain actually stores all this data it is just not unified under one interface with filters
369044,dune analytics
369045,there you can set up your query to track anything
369048,dune is very good overallalso i know dune is a community project free but do they have any source of income or sponsorship etc
369049,kek
369056,kek2
369058,they have pro subscriptions
369059,claystack has ido coming soon
369060,did they have a deck that time
369061,with debank yes you have to add manually
369062,anyone here used the new arbitrum bridge yet cant see the claim button anymore to bridge back to l1
369063,did anyone try to cross check numbers from this tweet with cryptofeesinfo is this even possible like if you look at optimism it did 170k tx yesterday per and there was 13k paid in tx fees per cryptofeesinfo the tweet says optimism charges 280000 gas for batching and 3300 per tx can we use those numbers and see if we get close to 13k shown on the website or this approach is too simplified im asking because im getting numbers nowhere near to what is reported
369064,seems perhaps a bit biased at least they didnt record unique addresses for near also of note is that rainbow bridge is 4th largest amongst blockchain bridges
369065,anyone know where dune gets its data from like who labels it
369066,dune wizards
369067,token soontokenize everything blz and airdrop to community
369068,anyone knows if eth merge block height is confirmed yet
369069,i understood that it is not set on block height but difficulity and it is only defined for goerli not mainnet
369070,that growth metric seems biased and i am unsure if that is driven by incentives or measured at that phase from messaris recent evm reportniche ecosystems moonbeam and near protocol serve a small subset of users and are yet to find productmarket fit they have less than 10000 daily active wallets and less than 100000 daily transactionsnears aurora stands out for the sharpest drop in new wallets suggesting its historical growth was inorganic and driven by incentivesthe recent average of active addresses on ethereum is 60 of its alltime high showing high stickiness on the other hand nears aurora has retained only 1 active addresses of its alltime high
369071,do not use link
369072,driven by incentives or bots
369073,this isnt reliable unless you can trace the deployer to a known wallet many scam forks use the same names as known contracts
369074,mms bridged billions usd and people think it is new paradise
369075,true always have to verify things
369076,no its not for mainnet check wenmergeorg
369077,
369080,this has been asked multiple times
369081,the biggest risk is dapps using this for tokenlists
369082,thanks for sharing i hadnt seen this report agreed the tweetthread likely cherry picked a low to report the increase since then i had chosen to discard that data point my issue with the original article was more that the metrics presented for each chain were cherrypicked didnt follow a template egpolygon cumulative count of new addresses that create contracts new address count wallets with nfts active user count with comparision to solana and bnb chainsolana daily unique fee payers daily unique programs used nakamoto coefficientnear daily active addresses daily txs drawdown in tvl compared to ath number of github commits weekly active developers
369083,wtf
369084,does anyone know of a way to get transaction history on serum quite insane that this is the backbone of solana and i cannot easily see my trades
369085,
369086,iirc layer zero also had a paper on the delta protocol i cant seem to find this and would appreciate any pointers
369087,its stargates whitepaper incase any one else is looking
369088,nan
369089,hes not wrong though i looked into them a while back dead space nobody has figured out the right niche with callsputs yet in this space and just building the tech doesnt make money without a good niche to target
369090,lacking of liquidity on chain
369091,whats the meaning of this samuel are u trying to hack us
369092,we had it implemented and fully working it is paused at the moment i have no specific idea on how it works as im a nondev in the team x_x it was implemented before i joined sorry i couldnt help more
369093,not sure are you spamming the chanel
369094,
369095,samczsun hey man did uniswap ever get back to you about the bug
369096,or in their words a feature
369097,i think there should be at least a pr out
369098,binary options are pretty popular for retail
369099,thats nice thank you theyve ran the hard line about how there is no bug and have refused to send me my funds back
369100,anyone here from aave ethereum ui seems do be down
369101,imho its always the symptom not the problem itselfi think for perps theres an issue that amm models are borked and order book dexs are clunky and sometimes not even that decentralized on solana its even worse because why would you ever use one over the ftx account that 99999 you already havewhile for options collateral requirements mean that mms have to put up waay too much capital plus options are hella volatile but the blockchain is laggy so no one does it in size
369102,use furucombo
369103,and order book dexs are clunky and sometimes not even that decentralizedis there any decentralized orderbook dex
369104,sec charges forsage founders promoters in 300 million crypto ponzi scheme lawsuit
369105,rly
369106,not exactly decentralized but iirc deversifi was using tee so anyone could replicate an ob
369107,very much centralized yes
369108,supposedly the starkex exchanges deversifi dydx are non custodial so still somewhat decentralized
369109,id say uniswap v3 if you count ranged uni v3 lps as a limit orders
369110,multicall issues are documented
369111,uniswap is aware of potential issues wrt multicall usage tho this isnt related to your referenced issue worth mentioning
369112,those are very much centralized thats why and how they can ban you from trading on the network level because bad ip they are onchain though
369113,they claimed theyd move everything onchain by eoy then came the cosmos pivot
369114,they can always blacklist your address on the frontend
369115,yeah the claim did always sound weird
369116,thank you samuel
369117,not a frontend thing
369118,i am not samuel but thanks
369119,i am saying they could if they wanted to
369120,its a great name take the compliment kek
369121,
369122,this guy gets it
369123,sam isnt even my real name kek
369124,certainly but dydxs banning goes beyond a compromised ui
369125,but is banning worse than whitelisting
369126,i believe rfq could solve it
369127,the problem is that some entity can do either
369128,this guy gets it somewhat
369129,the problem is liquidation engines not liquidity
369130,such markets are limited by littles law
369131,well it is now
369132,is there any tradfi mass market where rfq dominates
369133,currency markets are a type of rfq
369138,you launched edi no
369140,whats the largest problem for you when you are trading on decentralized exchanges
369141,liquidity so price related stuff
369142,and fees
369143,lp fees or transaction fees
369144,transaction
369145,uniswap trade on mainnet is like 2 bucks now
369146,fees more so for perp dex products
369147,non basic amm swaps
369148,any sites to see upcoming unlock of any tokens
369149,
369150,if you want any coins to be added you can send a request
369151,in this piece of code from line 133 142 what does that mean i dont understand that part
369152,it stops people from selling for 10 seconds when the cool down is enabled it also only allows certain accounts to trade when trading is enabled you might also want to check what allowedtransfer does
369153,oh can i dm you for more on this
369154,sure
369157,how many protocols have deployed their frontend in ipfs could it be like 20 of protocols approximately what are the most common downsides and challenges of such decision
369158,it takes forever to get the information from the ipfs
369159,everything is slow as fuck
369160,creating a middleware to cache data to speed up the loading defeats the purpose
369161,wen ipfs l2
369162,
369163,unintentional centralization because your domain ends up having to be pointed to cloudflare or something to render it in browsers that arent brave
369164,my guy ipfs is not worth the pain it adds latency unambiguously by definition you are adding additionl hops for dns at the min
369165,your already using a centralized dns resolver like 8888 or 1111 etc
369166,that was my point
369167,i know i am agreeing with you
369169,not verified yet also most likely not a rug but rather a hackaccidentally replied to julians message please ignore that
369170,what are bbo like stream products for crypto usd markets currently out there
369171,we are investigating
369172,did not mean to reply to your message earlier godspeed best wishes in your securing and recovery process
369173,no no you are all good i should be here to address concerns as im also a shilloor and a community member here
369175,do we have an etherscan linkedit
369176,eoa contract
369177,are we at risk if we used the nomad bridge
369178,probably if youre using nomad assets on networks like moonbeam evmos etc
369179,i cant believe my eyes
369180,whitehat contracts now
369181,this guy making a killing
369182,
369183,u think its a white hacker
369184,its not lt is belong to the hacker
369186,lots of assets from nomad on avax potentially would mean that those are now under backing
369187,probably not the main bridge so e assets are fine
369188,yes if e assets were compromised wed be in for a world of pain
369189,i will show you two of funny screenshots
369190,if the only solution proposed so far given the most recent bridge disaster is harmony just turning on their money printer
369191,nan
369192,nan
369193,you can fundraise 22m and can not create a long term security strategy
369194,
369195,rekt
369196,this is so ironic
369197,i dont see any on avalanche
369198,no need to do any more
369199,it solved itself
369200,thats not the problem the problem is if assets were bridged to avax and now they are not backed by actual assets on the eth side
369201,which assets
369202,people buying eth to exploit the bridge lmao
369203,when you bridge to another chain most of the cases youre exchanging locked assets from different bridges
369204,why isnt there a pause on the bridge yet
369205,sleepy devs
369206,nomad now a pessimistic bridge
369207,
369208,is connext affected
369209,
369210,how much was drained
369211,lots
369212,
369213,good point
369214,yes afaik connext is using nomad assets for its liquidity network by example bridging ethereumevmos
369215,so they have liquidity on evmos probably now unbacked
369216,were the xpollinateconnext team the same as nomad
369217,no
369218,nan
369219,ironically evmos pumped 20 as people sell their synth assets now unbacked
369220,trading at 18 now and was 15 before the hack
369221,devs on vacation maybe
369222,
369223,nomad and connext are big friends
369224,in the nomad ui they actually advertise connext as a quicker solution i thought they shared liquidity
369225,
369226,where should one send some rescued funds back
369227,yep theyre working together
369228,over 150 m
369229,keeping it for a while should be safer than sending the nomad team
369230,julrach
369231,
369232,let me ask
369233,should wait for comms from official account imo
369234,i was only able to rescue a small amount but seeing all the transactions i think others have a lot more to send back so thats why im asking you should setup an address where we could send back whatever amount we were able to save
369235,
369236,
369237,bridge is already empty
369238,wow
369239,isnt the whole point of optimistic bridges having high latency being for security reasons
369240,i think the rari capital exploiter might have made out with the most
369241,rug took over an hour and nothing was done
369242,negative about 16 m
369243,frrr wtf is devs sleepy
369244,that very rich this is a devastating thing to happen to any team and i am sure the devs are traumatisedif they didnt stop it they probably couldnt
369245,although not sure why the usdc wasnt frozen but i guess we would have to wait for the autopsy
369246,glmr chain is paused last tx 52 minutes back my friend was not able to do anything even though he knew about the exploit
369247,if you fundraise 22m it should not be hard to expand your team and improve quality of code
369248,yeah mostly curious on what happened was it dumb typo kind of bug or genius keccak spoofing thingy
369249,compound was a billion dollar protocol was a big treasury and still got hackeddevs probably have some blame in this but its not an easy you raise 22 m so woe betide you
369250,apparently you could reuse the successful bridging receipts
369251,hey sam long time no see
369252,yo youre a penguin now so glad you made the transition kek
369253,and their bounty was only 1m for 150m worth crypto
369254,
369255,how did they just pause the chain
369256,do i have this right other hackers jumped in after seeing the exploit
369257,that is what we are trying to find out evmos we could just dump to native assets
369258,they did the same a few weeks ago
369260,they never released a statement but it was bridge related
369261,dot and cosmos cant catch a break
369262,it was just simply replacing your address in the calldata the message didnt get validated at all could do this once per address so lots of people jumped on
369263,fr
369264,
369265,lets quit speculating our leader speaks
369266,sorry but i dont see any paused period
369267,no tx since 1 hr 2 mins no tx going through
369268,yeah not sure if pausing the blockchain even accomplishes anything unless youre fine keeping it paused for the week it takes to sort this out partially
369269,quite astonishing and im really new to this but how do other hackers see what methods a hacker is using on the blockchain
369270,cause some funds were definitely white hatted question is how much and how long it takes to retrieve them
369271,if you looked at a couple exploit transactions the calldata was basically the same every time except the destination address thats probably how it spread
369272,yeah waiting on official nomad address to send towards
369273,thanks for the insight
369274,arjun from connext here were the fast executionliquidity layer for nomad connext currently doesnt use nomad as its rails yet so users of connext arent directly affected that said mad assets themselves are obviously the risk our routers provide liquidity for xchain transactions holding madassets on moonbeam milkomeda and evmoswe reached out to our routers approx 75 mins ago to let them know to disable support for those chains this protects them from folks sending them mad assets to get native assets on another chain however theres nothing that can be done re the madassets already held by routers this is currently approx 33m
369275,unless they have a plan in place big doubt they had 171m in supply and 80m in borrow on moonwellfi
369276,the liquidity is borked already
369277,yeah and unless they can return enough to repeg the assets its gonna insta dump to 0 the moment you turn the blockchain on
369278,yeah most likely it was too late anyway
369279,whats interesting is theyre still producing blocks with 0 txs i wonder how they executed that
369280,substrate magic i guess
369281,moonbeams had to deal with a lot of borking upgrades i think stopping the blockchain is a pretty established drill by now
369282,do not think glmr team in total has that much liquid assets moonwell just a dapp on it funds are gone for all purposes sorry for speculation just frustrated is all
369283,yea stopping blockchains show they are reliable decentralised and uncorrupted oh irony
369284,lolz your decentralisation is not worth 200 m i guess
369285,ty dont know how i missed that lol
369286,
369287,moonwell could be another victim of blindly using chainlink tbhget some cheap bridge assets supply system counts at full pricestopping the blockchain may have at least prevented this drain of native assets
369288,moonwell is drained
369289,whole chain operated on nomad assets as moonbeam was pushing them to everyone as they are their choice of partner and wont go with other bridges
369290,only moonbeam can save this mess that they indirectly created with forcing projects to use nomad assets
369291,it bears stressing that nomad has by far the strongest economic security model out of any bridge construction however any system is vulnerable to implementation risk
369292,last byte was different too
369293,forcing projects to use nomad assets is far better than recreating the risk of something like ronin or horizon
369294,well clearly it isnt far better
369295,rollups can also be hacked this way
369296,would you argue then that we should stop building rollups and go with sidechains with small validator sets instead
369297,there are many different types of security risks
369298,i get what youre saying but levering up on unproven software also has obvious risks
369299,the contracts were audited with a 1m immunefi security bounty for a long time before they were adopted by moonbeam
369300,everything being built in this space is unproven software
369301,aave had a 89 fig sleeping vuln for most of last year
369302,secure development is about constricting attackable surface area but that surface area will never be zero
369303,nomad protects against roninhorizon style attacks where the root of trust is compromised it also protects against a large category of implementation issues too for example the near rainbowbridge which uses an optimistic model like nomad stopped a potentially massive attack when watchers noticed the attack and disconnected the bridgehowever in this case the attack did not come from transactions that went over the bridge it was an exploit of the contracts themselves on only ethereum this means that the watcher model that halts the system in the event that something goes wrong wasnt able to be utilized
369305,breakglass procedures need to be standardized in defi there should always be a failsafe switch
369306,a nice service would be an mev replayer that aggressively frontruns any tx that results in stolen money not a trivial thing to do but im sure itll get tons of funding and usage
369307,this is interesting thanks though ive always been under the impression that nomad has been a few months old at most given the tech complexity it wasnt unreasonable to think it needed more time to be proven
369308,requiredisabled disabled this line should be somewhere in pretty much every contract where an external transactions starts give the power to a ton of people to break it require governance to unbreak it better that someone abuses the power to halt the protocol than that stuff like this can happen unabated
369309,there are already generalised front runners that probably front ran the attackers transaction
369310,remeber the first transaction lost about 350k in fees to a failed transaction
369311,actually thats true a better action is to sneak in a pause
369312,is this the whole audit
369313,there is an artcile of some pvp santiago palladino played to white hack once that pretyy interesting
369314,then you have something that is explicitly centralized
369315,tldr he had to write another bot to try to front run attacker in the dark forest
369316,doesnt layerzero have precrime likely helps some
369317,
369318,was this the original dark forest post
369319,in the shortterm perhaps but not really as long as the ownership of who has that power is given to the dao its just the dao choosing agents who have emergency powers and can exercise them if necessary if those people misbehave dao can just remove them
369320,re layer zero using chainlink anywhere and calling it trustless is not 100 honest
369321,in the sense that the system is dependent on a dao and not a hyperstructure i suppose
369322,thats misdirection with no substance
369323,are you saying that having the dao have control over whether the contracts work is centralization
369324,i mean its prety dope tech but you do have some implicit trust assumption on both the oracle and the relayerregardless of whetther or not they are colluding
369325,yes
369326,okay we have different definitions of centralization to me youre describing a hyperstructure granted i dont think even uniswap would fit under that definition since they have the fee switch
369327,it is no more a hyperstructure than meta is a hyperstructure because they have shareholders
369328,not saying otherwise
369329,
369330,eth is my hero
369331,could someone share a link to ethsecurity tg chat
369332,this from nomad exploiter
369333,it was exploited by a lot of addresses this one turned out to be a whitehat
369334,daos are at best a rehash of shares but onchain in practice they are much worse the name is a complete misnomer no one would unironically call companies with shareholders decentralized by virtue of having shareholders yet people in this space have somehow convinced themselves theres some magic decentralization juice in the onchain replica of the concept
369335,so dumb typo it is
369336,
369337,well thats fortunate at least still believe all bridges are ticking time bombs
369338,this is more of a smart contract bug tho it seems
369339,or whitehat after the fact
369340,yeah its not clear actually did they explicitly initialize to zero or they just failed to initialize and solidity did it for them
369341,the tech isnt super complex and the dependencies are very minimal sig verification only
369342,this once again implementation risk custodyeconomic risk
369343,nan
369344,what does the dpos of the upcoming synapse chain add to this
369345,not sure i follow my bone of contention isnt an implementation havnet been through the code but the apparent mispreprentation
369346,complexity
369347,from what i gather they are using optimistic verification but with staking on top that can be slashed for bad actors
369348,oh i agree sorry if that wasnt clear
369349,normal optimistic verification already has slashing
369350,the synapse model is to have a chain in between that acts as the hub for all dapps to deploy to in effect this makes synapse a chain aggregator users deploy to synapse chain and then in turn can interact with any other chainin contrast nomadconnext is pointtopoint this means devs can deploy anywhere an have there dapps interact with any other chain
369351,
369352,
369353,how much can you spin the narrative after losing 200m
369354,was this me
369355,how many teams have a exploit plandrill in general like say if a building is caught on fire there is an exit strategy
369356,doesnt the hub design only have one potential chain that can be drained of funds synapse chain whilst in a point to point system funds can be drained on both chains causing one side of assets to be unbacked
369357,well connext and nomad are almost the same after you use the same protocol and are deep partners
369358,
369359,evmos 303000013024 000184886hl 3341431h 8618 24h 9920 7d 11277 cap 95th 6710mfdv 33bvol 72mshort on ftx
369361,bullish hack
369362,it is just going to go down nothing more than a pump and dump evmos native bridge was nomad their diffusion liquidity was added by nomad they do support several assets but mad assets were the ones with liquidity
369363,axelar now controls that route 100
369364,it wouldnt make a difference to the security model because theres only one chain that is the home for a given native asset eg eth on ethereum
369366,makes sense but that is assuming the home chain assets cant be exploited
369367,doesnt this bork defi on moonbeam evmos
369368,tfw the hacker just read the audit
369369,if they could be exploited on one chain they could be exploited on anotherunless im missing your point here
369371,so how impacted is moonbeammoonwell or nomad was not the main bridge of glmr
369372,this tweet is incorrect
369373,
369374,they stopped transactions maintenance
369375,tfw the hacker made the audit
369376,so youre claiming that samczsun is wrong about how this hack worked could you explain to me how it did work
369377,no im saying that fatmanterras tweet is incorrect
369378,this attack is different similar but not 100
369380,was root was initialized improperly in a routine upgrade
369382,in the audit they warn them that it would process an unintialised root they actually initalised it but set it to 0x00
369383,except that his tweet literally discusses the cause of the exploit a zerovalued _leaf in the prove function not sure if the cause is identical but verying that leaf bytes320 would have prevented this exploit
369384,had they listened to quantstamp who recommended doing just that this wouldnt have happenedall you needed was a require_leaf bytes320 erredit i was wrong ty sam
369385,hmm i see where you are coming from in solidity when you dont intilaise a value its set to 0
369386,white hat recovered 1m lol
369387,the real question is why the deployment config changed
369388,i cant say definitively but i bet a lot more than 1m was whitehated
369389,in this house we use custom errors thank you very much
369390,i just saw one case not verified
369391,1ofm is secure at the expense of latency its not without trading off ux the security delta between 1ofm and pos may be wide enough to justify that for some use cases but certainly not all but thats the beauty of tradeoffs
369392,fineer031i refuse to use if and revert it looks ugly
369393,thats not the bug
369395,in touch with two teams their native token we recovered is there going to be any official redistribution plan for whitehat tokens or shall we arrange return of funds ourselves
369396,i think i see what youre getting at root not leaf
369397,re nomad exploit
369398,yes proving message that had hash of 0 wouldnt have done much i think would be more impressive that you found something that hashed to zero
369399,if you can generate collisions for hashing to zero please tell me which create2 hashes to zero
369400,i kneel
369401,apparently outside threat model ser
369402,totally different thing
369403,he wants to deploy a contract at addy 0
369404,use it to exploit all contracts that did not do zero address validation on functions like acceptownership etc
369405,or in this case transferfrom on oz erc721 implementation
369406,if you can generate the zero address you will be very rich no
369407,you would need the private key to address 0 no
369408,looks like hacker generated a valid msg from a bridge out tx
369409,not via create2 then you simply need the salt to hash to the output address obviously still impossible as if keccak was broken it would also break nearly all ecrecover operations as they all rely on the hash input being onedirectional
369410,its on my todo list after monetising testnet eth yes im looking at you kusama
369411,you can circumvent the latency tradeoff without introducing custodyrisk using a fastexecutionliquidity layer this is what connext does
369412,yep
369413,will work on getting this from nomad team
369414,appreciated
369415,who has the power to pause the glmr
369416,folks who whitehatted nomad can you please get in touch with julrachcc marco_paladin1
369417,if there is enough liquidity on the receiving chain yes else use nomad
369418,30 min latency window 48 cycles of refresh per day on liq this means w 50m liquidity you can do 24b in daily volumeadditionally latency will slowly creep up if you start running out of liq its easy to track this and redirect liq in real time
369419,will do
369420,thanks arjun for arranging that certainly appreciated
369421,its all julrach tbh im just the messenger
369426,if you are a whitehat feel free to dm me
369428,it would be nice if there was something public for whitehats or something that would turn hackers into whitehats
369429,open to suggestions but right now we are working on creating recovery procedures
369430,not going to jail is already good news for whitehat d
369431,would be cool if immunefi created a generalized process for this
369432,collecting funds etc
369433,though quite a bit of dmg can be done with bad whitehats too so probably smart not to incentivize it too much
369434,it will be interesting to find out how the team will solve this problem
369436,i was mostly thinking about people who have money on their wallets and are thinking about using in case there is a public 510 bounty people could instead just return and claim the bounty
369437,cant really hard fork usdc dai wbtc on ethereum can you
369438,sure i think so but lets see how the team handles it
369439,no
369440,best of luck julrach
369441,if any whitehats would like to return the frax and fxs on eth mainnet back to the frax protocol feel free to dm me we have a no questions asked 10 of total funds recovered instant bounty its also in our documentation for reference you can have 10 of it as clean admirable and exemplary funds without having to go through tornado or other hassle
369442,has there ever been exploration on using native usdc as a conduit to create synthetic positions rather than bridging for example i want to bridge eth to avalanche i mint the value via circle on avalanche and that creates a synthetic eth position on avalanche bls remind me im dumb
369443,is frax in nomad
369444,frax is native to moonbeam
369445,thats it 10
369446,does circle accept such a function without kyc or similar
369447,not an upgrade it was set during contract creation
369448,no
369449,circle is 100 kyc and business only afaik
369450,im using them as one example
369451,how does it create a synth eth position though
369452,would you not just have usdc on avax at that point
369453,im trying to create eth on avalanche example without bridging any assets
369454,and trying to use perps to do that
369455,feels like it should be possible
369456,synthetixstyle but you might pair it with avax on curve to help maintain a peg of sorts
369457,sort of what im thinking
369458,sounds like lending
369459,sort of more of a perp
369460,i mean you can get eth exposure with your usdc by indeed using it as collateral for onchain futures or just straight up swapping it to ethe
369461,i guess it depends if you want to be long eth or issue synthetic eth yourself via an over collateralised usdc vault for both cases a lot of platforms exist
369462,could create a curve pool for spot vs perp maybe
369463,julrach have sent you a long dm with the list of things you can do right now i know it is hectic but if you have the time please go over them
369464,it solves the price exposure part but it doesnt solve the fractured liquidity partif i have eth on eth and i wanna buy smth on avax and i have no funds on avax the avaxnative synth doesnt help
369465,but it lets u get eth from ethereum to avalanche without bridging
369466,the perp also comes down to lending to a certain extent funding rate
369467,unless you have some different model in mind
369468,the most straightforwardless risky approach would still be something similar to a stablecoin protocol makerliquity issuing a synthetic eth
369469,correct
369470,yeh
369472,you could have a lending protocol where you provide eth on ethereum and borrow whatever you want on the remote chain
369473,with crosschain messaging its possible
369474,you could also have a pure creditbased approach little to no direct backing and you mint the syneth directly on lending protocols offer lower interest rate on borrows and have a curve pool for the peg
369475,as an issuer you would still be taking on the lending protocols risk sc liquidations solvency etc
369476,this is roughly the same security model as a bridge tho
369477,or some bridges
369478,but it requires you to alrdy have assets on avax if i understand correctly
369479,yeah starting point avalanche and issuance of synth assets in order to avoid bridges
369480,probably the bridge risk of what you are pairing it with on curve
369481,thats why my goal was to use circle as the conduit
369482,you can do it a la wbtc
369483,i mean if the objective is to have a custodian behind you can have the custody of the eth in full instead of using usdc
369484,usdc euroc why not ethc
369485,aave v3 does this no
369486,no you can this way only have native assets as your eth would allow you to borrow avax for instance
369487,
369488,i hope youre ok what happened is really sad
369489,whats the total impact of the hack amm pairs loosing value solvency of lending protocols etc
369490,i didnt know about this feature looks promising
369491,considering it relies on bridges you end up with same but different but still same
369492,btw do they have their own or integrated with bridges if yes which ones scuzi didnt look for info
369493,they are using chainlink
369494,for crosschain lendingborrowing
369495,chainlink does not have assets magically over chains wdym
369496,they dont have assets magically over chains
369497,you can have asset x on chain a and borrow asset y on chain b
369498,and chainlink allows to tracktransmit the data crosschain
369499,i might have missed it but what happens if exploiters consolidate money in a doxxed addy eg poison dao style ref nomad
369500,actually chainlink can allow to have assets magically over chains just went on the ccip prez
369501,
369503,wasnt asking about price feeds thanks coine_r
369504,not talking about the price feed
369505,this
369506,ah crap thank you me dumb
369507,
369508,got lost in messages wow
369509,connext uses aave portals as well the risk is the same regardless of whether you use a perp loan asset whatever you need to send a message across chains that controls mintunlock functionality and that message is subject to security riskstheres a lot of differentdumb narratives around this but the fundamentals dont change
369510,this whitehat has 1 million in frax and 25 million in usdc hes looking for an email id to contact
369511,lobsters lets send them a seafood
369512,chad move whitehack gib em 3
369513,cc ncerovac zhongfu cryptographic
369514,we will honor the bounty for all of it can you dm me
369515,if a protocol is audited on ethereum and they expand to polygonarbitrumetc do you think they should get another audit will the original audit suffice
369516,after this case it seems like an audit must be done each time after deploysc was ok but default 0 as an initial root deploy error was an issue nomad hack case
369517,there was a case where the way bridge handles tokens gnosis chain aka ex xdai it was either a compound or an aave fork allowed for was it reentrancy attack smth like that so basically yes
369518,im curious about that too
369519,audits wont save you from weak opsec
369520,council probably
369521,
369522,
369523,yup thx
369524,hey guys do you know what is the best way to get all convex pool addresses automatically
369525,hi everybody where is the best source for gathering derivative volumes from exchanges
369526,oh van0k oxmikko did you make one maybe
369527,
369528,vikruna
369531,take the gaugeaddress from each provided pool and supply it to gaugemap on this contract to check if there is a booster for it
369532,isnt this for curve only
369533,yes pass to above convex contract to see if there is a booster for it
369534,aha cool
369535,indeed
369536,thanks a lot
369538,let me guess u marketing ur own bag
369539,not true i am pissed off in figuring out the right audience for my product found this useful you can delete the message too
369540,ok i am watching u sneaky
369541,a protocol just need make up rumours about a token and theyll get plenty of free testing
369542,i feel this is very wrong way to get core users
369543,but i do agree that formal uiux testing is needed
369544,i generally recommend to have multiple audit than one
369545,thats kind of idea i was thinknig about as well but there are some cool things like eth rank where there is a leaderboard of contributors there might be better ideas of how to make it working rather then make it test to earn
369546,there is also lobsterdao hello lol helped test gearbox tremendously cryptotesters rabbithole layer3 smth
369547,lobs cryptotesters
369548,also you can think of working with zapper zapier if they want their users to get detailed pl not sure though might have to chat understand
369549,boosterpoolinfoi should help
369550,more specifically the pool is the crerewards field
369551,not the kind of testing you really need
369552,i think the code4rena model is very interesting
369553,yea they the best
369554,that is closer to decentralized testing but way more curated
369555,and also very helpful and communicative
369556,huge fan of code4rena their model en ppl
369557,performance art
369559,question remains who gives moonbeam the power to halt the chain halting simply meant that users couldnt do anything but watch their money being drained
369560,anyway dont let the eternal auditing debate distract you from the devops failuresbugs like these will always be there nobody can escape it only reason you dont hear about the dozens of stupid bugs faang introduces in their code is because theyre much harder to exploit focusing on limiting damage is much more important imho
369561,reaperfarm also hacked on their multistrat vaults around 2mil gone news not out yet
369562,
369563,no sir the teams are different connext uses nomad for slow liquidity in case connext doesnt have a router providing liquidity on both sides of the bridge
369564,no ser no liquidity is shared
369565,an announcement will be made via official channels you can also get in touch with julrach from nomad please dont fall victim of impostors
369566,if an implementation is faulty may the specification hold some of the responsibility maybe is vague or incomplete any list of other protocols that implemented erc4626
369567,its not a subtlety that you must own or be approved the tokens to operate on them
369568,yeah i think the same this is not a spec issue more a very newbie mistake if you ask me
369569,its an erc4626 specification bug
369570,i doubt it seems more like they implemented it from scratch and then did not review their implementation properly otherwise please let me know building on erc4626 right now
369571,it was a very simple mistake with dire consequences validation of the receiver account was not accurate allowing anyone to withdraw anyone elses funds
369572,so i guess make sure u validate invalid paths in ur testing
369573,ah its not specific to the spec at all then just the usual of people not testing their code im building on the oz implementation of it anyway
369574,its kind of weird of them to act like this has anything to do with erc4626
369576,can a nontech implement this
369577,it was just 40 people were not looking at a mass event here keep in mind that there were people preclaiming the optimism airdrop well before the ui was public as well
369578,oz and afaik the solmate implementations should be g2g
369580,never actually checked ownership in their custom withdrawal function
369581,at least they added noreentrant tho lol
369582,damn i need to learn some solidity everyones getting rich off these hacks
369583,udemy
369584,or bootcamps
369585,encode has bootcamps
369586,thanks ill learn and try to exploit xelements one day
369587,there is an protocol to do onchain delivery of derivatives based on fixed rate lending does anyone know of it
369588,try us
369589,tried encode but their pace is way too slow
369590,i heard nomad forgot it on their proof verification function
369592,lol not everyone is giga brain especially when it comes to playing with code
369593,im gonna try it myself am not a coder lets see if i can align with ur opinion haha
369594,looks like ada users also got impacted by nomad
369595,
369596,messari acquired an airtable website
369597,so now i need to pay for messari to get the same info that dove were giving for free
369598,the data
369599,dont think sodata is still here also hosted here
369600,anyone have thoughts on crypto price aggregaotr and api providers like kaiko and amberdata like what firms have better exchange coverage reliability etc
369601,guys what are some yield strategies on stargate
369602,best i heard was two transactions w high gas to acquire the entire stg community allocation
369603,anyone have good examples of apps that are using erc4626 or other yield bearing assets in creative ways
369604,so alameda had all the tokens and thats what happened
369605,undervalued
369606,si
369607,moment vestg dashboard is out some ppl gonna be too late
369608,the fomo sentence
369609,look at me i am the community now
369610,60 of the lows alamedas boss saved retail
369613,trading and degeneracy in kingdom
369614,airdrop for vestg
369617,lol
369618,well their fantom traction is really near 0 no point extending risks
369619,the decision seems super logical to me
369620,it would be if they applied it honestly across the board
369621,the screenshot attached doesnt exactly help the story that fantom is the only one that isnt worth the risk
369624,also le dapps with off buttonsinteresting very nice
369625,meh unwarranted hate
369626,is it though
369627,i know need juicy reward like on avax where aave is king
369628,dym why would governance not be able to switch on and off some modules
369629,then the msg didnt make sense redacted ser
369630,the problem is that there exists some entity that can switch it into either state
369631,well there is either that that can adapt and grow risks given or a full on stop w no governance that likes gets trumped by a new fork w a coin
369632,so i dont see how you make a totallyfinalizedprotocol in defi right now at all
369633,we already have 2 of those
369634,anyway agree on the biased argument there it was always visible from some aave core members that they liked bd aspects in avapolygon systems more
369635,so they likely respect those dao to dao personal relationships while i assume the relationship w fantom is very thin i am speculating
369636,
369637,but nowadays we normalize perpetually unfinalized apps especially if you have sufficient clout
369638,that dont grow at all and have a hard cap on tam
369639,uniswap doesnt grow
369640,ah that well amms rarely adapt tho do they
369641,curve is also final or would you hate a parameter a parameter is a kill switch too tbh
369642,i mean i get ur argument though its warranted in that light
369643,the fact that theyre the only ones with that property should make the problem obvious
369644,so not arguing per se
369645,their pretendao is thoroughly useless and that is a good thing cant say the same for pretty much anything else that claims to be in the same market as it
369646,lets just say u hate all daos pretty much w direct token governance and not aave in particular then it makes sense
369647,as it reads from above
369648,oh definitely ive been open about it lol doubly so considering the people it exists for our favorite 3 letter agency isnt even fooled by it anymore if their last scathing review is anything to go by
369649,which ones btw
369650,liquity and uniswap
369652,any one can connect to reaperfram team here
369653,is that a question cause i know them
369654,daddybirb is a team member
369656,chill got in touch via discord
369657,thanks guys
369658,
369659,how many centralized exchanges does kaiko cover
369661,sorry for so many questions but wondering is there a ranking for crypto trade volume per country
369662,would anyone happen to know this address they bridged 20m from moonbeam to ethereum through nomad a week ago and then sent it to binance
369663,multichain really is a shady machine though could be just lack of communication but still its hard to recoup the bridge asset vs native asset i always bridge to polygon using multichain tho bcause its so cheap so aave fudding their own friends using the bridge argument curious as to how much of polygons tvl is multichainoriginated vast majority i d guess
369664,multichain really is a shady machine though could be just lack of communication but still its hard to recoup the bridge asset vs native asset shady machine as in opaque or opensource afaik the bridged assets solution was not first implemented by them and this was only after bridgoooors starting bridging left and right and bridges were left out of liquidity most of the times giving a lot of users a bad experience with them
369665,mstr michael saylor steps down as ceo of microstrategy
369666,welp theres no second saylor
369667,unrelated
369668,microstrategy reports 918m impairment charge on bitcoin holdings in q2 link
369669,is it like a special strategy for avax founder to fud rollups with absolutely pointless arguments which re showing that they have no idea how it works
369670,he still has 68 voting power so actually doesnt really matter who is ceo
369671,i agree but this move was made for a reason well see
369672,the dudes bronkthe issue wasnt with nomads theoreticsl design
369673,as in opaque you cant really cross check bridged vs native asset with a standard chainetherscan dd and the comm team doesnt answer the hard questions there s also no info a re the business model and who provides liquidity and what is the profit to be a whitelisted lp still the cheapest bridge to anywhere afaik and moving the tech forward with the v3
369674,19b assets
369675,thats not multichain
369676,thats all crosschain interactions ie bridging an asset from chain a to b and then interacting with a protocol on chain b
369677,i m aware of multichain specifically as for dd stuff regarding the lp business model part i believe its specifically unclear undocumented at multichain
369678,ah wait
369679,i thought that you were speaking like for multichainapproach of protocols
369680,idk about multichain tho
369681,crosschain thats 2chains
369682,ok im done
369683,
369684,writeup a friend of mine did on the nomad exploit which ultimately came down to a faulty audit
369685,anyone have enterprise level blockchain experience interested in learning about how private blockchains are built for metaversebusiness strategy applications at large companies prepping for a consulting interview so any advice would be helpful dm me thx
369686,anyone know more on the source of this
369687,
369688,here you go
369689,with phantom thatd basically be the end of sol go to settings then trusted apps to revoke permissions until source is known
369690,agree i will put that instruction in the tweet
369691,cant it be bias since phantom is the most used wallet since funds are moving from wallet there is a big probability that wallet was created with phantomlooks more like well prepared phishing attack to be honest but not really familiar with how solana wallets work
369692,
369693,some people are reporting from slope too doesnt seem to be only phantom but info is noisy right now
369694,twitter saying solaland
369695,
369696,well is this the first ecosystem hack we see ever
369697,does anybody have a contact at snapshot
369699,if you have any solana in a phantom wallet please consider moving it to a ledger
369700,price is steady at 39
369701,incident update
369702,scary
369703,ask him anything
369704,
369707,anyone knows how i can run a nodejs npm online instead on locally on my computer
369708,stackblitz
369709,can i have the full link
369710,phantom connected apps are different on mobile and desktop they dont sync disconnect on both platforms as a first step
369711,
369712,somewhere i bet ivan is smiling right now
369713,ear to fucking ear
369714,saying to himself
369715,
369716,i warned you all now fuck off you shitheads
369718,
369719,nan
369720,broooooooooooo
369721,solana ventures got touched
369722,does anyone have their wallet address
369723,thats an unchecked tweet
369724,if people need victims of the wallet drain event i recommend the generaltech channel of the solana discord
369725,
369726,unchecked
369727,trust wallet as well
369728,i mean not sure this is actual for now
369729,list of victims
369730,
369731,
369732,posthog is legitimate
369733,
369735,yea we fudding them
369736,surprised lobsters isnt more excited
369737,
369738,they been waiting for this day since forever
369739,ivan sleeps but still with a grin
369740,he prolly dreaming about solana maxis begging for a job at gearbox right now
369741,this the end for solana not something you can roll back
369742,solana classic
369743,not even if private keys are leaked the whole thing is done forever
369744,the price started tanking
369745,like thats worse than the dao exploit cant just rollback and fix it everyones private keys are now public
369747,ahahahah
369748,thankfully this can never happen with metamask right
369750,lots of uneducated guesses
369752,ivan is really sleeping through what wouldve been the happiest moment of his life
369753,the downfall of solana
369754,nan
369755,funny you should ask there is the interesting fact that metamask updates are automatic
369756,wen samczsun tweet so we dont need to think about cause ourselves
369757,5500 users hacked so far
369758,everyone please retweet
369759,paladin shared an apeboard with all the identified hacker wallets only 5m affected so far
369760,seems smoll
369761,if theres a private key generation compromise at least or exploiter is being slow or more exploiter wallets are presently not detected or its not as severe as people are claiming
369762,are you sure its not a client side vuln
369763,isnt that what he is claiming
369764,your client is compromised gtfo and move funds to an offline wallet cex
369765,i will add new information to the thread as it becomes available in a real time
369766,if its client side you shouldnt touch your wallet
369769,great work as always ser
369770,i think people who didnt touch their wallet for months claim to have gotten drained too
369771,i agree staying out is general best practice
369772,but in this case it seems to not help
369773,no they claim they havent made transactionsif this is a client side vuln the worst thing you could ask from users is to open their wallets
369774,i still have my assets on my phantom wallet interacted last week for the last time with it should i be next
369775,i dont think this is the solana hackathon they had in mind
369776,yeah in that case that the poeple who say they didnt touch their wallet still had it in their browser i agree
369777,ill dig a bit to confirm
369778,htp9mgp8tig923zfy7qf2zzbmumynefrahsp7vsg4wxv 605 cezn7mqp9xoxn2hdyw6fjej73t7qax9rp2zys6hb3ieu 2968 5wwbygqg6bderm2nnnyumqxfcunb68b6kesxbywh1j3n 1142 geeccgj9bezvbvor1njkbcciqxjbxvedhaxdcrbdbmuy 276 total 10436000
369779,hmm
369781,no reports from my friends getting drained when they move to ftx atm
369782,so them opening their app did not cause them to get instantly drained at the very least enough time to send all their wallet assets to ftx
369783,obviously they arent dumb enough to wait and see haha
369784,hey friends what do you think about algorand one of my friend who is building a b2b dex there tells me this is the best performing chain on the market but i feel every chain claims this sorry a bit open ended question but i am really starting from zero with this chain
369785,relax my fellow lobsters their network is a mainnet beta this is within the scope of whats acceptable still
369786,nor when moving to any other cex or ledger through gui or cli
369787,perfect thats really good to know then moving to ftx temporarily is probably the best bet apart from hiding in plain sight by having your funds staked somewhere i bet those wont get taken immediately
369788,5wwbygqg6bderm2nnnyumqxfcunb68b6kesxbywh1j3n is not really active can we consider it an exploit wallet
369789,lol
369790,looks like it drained 2 hours ago i guess legit
369792,also linked to exploiter so certainly legit
369793,i dont think so
369794,he is not very active now but literally 2 hours ago he massively withdrew money from other peoples wallets
369795,yep also funded by same wallet as the other accs
369796,
369797,
369798,
369799,why the price isnt tanking
369800,problems on solano isnt new
369801,seems more likely its one of the new password jackers going around but doesnt explain mobile only users
369802,mobile only users seems like either phishing or supply chain attack
369803,yeah issue is that none of these testimonals are fool proof right
369804,if crypto anon says his browser wallet was unaffected its not guaranteed to be true yet
369805,some old virusphishing is what i would like to believe as well it seems like the most obvious case
369806,a lot of people likely store seeds in password managers too which recent jackers have been targeting
369807,though if its mobile only phishingvirus becomes less likely
369808,maybe the quantum computer is finally here
369809,lol
369810,phishing is equal on mobiledesktop
369811,oh like insert passphrase phishing lol
369812,i feel like if that was the method it would have been pretty obvious by now
369813,because these twitter anons wouldnt be saying i didnt touch my wallet for months wtf on twitter if they literally pasted their passphrase on a website
369814,are we certain that there are individuals on ethereum losing assets too or is this just solana
369815,from twitter it seems like most people who have had wallets drained have used slope
369816,i saw some tweets about this i think nobody is being affected on eth though
369817,sauce
369818,
369819,i got some money in a honeypot hotwallet i keep around and have scattered the seed everywhere and its all still there
369820,saw this wallet being thrown around as linked to the hacker hearsay though
369821,yeah its also a cheap method to spread fud right
369822,drain 10 wallets you preseeded
369823,not saying you did this but from a shorting perspective its a pretty simple tactic
369825,
369826,maybe but there are ens wallets drained that have been active for a long time
369827,good point
369829,hmm
369830,
369831,
369832,nan
369834,price of solana is going up what a strong community
369835,ridiculous
369836,when it happens on eth
369837,who uses cream finance in 2022 lol
369838,that moment i temporarily uploaded my private key to trust wallet in an emergency
369839,rip me
369840,solana at 7k confirmed wallets impacted
369841,shut it down
369842,unironically
369843,shut it down
369844,if it gets worse i wouldnt be surprised if they do
369845,someone was saying the current exploit is a good use case to shut down
369846,seeing reports that 4050 ethereum users might be affected could be a fluke though
369847,true i shared the exploit in the group first and thought ppl were more excited
369848,about to hit 8k
369849,lobster is anti sol
369850,where are you tracking this
369851,
369852,only tracks raw sol transfers theres a lot more on token transfers
369853,maybe people getting a bit fatigued we still havent had time to process the nomad exploit or get a conclusion from that
369854,lol
369855,
369856,ugh so much fud exist has barely any liquidity
369857,funny hackers stealing 580m of worthless sol token
369858,true degen
369859,like please drain all of my shitty sol eco tokens so i dont have to look at them
369860,whats best place to store stables now days
369861,feel like everything gets hacked lol
369862,
369863,just buy bitcoin
369864,a bank
369865,
369866,this guy sent an nft to hackers addresses and somebody viewed it
369867,it is not 580m it is something near 8m one wallet has a shitcoin valued ate 570m but it is fake
369868,really
369869,yeah i should have put 580m in quotation mark thought ppl get that is just a joke
369870,yes the wallet 3 has a coin named exist with the value of 570m but it has no info on coingecko
369871,fake ivan dming
369872,i bought bitcoin like you suggested and this guy was walking me through the process of setting up my own wallet should i be concerned
369873,
369874,any thoughts on this from this group
369875,boolish
369876,what is it
369877,sudoswap
369878,it is the next gen nft marketplace with amm
369879,live twitter space following attack
369880,its pretty neat
369881,nftx u sure abt that
369882,
369883,interesting trojan that
369884,i thought nftx does erc20
369885,yeap its a diff thing
369886,sudo amm of native nfts with cool shit bonding curves etc nftx tokenized nfts
369887,
369888,although this may be biased sudo is the true zero to one innovation in the nft space rn similar to when uniswap was launched its worth paying attention because its been making noise since it debuted a month ago
369889,
369892,why do ppl keep posting abt the luca stealer its just a script that automatically exfiltrates valuable data but the whole thing is predicated on infecting the computer with it unlikely that the attacker achieved that with 7k users which exclusively had solana assets
369895,
369896,
369897,can they as well stop any tx out from that wallets effectively locking it
369898,yeah i noticed that earlier and reshared the funny solana shitpost it is just nutz
369899,
369900,hugs to solana frens
369901,impressive decentralization very nice
369902,inadvertently advertising you are concentrated enough to establish a network level blacklist ought to have very good outcomes
369903,i mean lets be honest sol was working the best during its outtimesatleast 1 good thing coming out from the centralized and trashy network wouldnt be bad
369904,someone somewhere wholeheartly agree with you
369905,nan
369906,
369907,nan
369908,this was posted few mins ago
369909,did they fix solana hack already or not
369910,should rebrand to betanet neverending story
369911,lol chain halted
369912,i heard package injection attack theory being thrown around seems plausible
369913,isnt eth hashrate is also similarly concentrated enough in a small number of mining pools for a blacklist like this to work its just that nondurable solana transactions will become invalid if theyre not included quickly enough while eth transactions are practically valid in perpetuity so some noncensoring miner will eventually include the tx
369914,its very possible there was some malware npm packages solana dependencies in js have been some of the worst ive used
369915,never a dull day in crypto
369916,but the luca hack seems more likely
369917,wouldnt attempting that be the equivalent of what led to etc
369918,no why would it
369919,from the above ct thread the issue seems like from walletsphantom and slope on mobile than solana network
369920,it would just be miners choosing to not include txs it wouldnt change anything about consensus
369921,i mean doing that in a way that actually invalidates the tx
369923,regardless i imagine it is very much theoretically possible but the game is quite simply not doing it
369924,i suspect that if a noncensoring solana validator produces a block within 2min of the attacker sending the transaction and actually sees the transaction then that tx will go through anyway
369925,does such a validator exist
369926,maybe there are apparently 2k validators though most of the stake power is probably concentrated in a few larger validators
369927,yeah hard to believe 2k validators agreed already across time zones
369928,i think the main difference is that the solana validators are better coordinated quite a few of them are sitting in the solana discord after all
369929,posting to confirm if this is legit
369930,probably not as easy to get ethermine and f2pool and hiveon and to agree on things this quickly
369931,better coordinated is one way to describe it small enough to enable swift coordination of this sort repeatedly is another
369932,the bar to entry isnt exactly known for being low intentionally so which begets the sort of thing
369933,dont dump your seed into third parties kids
369934,but they can always pull the is beta card
369935,nan
369936,witha high enough fee a miner will take it its called flashbotsmev
369937,always
369938,would be ironic if their socials got hacked as well lol
369939,provided they arent actively censoring those txs doubt they will though and id imagine itd go against their principles
369940,if i run a farm i can just temporarily take my hash off a pool to mine a block with the high mev fee then put it back on the pool
369941,now if the other pools reject my block because it contains the censored tx that creates etceth chainsplit
369942,nan
369943,multiple ecosystems
369944,several security firms
369945,back when they blocked candy machine txes temporarily it was just with an iptables rule that dropped packets to the candy machine account
369946,lmao
369947,so if they were doing the same thing now it would still be possible for a noncensoring validator to include the tx
369948,with that said i cant find any evidence of them deliberately censoring txes the validator chat in the solana discord seems to be mentioning some entity spamming the network purportedly to prevent the attacker from moving funds or we
369949,lol its on their website also
369950,so all those failed transactions might be just a result of solana network congestion classic
369951,nan
369952,it is possible indeed it is how it should be which is where the is decentralized network gets its weight but is it a thing that actually happens in solana
369953,
369954,seems like it
369955,i highly doubt theyd be able to get enough people together to start censoring txs in such a short period of time either youve seen how long it took them to get solana back up again after the last few chain halts
369956,and even then you only needed something like 80 of stake power to be online
369957,isnt the bigger problem and a counter to the theory in that page the fact that theyve been able to get them to shut it down several times over
369958,this discussion reminded me of this
369959,
369960,
369961,shut what down you mean to halt the chain
369962,
369964,yes
369965,
369966,i dont remember any such instances though the previous chain halts were due to validators being overloaded and running out of ram or otherwise crashing or we not validators choosing to deliberately shut the chain down
369967,i suppose stated that way you are probably right they have never shut it down deliberately does that not beg the question of what constitutes a deliberate shutdown
369968,choosing to turn off their validators and stop validating voluntarily
369969,but they would also not be acting in the best financial interest of themselves nor their delegators
369970,nan
369971,correct
369972,except the one in september 2021
369973,after the grape ido
369974,botter ddos the ido so they shut it down
369975,theres nothing particularly special about being able to shut down a blockchain in and of itself i doubt anyone bats much of an eye when your testnets t1000 shuts down and restarts but when your mainnet starts displaying the same properties well is it really a blockchain
369976,nan
369977,validators running out of ram
369978,gotcha thanks
369979,not if you have a good enough excuse as to why you did it wherein you can then claim the decision had to be made did terra shut down voluntarily
369980,i believe yes

369993,nomad hacker returning funds
369994,was fun rted samczsuns tweet thanks for the info you all shared above devastating stuff
369995,been waiting on github attack yikes
369996,devestating stuff he writes with a smile on his face
369997,_
369998,
369999,id be more worried about a rogue npm library than 35k github repos
370000,shes a 10 but shes a solana maxi and just lost her entire net worth
370001,feel free to dm
370002,npm is a big hack at all due to its architecture so rate of this kind of hacks will only increase
370003,am i allowed to speculate here
370004,no ser buy the nft or unsell and join kingdom
370005,rats
370006,fineeeeee
370008,
370011,fin stop
370014,not interested in conspiracy theories buy the nft if u wanna do that respect the rules
370016,
370017,what are the best mutlisig or custody solutions for spl assets aside from hardware wallets
370018,best marketing ever luv it
370019,
370020,
370021,nan
370022,lobsters come in different philosophies bags colours shapes and sizes but theres only 35k of them so get yours today
370023,also solana is a scalability dead end that wont scale beyond the max theoretical performance of a single n2standard32 gcp instancebut they larp as if theyve solved it once and for all thus drawing much ire
370024,l2 on solana or neon
370025,there is one android user reported as well
370026,he was just using phantom on android
370027,
370028,i know this not related in anyway you guys should pardon mei want to askwhats the best trading platform for gift cards
370029,you want to buy gifts cards using crypto
370030,might be a false positive but looks like someone got the hackers ip
370031,
370032,mainly for exchange
370033,am redeeming
370034,not sure if this is a joke about the bfx hackers but bitrefill is great
370035,thanks
370036,
370037,this is a pretty website
370038,is there any threadoor around who looked through how much was taken from nomad not by the attacker
370039,also curious on the fate of the usdc did the hacker manage to insta supply it to 3pool
370040,
370041,still wondering about this the orginal thread has some good links but im looking for more good tools buffer kinda sucks tbh easiest thing i need is list tweets ordered by new followers profile visits
370042,
370043,posted above already apparently those bots are creating clone repo with 0 stars so the impact is very minimal
370044,thanks but i was asking about nomad haha
370045,ah wasnt replying to you sorry for interrupting the flow i just wanna throw that in
370046,ah fair enough haha
370047,omg use guild pls
370048,
370049,up to this minute no one still knows what exactly happened so that consider all theories as speculation
370050,
370051,whats the most plausible theory
370052,something something sloped phantom trusted wallet something something ios imported seed current state of investigation
370053,eddsa supply chain attack infected package or even worse like bad randomness choose whats the best
370054,no
370055,so a packaged used by the wallets that would be able to sniff on the recovery
370056,up until this minute no one knows anything exactly besides observable data from chain and evidence from affected users
370057,yeah i saw people speculating it was ios only but that got debunked pretty quick
370058,seems both new and importer wallets were affected
370059,do we have confirmation that wallets used in desktop browsers only were not compromised
370060,we have evidence they were affected we do not have evidence that metamask or cold wallets been hacked and thats all for now same with multisigs
370061,samkazemian dm re frax for nomad
370062,how many ethereum archive node are in the worldmost sources are providing info for nodes only
370064,merge date confirmed
370065,is there any proof of this happening to ethereum addresses or is specifically a supplychain attack on sol
370066,
370067,you lost me at the wallet pledges the users bitcoin as collateral to a centralized exchange
370068,dont think theres any such proof regarding eth
370069,was about to post the same thing this goes into depth from the tweet
370071,mom i want bitcoin defi we have bitcoin defi at home defi at home basically celsius
370072,jokes aside its an okay idea i legit think inverse perp positions are the most reliable way of making stablecoins
370073,its not that different from trusting in usdt in the end
370074,its novel forsure but relying on offchain interactions to a cex to stabilize a usd representation of btc on state channels yikes just build the smart contracts already
370075,bitcoiners think in mysterious ways
370076,qq i had a qeustion can i mint ens domain directly from etherscan how we do with nft
370077,all they need to stop larping is adopt the drivechain concept so that at least the smart contract sidechains actually have decentralized bridgesbut they wont do that will they
370078,
370079,my full thread for an easy reading
370080,linus law fallacy
370081,funny enough bitcoiners couldve had defi if they just let vitalik build on top of the existing chain
370082,they did it was called counter party
370083,
370084,is there like a thing where a contract can pay some other contract to ask to be called back once in a while
370085,keepers enables smart contracts to automate key functions and eventdriven tasks in a highly reliable decentralized and costefficient manner
370086,whats the best keeper
370087,debatable topic sir there are a few
370088,thats awesome
370089,openzeplin defender i find it more convenience than keepers
370090,i wonder if someone has actually wrote a decentralized fund contract that runs all by itself
370091,that isnt possible
370092,contracts cant initiate or sign transactions or pay gas by themselves
370093,by design
370095,you can use keepers brah read the line above
370096,thats why there are keepers
370097,nobody is that crazy i think but itd be a fun idea for sure lol
370098,an external nonsmart contract is required to execute those
370099,keepers are not contracts that run by themselves
370100,if what you were saying was possible keepers wouldnt exist
370101,on polkadot theres a project building an eventdriven parachain so technically you could ask that one to call your smart contracts at a blockchain levelbut functionally keepers would work the same
370102,so u could basicly write a eth3x fund coin for example that is decentralized
370103,and just take some fees
370104,you can do this sort of with mev baiting the botskeepers
370105,actually yeah just make a poke function that pays who calls it first no need to do fancy contractssetups as long as enough people know about this free money opp
370106,thats what keepers are which exist because at least you can just about count of dedicated parties to know about it and be willing to pay gas regardless of the network situation
370107,you dont even need third parties tbh but ya automating it is basically possible
370108,yeah the original solution used keepers lolyou can do an auction reward mechanism to account for gas costs
370109,you do need 3rdparties though
370110,contracts cant call themselves if you decide to do that job yourself all youve done is create a very nicelooking single point of failure
370111,if you had selfexecuting functions based on event you would indeed not need that
370112,if anyone can call this function thats enough
370113,if you want to decentralise more and pay rewards to call it then sure
370114,automation and number of points of failure separate points but ya you can do both
370115,enough is subjective the point is that it will not be selfexecuting or automated at the evm level
370116,dont think that was the point though
370117,i thought we were talking about a contract that runs itself
370118,yes it basically does
370119,it doesnt
370120,clearly on the evm level you cant but the outcome to users which is really what matters here is the same
370121,of course you can automate parts of your protocol with external callsbots almost everyone does that
370122,what youve described is keepers which exist because what you think youve described doesnt exist
370123,no idea what youre talking about now
370124,this is wrong is what it is
370125,a function anyone can call very much exists
370126,which is entirely different from a selfexecuting function
370127,i promise you no end user cares how you automate it
370128,were not talking about end users
370129,i understand the evm cant self execute someone has to run the tx weve moved on from that theres no debate here
370130,ugh it would be nice if that understanding happened at the start of this weirdness but carry on
370131,
370133,anyone here affected by the solana exploit
370134,please use ctrlf

370144,1 trillion owo
370145,i think you added three 0s there
370147,reported the account
370148,posting from channel name weird
370149,does anyone have any data on reorgs looking for stuff around evm chains and looking for proxy for finalised transactions
370151,anyone else finding that metamask no longer allows eth sending between wallets on optimism you set up the transfer but the next button never enables
370152,might be an rpc issue works fine for me
370153,wtf have they put changing rpc now settings networks pick network now just gives me bs stuff around currency conversion etc
370154,huh thats odd thats where it is for me
370155,ok when you go to expanded view it works but in the extension popup its borked
370156,for people interested in zk stuff
370159,for people having rpc issues with optimism this worked for me in the past
370160,if your transaction doesnt go through sign up for create new app then choose network as optimism name and all give something you want optimism mainnet then click view keys then you should be able to see https link copy that link and in your metamask change the rpc endpoint url to the one you copied it will be faster the public rpc is very slow right now
370161,wen arbi token need another merge narrative coin
370162,how can i deploy a contract and set its address for example i want the contract address to start with 0xabcd
370163,
370164,can someone recommend api to extract balances from evm blockchains and layer 2s ive used moralis but it doesnt support optimism and arbitrum
370165,i think you can use create2
370166,ya wonder how specifically
370167,will need a lot of iterations to figure out the right salt value
370168,
370169,also wanted to ask does anyone know any good portfolio trackers that work across multiple chains and with 70 addresses im trying to build a automatic multichain portfolio tracker for personal use wanna take some inspiration obv i know zapper debank zerion but they are quite limited
370170,use contract flag
370171,have you tried using covalents api
370172,
370173,what the fuck binance
370174,they listed an onchain impersonator which instructs to return funds to a scammer address
370175,does someone have contacts at binance to get this taken down asap
370176,pinged one friend from binance
370177,wonder if someone got paid to write that article since the source is some dodgysounding site
370178,source article is gone
370179,me too
370180,for reference love the ens ticker
370181,is this true or a scam can you share reference of this message
370182,thats a scam
370183,see my link above
370184,binance tweeted and shared this
370185,fucking amateur hour
370186,the correct source of truth for this is
370189,waat
370190,the entire article is factually incorrect and misleading besides pointing white hats towards an impersonator they are even misstating what the issue was that caused the hack to clarify it was was not disclosed as part of quantstamps audit of the nomad contracts the issue identified by quantstamp was related to prove an entirely different function the hack exploited process
370191,money on that wallet already
370192,scamming the scammers
370195,no ser
370197,nan
370198,im checking now with contacts
370200,this rumor seems to have a life of its own now
370201,they r on it
370202,daym nomad cant catch a break
370203,doesnt look like any returns to that addy yet
370204,nan
370205,oooooffffffff
370206,dude why fatmanterra is so important these days he deliver so much news he looks like a huge group of people working
370208,are they even reliable sauce
370209,
370212,sad news
370213,so what one account got some facts right and capitalized on hype posting more doom info why is this a conversation for lobsters redacted
370214,my friend hacked phantom wallet that never interacted with slope
370215,
370216,did they import wallet from slope
370217,no
370220,insane
370221,
370222,fat man has no idea what hes talking about
370223,no way this is true
370224,if this is true it ranks as the dumbest security breach in history but lets not be fooled we are all dumb sometimes some more frequent than others imo this shows a fundamental design flaw in crypto wallets mixing ux with security earlier today i wrote this article going deeper on this problem
370225,as usual
370226,remind me which protocol had the sleepy dev exploit
370227,this is not a bug in a protocol its a bug in a wallet maintained by developers specialized in frontend and ux thats the main idea in my article wallets are complex beasts with several responsabilities and for providing good ux they need to be updated fast deploy experiments etc thats fine for the ux not fine from a security point of view thats why the key vault should be extracted in a different piece of software and let frontend developers create fancy uxs and made mistakes without compromising security
370228,what is bizarre is how the sol community reacted to the attack last night they banded together to attack the attackers ddos causing the chain to break madness
370229,not the chain to break only rpc node
370230,oh thanks for clarifying
370231,there is no bounty for whitehats many people working with them have since come out and told that nomad is completely incompetent in retrospective if they knew how to do things properly they could have salvaged 5060m from the contract themselves
370232,any references to these statements
370233,they have to do that drag and drop your seed in the correct order thing in the frontend ni getting around that i think some frontend brain just decided to log these words in a centralized server
370234,
370235,yes but what if the front end that does that and everything related to management of seed phrase private key signature of transactions were a different one a much simpler one with 10 of the dependencies thats updated perhaps just once in a year and its developed by a small hardcore teamthen sleepy devs can introduce all kinds of bugs in the frontend app thats updated quite often with support multichain support nfts swaps or any fancy feature but they wont compromise the pks
370236,so investigation still ongoing i guess
370238,what is the business model for all these separated parts
370239,still investigating ofc but that tweet is kinda funny so i shared seems obvious but
370240,well that will depend the key vault app imo can be a pure open source project funded by grants since it has a small team and infrequent updates also its very important that stays open source probably it should have versions running in different operating systems windows linux ios android and for the frontend wallet now relieved from custody responsability the business model might be like now based on swap fees open source or other partnerships
370241,its not like now though they arent selling you some generic ui
370242,
370243,not sure if legit but damn if it is someone left a consolelog in the code or malicious
370244,we can maybe put the key vault part on its hardware device so it doesnt need to connect to the internet at all
370245,another component that its important its the transaction validator decoder that might be a web service with some free tier the responsability of this component will be decoding the transaction so it can be read by humans and detect scams and frontend hacks
370246,grantdriven really hopedriven development sounds unsustainable its not entirely the same but this feels like trying to separate password generation from verification the ui and storage there might be a market for it but integrated password managers exist for a reason
370247,good one but that would be a hardware wallet i totally support hardware wallets but they have a few issues1 not widely accessible expensive 2 you cant prevent blind signing at least in small hardware wallets you are limited to trust whatever the ui sent a software hardware wallet will allow you to copy the transaction and verify it before signing and other flexibility not available in hardware wallets
370248,youre gonna need a better pitch than software hardware wallet though
370250,crypto key vault support will be a great feature to add in my favorite password manager but it will only work if crypto wallets like metamask allow me to plug my external custody of choice with a clear defined standard now they only support a limited number of hardware wallets that have to be running in the same machine
370251,haha yes probably external custodysignature will be a better name and hardware wallet its just an implementation of the concept
370252,
370253,wait did you just say external custodied wallet
370254,the exact bug that led to the exploit was in commit 46d145 which introduced new logic that was not part of the audit
370255,external to the wallet when you use metamask with your ledger hardware wallet the custody of your key is external to metamask i dont want to get into the debate of delegated custody to a third party lets keep it just as external to the ui wallet
370256,
370258,i agree with your original point about frontendux and security considerations im a bit lost now where yore taking this though above all there is a constant stream of adoption which makes awareness and education a pressing matter that is the counter argument to pretty uis to start coming up with more complex inbetween solutions with contradictory names feels like a stretch
370259,hi guys anyone interested in desci herewe are going to emphasize on this new vertical through polygondao would like your viewsperspectives on this
370260,tldr use a hardware wallet tell ppl to use a hardware wallet especially ppl new to crypto
370261,
370262,common practice for protocols to just audit code once and then upgrade it without getting even peer reviews code is law not really something these new wave of crypto devs are tagging with
370263,i dont have a precise objective for this discussion im not into wallet development more smart contract dev but i constantly feel we as an industry are suffering the pain of this bad design decision in crypto walletsi dont think the user experience will be bad let me describe a possible user journey1 user installs metamask clicks on create an account and has a new option external custody app recommended tries to communicate to localhost7979wallets address for local key vaults if port closed recomends installing the app from safukeyvaultorg2 user installs safukeyvault for windows not a browser extension creates and account there user flow similar to current one on metamask it just recommends for extra security saving the pk encrypted in a usb stick instead of the hard disk3 now metamask detects the local key vault and adds the account4 user interacts with a dapp after confirmation in metamask it sees a message in the safukeyvault received this tx from localhost identified as metamask accept yes no yes any tx in the next 10 minutes verify tx in this external tx decodervalidator website5 metamask receives the signed tx never had access to the actual pknow the user wants to try a new fancy wallet designed by cool ux guys its fine he can be safe because this app will never have access to his keys
370264,its over https and s stands for secure or sarcasm
370265,thats just a hot wallet with more steps and moving parts we can spend a long time reinventing the crypto wallet wheel or just tell ppl to use hardware wallets until they know enough to be more adventurous
370266,so ledger or trezor
370267,im curious about that card one but still not in europe
370268,eh
370269,i think hardware wallets are too rigid limited and unflexible and provide a false sensation of safety how you can prevent issues like this one with an average hardware wallet
370270,friend of mine had some btc wallet that required you to bust a resistor or smth similar to unlock private key and it was built to resist decades if not hundreds of years that thing impressed me
370271,jesus christ thats some dedication to hacking someone specific tbh if you have a target that size on your neck someone is gonna hack you regardless just takes a pdf on average
370272,
370273,no thats just an example scams are everywhere and hardware wallets are too limited to prevent them the problem is blind signing
370274,a bit of whataboutism but ok no solution is perfect and yet for the average user a hardware wallet is today the safest thing to promote
370275,400 dorrahs whaaaa wowvery nice design tho
370276,i mostly agree with you with today tools hardware wallet is the way to go at the same time running metamask in a virtual machine isolated from daytoday use but today tools arent the right ones we cant keep blaming people for making mistakes much better to design the right tools
370277,yup sure as example can point at guardians and social recovery a la argent as an interesting progressive solution personally i dont trust my friends but iono even vitalik was into it a while back
370278,check the data of the metamask tx before signing
370279,what if metamask has a dependency injection hack that shows something in the ui a safe transaction but sends a different one to the wallet yes you can compare hundreds hexadecimal numbers how often you do it
370282,i agree only the most technically savvy and most disciplined will do this every time if you get targeted like this youre bound to slip up eventually
370283,if your assumption is that the host machine is compromised and that the user does not double check the output of the hardware wallet you can design whatever you want it wont work assuming you want a single entity to remain the sole custodian of the wallet
370284,yes you are right but1 my design allows to have the key vault and the ux wallet running in different devices just change localhost with something else2 the key vault component is much simpler that an average wallet thus it has much less vectors of attack im not an expert but running outside the browser also protects it from some attacks 3 assuming the key vault wasnt compromised blind signing is prevented running the human decodingverification of the tx with a third party service
370285,can i ask if someone please could send me in private an invite for ethsecurity thanks
370286,
370287,
370288,hot meme potential lol
370289,can someone explain why exactly any wallet should send private keys to any server in any way encrypted or plain isnt that defacto stealing armchair lawyers consultation required
370290,cloud backup probably
370291,
370292,where can i read more about what will happen during the merge in terms of assets migration
370293,will it all be done automatically
370294,there would not be any migration since eth2 would be the same chain just with different consensus mechanism underneath
370295,oh ok thanks
370296,theyre using sentry analytics for logging and errors so it seems they were unnecessarily or intentionally adding a new userto their logging and that api endpoint was taken down last night
370297,sentry like many logging monitoring frameworks have strong destructuring
370298,either way no excuse huge nono problems that were solved years ago for web2 are blatant in web3 basic application security and audits for logging output clearly ignored
370299,yes sentry grabs all environment variables and saves them but you can tell sentry not to send specific data in one line of code i dont understand why one would not do that to he honest
370300,adding new user to analytics by literally stealing their private key web3 logging we deserved and why does wallet need to collect any kind of analytics to log how much i spend and where i thought send crash report should be enough for privacy reasons
370301,hanlons razor they probably had the intern set up logging
370303,i dont buy it
370304,from sentrys own page
370305,you dont write a sentry error report for a new user event not by accident even the intern
370306,not saying its justified its bad practice to log anything sensitive about a user especially with something like sentry
370307,just poor form
370308,they could also have some backend crash not visible to user bug or something could be a mistake tbh but they definetely are very ignorant to the user security since to send sentry event containing mnemonic and private key one would need both store it in env variables dont really know how wallets are made but i assume there is no need to actually store mnemonic in plain text and not exclude it when sending sentry does offer such option
370309,i dont buy it this is one of those things that is too farfetched too out of this world to be a mistake and well closedsource does not help with anyone else verifying
370310,they did post their postmortem doc as a google doc link
370311,is the error with sentry or the application itself is the root cause iirc anything that processes private keys is meant to be sandboxed no
370312,when creating a mobile wallet this is one of those things that you have to be careful of for example in instabug if user does a bug report it takes a screenshot and shows steps of what the user entered that screenshot may be the seed phrase needs extra care
370313,not too long ago if you had even google analytics in your dapp you were punished by the decentralization gods
370314,application itself its not sentrys fault and supposed to be is the key term here seems they were in a rush to develop and gain market share as it was the first mobile wallet for sol that still had auto approvals
370315,sentry is less of a minefield unless you emit private key seed in errors it will usually just log only data you provide
370316,sentry can be selfhosted though and usually is decentralization at its finest
370317,the problem isnt where its hosted its what data is collected
370318,yeah sending private key to sentry definitely was not needed
370319,slope has been sus from the beginning
370320,yep like i said they have been cutting corners how did they beat phantoms engineering team and money to mobile
370321,
370322,nan
370323,securing sidechains with miners sucks tho
370324,what stops the same thing from happening to metamask though
370325,its not that hard if youre starting mobile first and cut corners storing private keys seeds in local storage pretty easy to build flutter apps these days
370326,all jokes aside anatoly is really something else guy never sleeps always responding to replies a legend if you ask me
370327,speaking of sentry is that not a metamask dependency too
370328,looks like sentry sends all consolelog to collection
370329,so a devmaybe left a consolelogwallet and the wallet obj included the private key
370330,roflmao
370331,seriously
370332,i had a deeper look at the screenshot here
370333,
370334,the private key is in the navigation part
370335,which means moving from one screen to another sentry will log the props you pass to next screen
370336,slope was passing the wallet object to the next screen which includes private key and the navigation event logged it
370337,omfg this is not how youre supposed to handle key material at all isolate in an enclavebehind api and only access via domainseparated sig requests
370338,hope all the wallet software can learn something such as supporting passphrase etc from this shit
370339,hi all ive been mostly quietly lurking but wanted to say appreciate all of the help so far here is a small progress update we just put out
370340,if any of you are aware or are in contact with any whitegrayblack hat hackers feel free to put them in touch with me thanks
370341,and shoutout to zawiasa for being one of the first people to dm here and someone who returned funds agtsi for the suggestions on recovery initiatives appreciate yall
370342,
370343,did the original exploiter return funds
370344,eth
370345,watermelon did return the 4m they took from the bridge
370346,unless there is more floating that im unaware of
370347,hmm he could be a white hat
370348,bitliq didnt
370349,
370350,theyve only returned 100eth afaik they captured much more than that though
370351,ill be trying to check out more information with bitliq in some forums
370352,hi everyone i and a rockstar team have been building a protocol for decentralised poolsclubsdaos wanted to chat with dao owners operators members and anyone who might have invested or been a part of a pool in anyway and get some feedback on the product
370353,we deployed on rinkeby in 2nd week of july and also won grants from polygon aave just starting to do product demos with potential users investors and angels
370354,react to this message if you want to chat more about it would love to share a report that we put up on milestones so far
370362,really good thread and breakdown of everything for solana
370363,
370364,we are starting a gitcoin open and decentralized science quadratic donation round upcoming gr15 in midseptember vitalik and others are joining as matching donors if you personally want to join as a matching donor with 10k or know of a relevant org that is interested feel free to ping me
370365,what you mean not in europe just buy it from the us also calling gridplus the card one is misleading the device also works without cardas the card one i would see more things like tangem or satochip
370366,
370367,hi i have a doubt what purpose will ethpow if forked will serve can ethpow be used as gas or it will just float as other btc forks withouot adding any value
370368,ethpow will likely stay the way it is right now as gas costs and old token model wo staking please ctrlf for discussions on this topic above
370369,ok thank my bad i didnt search it first
370371,i just wrote something debunking the ethpow plays you can do
370372,poloniex said that they will list the ethw fork
370373,wrote a reply to it
370374,i do think if someone pushes the idea and coordinates the removal of difficulty bomb pow spinoff does have a lot of merit
370376,my team and i work on the concept of the service for dexes which solves the issue of attracting liquidity and it solves it more profitably than own farming programson the other hand our service gives opportunity to dexes to earn from providing liquiditydm me if it might be interesting to you
370377,
370378,vitalik front run everybody on a zkevm article
370379,anyway 0 chances to understand it
370380,ye i am just sharing not even opening his stuff
370381,no one cares
370382,right
370383,i think i need an ai to dumb down his stuff for me
370384,also his tweets now
370385,anyone can share this research pls
370386,this zkevm article isnt as complicated as a lot of his articles
370387,but it would be great if he added some dumbing down ai widget to his pages lol
370388,big bois in stock
370390,hetzner ptsd though
370392,ive been hosting with them since 2009 support has always been stellar in cases where my drives died network outages or so overall i was offline a few times in 13 years had dedicated root servers with them and currently vpcs was colocated in frankfurt iirc
370393,the only issue i have with hetzner is the shit peering to a bunch of places
370394,i should get an nft from them as an og customer lol you listening hetzner
370395,disk failures for years and they really didnt like me running nodes in their machines have a funny email thread with them keeping my server hostage if i dont setup it up the way they wantbut im also a difficult customer so yeah take it with grains of salt
370396,slope wallet provider saved user seed phrases in plain text solana security researchers find link
370397,never had an issue have multiple dedicated servers running around the clock 3 years
370398,theyre free to pursue whatever consensus they want at that point also imho the economic equality effects of early pow are underrated would be fun to explore a return to those roots
370399,people see bitcoin as inherently connected to their chain but often miss that bitcoin could just survive as an asset and be settled somewhere else at which point pow would just have been a distribution mechanism
370400,which is not bad at all
370401,is there any tools or desmos dahsboard to simulate how much of a certain asset i would get if i provided liquidity in uni v3 ie start with usdc and eth with a tight 10 spread from spot price if eth rips 20 how much usdc would i end up with
370402,is what ive used in the past
370403,people could will that into existence yeah not sure why youd pick btc over eth then although i dont see it now either and the market clearly disagrees
370404,i think a gamified quasi pow would be pretty cool pos leads to wealth accumulation over the long run as does the entire world economy ofc
370405,culture around btc makes it a better sov
370406,
370407,then you win
370408,i win
370409,ironically enforcing a supply cap for erc20 btc is easier and more sustainable than on bitcoin
370410,first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win thats the reference
370411,ahh i guess its been a long way
370412,ex marine detected
370413,assuming a 10 spread if eth goes up 20 your allocation is 100 usdc and if eth goes down 20 your allocation is 100 eth
370415,l2 report vol 5
370416,
370418,sry guys pls drop a link to compare l1s by activitytxstlv
370420,
370421,oh thx
370424,why usdc doesnt exist on bsc while its on many evm chains
370425,maybe binance doesnt want it to compete with busd
370426,
370427,i dont think thats native usdc
370428,its usdc binance the exchange custodies
370429,that wasnt the question
370432,most likely as binance was busd to be there
370433,last time i checked bsc didnt have native usdt either it was called something weird like bsc usd
370434,what has a better limit order system 1inch or matcha
370435,is it safe to use this as liquidity its stable right
370436,neither are limit order systems in fact 1inch has always used 0x protocol iquidity for limit orders at least last year unless anton devs already updated it to their own cc k06aa
370437,bsc has too few validators generally to be defined as safe nothing is safe bsc is especially so for a thread on why we think this see here cant recommend storing large amounts of assets here
370438,how to reset the computer to the maximum to be sure that nothing will ever be pulled out of theremilitary grade
370439,
370440,uniswap going back to a centralized version of itself
370441,cz is coming for you after reading this
370443,still has second largest tvl in defi tho which is crazy i guess the fact its so centralized actually makes it attractive for some
370444,which tbf is better than the current state
370445,an entire org just dedicated to helping uniswap independent of the devs is probably a good idea
370446,imho this is the usual playbook of we cannot just sunset and say we stopped working altogether nobody gonna believe it but if we say a new unrelated entity has started being the main one we can at least not be under full legal scrutiny as we are not the main workers anymore style totally makes sense fine
370447,given they a identified a phishing attack as a contract within the univ3 contract itself and b fell for the nomadexploitereth pysops their track record isnt stellar wrt security my size is obviously not size but still
370448,see my latest articles at officerciamirrorxyz especially a cia agents guide to steganography fooling the kgb and protecting your crypto assets a view onopsec through the prism of time someone overheard me why its important to think about all attack vectors even if they seem unlikely to happen macos ios crypto opsec how hackers may steal your ethers and why does eth_sign function matter how to store crypto securely tips from cia_officer 2 violent attack vectors in crypto a detailed review opsec in crypto thoughtssee what threat modeling is and how you may apply it to your life shellsharkscomthreatmodeling wwwusenixorgsystemfiles1401_0812_mickenspdffor anonymity see anonymousplanetngorgin general i suggest using a 23 pc system back office pcfront office pc which is based on a pseudoairgapsee soccerspencomdefinitionofairgapandhowtoapplyitincryptocurrency airgapcomputercom airgapitand of course check out my own security guide it has only 25 rules githubcomoffcierciacryptoopsecselfguardroadmap officerciamirrorxyzgtknkmrdr_hhcqrnsenjqfpdhhb0w1m2svexdp4swcqalso recommended githubcomdecalage2awesomesecurityhardeningif speaking about antiviruses up to you to use them or not if you want to install a good one i can recommend malwarebytes
370449,yea i meant limit orders in the sense of matching orders which they call limit orders also matcha also uses 0x under the hood
370450,thank you very much
370451,we cannot just sunset and say we stopped working altogether nobody gonna believe itwhy though
370452,because they will continue working of course but need the work to happen from another entity both conceptually and legally then you are not one point of attack and have substance somewhere else
370453,ah so they want to continue working i guess that makes sense i was wondering what their lite fetish with bureaucracy and busywork was about
370454,i would assume this move is the new playbook and its actually not fake because part of development can indeed come from different entities ethereum style early days its a legit move but just a hard one to execute since its not a fake move u need smart and capable trusted people to lead these first movements
370455,lol an alternate view
370456,14m budget to give away 60m seems a bit high
370457,do we have people from nansen in this group if so can anyone please tag them
370458,ive spoken with devin the author of the proposal in the past i think this is related to their venture side investments where theyre going pretty hard on uniswap tooling im not sure i understand the need for another entity outside of uniswap labs my guess is that uniswap foundation focuses on tooling and other periphery products being built apart from the core product whereas labs focuses on the core product
370459,lol yeah that was my first thoughttoo much money lying around gives people ideas
370460,deranzxc this person is
370461,ceo is
370462,foundation non profit labs for profit i guess
370463,to decentralise it no single company behind it may be easier to pay out dividends eventually
370464,but also this lol
370465,al the above takes make sense
370466,and all are likely true not negative
370467,anyoneve seen any good quality in depth researchescomparison of different nft marketplaces
370468,honestly wouldnt mind if uni got garyd at this point
370469,no because then we would all get
370470,im sure fine cuz a16zparadigm bags but their gov theatrics is p centralizedorganizedbrazen all things considered
370471,daos make everything a public election who thought this was a good idea
370472,there are many more projects deserving of a garying than uniswap
370473,whats garyd
370474,as entertaining as the theatrics is at least its external to the functionality of the app theres not a great deal of leverage for a gary there cant say the same for many others
370475,what are you after specifically
370476,i think the diff here is that the scale is just crazy a former employee community member getting a free pass at 75m in dao funds
370477,secd
370478,lmao ty
370479,genslerd
370480,the roadmap is pretty funny first but lets have a nuanced discussion about this coming
370481,interested in overall features for users and creators and also tech stack analysis storage systems types of tokens available for minting
370482,yep we developed something much more agile and gas optimized
370483,what about selectively blacklisting tokens on the frontend which entity within uni makes those decisions
370484,btw recently 1inch limit order protocol reached 40 market share by volume among limit order protocols
370485,i havent seen a related proposal go through governance
370487,gas comparisons can be found in this article
370488,i believe whoever owns the domain then they do it but the replica of the interface wo blocks can just be seen in ipfs
370489,bad as it is its all in the ui which is within the purview of whoever builds it and nobody is having governance votes about css
370490,gary v turns you into a vee friend
370491,which in this case is uniswap
370492,uniswap labs if u wanna be very explicit
370493,tech stack is ethereum solana or some other chain storage is where creators decide to store frontend and backend are whatever they choose to use
370494,yes you could just make an alt ui my comment was about potential garying if you blacklist contract a and someone gets scammed by contract b victims of b could make the case that you didnt act in their best interestwere complicit but that argument only holds up because you demonstrated the abilitywill to blacklist contract a in the first place
370495,youll find a lot of comparisons if search for looksrare vs opensea or x2y2 vs or magic eden vs but the products evolve quite rapidly apart from opensea
370496,well the worst thing that can happen is forcing them to shut down the domain a la piracy but that means nothing of substance to the contracts
370497,fair so governance should only concern things onchain
370498,the most recent proposal would suggest no
370499,are you asking me what id prefer
370500,no it was in response to this really i think blacklisting goes beyond css and despite not being implemented in a contract seems like the kind of thing that should be voted on or even discussed before being implemented
370501,but youre probably right here
370502,heh giving room to that sort of micromanagement of a ui sounds like a great way to make someone lose their mind
370503,cc farm42
370504,besides what the dao thinks is almost certainly irrelevant in this matter theyre not the ones thatll be staring a fine andor cell in the face the best they can do is commission a different canonical ui
370505,that said turning into snitchiswap is worse than a blacklist
370506,uniswap uses a list from blockchain sec group or something
370507,thedao token contract for example is banned from trading
370508,its actually somewhat difficult to trade lel
370509,maybe they shouldve preemptively shut down the ui and let le community figure out
370510,really though why even use a browser based ui
370511,why not use terminal client
370512,
370513,you can build amazing tui
370514,cryptokitties dont render in text
370515,it would be much simpler
370516,i guess i dont see it as a ui issue deciding whether or not to start censoring projects surely has implications for the ethos of a defi protocol should a single dev have the right to make a decision like that even if there are possible legal implications
370517,well technically nothing is stopping community from building and deploying it dao probably could vote for shutting down official ui at uniswaporg in favor of community run frontend that being said most of voting power is in hands of insiders so not likely this initiative will gain any support from them
370518,lol true true
370519,for some terrifyingly warped definition of simple lol
370521,deciding whether or not to start censoring projects surely has implications for the ethos of a defi protocol yes should a single dev have the right to make a decision like that for their ui yes after all theyre the ones that will bear the brunt of a garying not people voting from the comfort of their homes
370524,gary and friends are not going to have a nuanced discussion about how many people voted to defy heh them and should anything happen people are going to forget about the dev after at best a month the risk reward is warped
370526,i studied the blog but it does not say about formatting under 0 operating system
370527,is aws still more expensive than google cloud if u want to do mmorpg stuff or is this a myth from 5 years ago
370528,why did infura pick aws
370529,what does infura have to do with mmorpg
370530,most companies use aws way more than just raw price goes into the decision if you had to choose a default solution its aws
370531,how do ppl move aave tokens to optimism
370532,just buy them on opti dexes
370533,no liquidity seems like only opti bridge
370534,hmm i guess wait for the team to provide some lp
370535,
370536,theres also bridging aggregators btw
370537,stuff like bungee probably others
370538,samczsun dm
370539,why is this man responsible for all of defis security surely the relevant stakeholders have more to say here
370540,dont want to make an issue more public than it needs to be about the uniswap bug
370541,that they lied about
370542,before fixing
370543,nan
370544,primordialaa
370545,the only problem with this is tha it doesnt solve anything
370546,the frontend doesnt have to censor any contracts
370547,the routing api can do that
370548,sushiswap the only legit decentralized dex
370549,routing solving happens on client side
370550,how does that make you feel
370551,
370553,tbh the same couldhad happen to any chain eg ftm bnb
370555,i mean sounds like a problem with the tvl countersdefillama has good standards for double countingother than that props to him for launching multiple guess not working if hacked protocols
370556,
370557,tfw you complain about endorsing yourself in the 3rd person
370558,ahhhh here we go again
370559,this should deffo land him in jail
370560,he is a top 5 solana dev in terms of activity they will protect him
370561,
370562,im top 3 dev on solanaaccording to my momjk i hate solana ecosystem and tech
370563,but that 100m fund he haswhere did he get it from
370564,just curious
370565,shhhshh cashio 52 million hack
370566,haha looks like the guy is gonna get few lawsuits soon
370567,holy shit it gets deeper
370568,
370570,how common is this in crypto
370571,well could be common but people just remain anon lol
370572,is it this easy to do all the work for 34 projects alone while maintaining 56 twitter account
370573,very
370574,cc farm42
370575,nice article close to airgapit in essence
370576,pfew you read fast
370577,reading still but from what i see thats cool i remember i read something like that already from another author
370578,you need in your life my dms are open if you need help
370579,what are the differences between this and rangoexchange ive been using that for a while
370580,has anyone encountered a bug with metamask where it seems to be wanting to send tokens to a random address youve sent tokens to in the past i cant trigger it intentionally it but it has happened a couple of times
370581,debank the bundles feature will be removed from the site on august 15 due to product adjustments why tho
370582,i want 1 for this idea what if there was a powcoin on eth would that be useful somehow it would probably interest miners
370583,0xbitcoin no no
370584,you might be able to let the miners vote on which chain is valid in case of a fork this way and increase security
370585,but isnt miners voting what creates a that sort of fork
370586,yeah but its a different type of miner
370587,so it would be harder for the attacker to fork
370588,but if the pow coin is just an eth contract isnt it predicated on the underlying chain progressing
370589,in which case wouldnt miners just mine blocks over trying to both mine blocks and make sure they include this pow coin progression stuff
370590,yeah they not making another chain
370591,they just mining for the coin which is rare
370592,but if these miners dont control the underlying chain progression why would anyone care abt what they vote for
370593,cuz if most are honest then thats all you need
370594,they wont mine for the evil branch
370595,why would miners of a chain care about people playing with a gimmicky token
370596,the miners wont care but users might care they can check the token contract if mining power has been a little off lately if so its being attacked
370597,hmm what does one have to do with the other
370598,oh nrvm i guess i didnt explain it welli think this idea is bad cuz you wont get a significant amount of miners so you will be vulnerable in a way
370599,there must be a arbitrage though supply shock of gpus

370647,velodrome is really poorly put together maintained private repo though you can see what changes they made in their now ended bug bounty contest no audits no active bug bounty and their docs are completely surface level when youre forking something that went as poorly as solidly this is just not good enough
370649,israeli researchers discovered the first consensuslevel attack on ethereumarticle comments
370650,
370651,
370652,2 years what does that mean for the claim that the constituents of a mining pool will run away if it starts doing bad thing
370653,the precise holes at multiple of 9 are scary
370654,israeli researchers discovered the first consensuslevel attack on ethereum
370655,who cares we are migrating to posthe day after researchers discovered the first consensuslevel attack on eth pos
370656,if this is any hint it would appear pos doesnt change the problem
370657,they didnt discover it
370658,it was discussed when bitcoin was being launched
370659,way back then what was the conclusion back then
370660,its a drawback of any proof of work system
370661,thanks os more to do with pow system then anything else
370662,51 attack can be real
370663,why is the defiant trash
370664,this is not true
370665,73 migrate to proofofstakean obvious mitigation technique which will solve both this attack and any other powrelated one is to migrate ethereums consensus mechanism to proofofstake pos this transition which is also called the merge 31 is scheduled to happen by the end of 2022 though it has been scheduled to happen since 2017 and has been postponed multiple times by now 13
370666,people should care because these vectors of attack are possible not the exact same on per se but still possible
370667,flashbots could have done something instead they chose not to acknowledge it

370676,
370678,everyone know we are moving faster than before most of it due to new thinking and simplificationdespite that i think that now we have a good flywheel ethereum reacts fast to issuesbtw whats the cost of delaying the merge a lot
370683,are you saying some background proof of conference call is going on
370688,i am kebob ser

370694,there are a lot of static docs that you can use and that are really better than gitbook for instance

370696,yeah i was just sharing it for informational purposes however what has changed since then
370697,dump questiondid they announced an acquisition without actual deal which it had announced november 2019 binance has never at any point owned any shares of zanmai labs the entity operating wazirxjust lol
370698,binance ceo says firm never completed wazirx purchase after funds frozen
370699,ann that binance is an owner pump users base because of proof that funds are safu rekt by indian gov
370700,also brag about monies made
370701,lmao
370702,theyre all liars
370703,hey guys 2nd part of our researchinvestigation of black scholes compatibility with defi infra is now live would love your feedback on this
370704,
370705,much shady
370706,the entire exchange was running like they are binance entity
370707,even had seamless integrations to move funds from one exchange or another
370708,not that there is a legal case they dont wanna be involved with wazirx

370724,political betting site predictit to shut down after cftc withdraws approvalarticle comments
370725,maybe augur will have a resurgence
370728,hey lobs had a friday beer thought with a pal and thought i would like to share
370729,i clicked the link am i hacked now
370730,ur are now hacker ser
370732,is anyone familiar with how the swapping works for stepn i know now they have their dex but earlier were they swapping via orca apis or some other aggregator
370734,was via orca not sure whats the latest situation
370735,i thought they want to build a dex themselves
370736,it was orca but then they started their own liq pools with 1 fees liquidity is poor and slippages are large
370737,only their of users are large not the vol
370738,will i get the forked eth if my eth is in liquidity pool lets say in aave dumb q
370739,might be more pertinent can you withdraw from aave if their oracle is rekt
370741,you dont need an oracle to withdraw
370742,or u mean all the stuff inside is twisted
370743,i have no clue i am dumb af
370746,
370747,yeah thats why im asking at the very least they should need an oracle to calculate collateral
370748,yes
370749,there is no need that oracle updates to withdraw collateral
370750,but the likely scenario is that after all mev bots dump everything for eth the usdc worth zero is bought to deposit into aave and then borrow more so you wont get out
370751,how does it know im not trying to withdraw more than i should be able to
370752,last price
370753,chainlink updates on 05 move or 1 hour or 45m iirc
370754,this will all be solved in 1 hour
370755,last price from where
370756,on chain
370757,aavepow will think eth has the same price after fork
370758,its not complicated
370759,so youre saying aave uses stale prices
370760,if you want to short stablecoins borrow dai and pray no maker whale test the emergency shutdown
370761,its all in the docs
370762,prices are stores on chain not every transaction calls an oracle but every transaction checks health of position
370763,pretty sure chainlink advises against using stale prices
370764,look if i privately fork the chain in aave the price of eth is exactly the same
370765,its not a stale price it wont be updated anymore tho why would aavepow know the asset definition changed lol
370766,still this is moot bots should deposit worthless stablecoinsstethwbtc into aave and remove all weth
370767,you wont get out in time
370768,i have no interest in using aave so that doesnt matter to me
370769,but i am curious about things reliant on chainlink
370770,pretty sure everyone recommends not using stale prices
370771,doesnt change very similar to this
370772,coming up on 10 years in prison its time to revisit realrossus sentence 1sttime nonviolent offenders who accept responsibility should have a shot at redemption our system should be about rehabilitation not just incarceration
370774,unless chainlink stopped updating thats a different thing
370775,probably not since whoever has the other asset your eth is paired with is going to dump on you asap
370776,right but before the fallback oracle hits everything will be over
370777,this is solved a few blocks
370778,it wont take 1 hour
370779,hmm stock up on then
370781,
370782,another targeted verified account scam attack
370784,there will be no flashbots relay on the fork so it will descend into a price gas war again
370785,this fact seems lost on many people
370786,there will be bots ofc just gas prices will be extremely high thus wiping out any potential profit
370787,still why would it take more than a few blocks
370788,infact i could see some bots potentially doing that on purpose bidding up intentionally
370789,ahh sure i think that if the fork doesnt act and just keeps the same chain running the replay risk will be big for gas war players then
370790,what replay risk just use eip1191
370791,although there are ways to protect yourself
370792,always learning something new ty
370793,to be sure i have not seen anyone support eip1191

370798,gamblers aka asian degens
370799,there is no fallback oracle as far as i rememberfor v1 and v2 its not maintained anymore and there is no v3 on mainnet eth anyway i guess this discussion was regarding merge consequencesout of interest i checked v3 on avax and polygon and on both the fallbackoracle seems to be set to nowhere practically having no fallback at all
370800,nan
370801,wow thats bad
370802,umm do all the l2s get forked too
370803,is any one here familiar with wordpress online store
370806,this guy is such a grifter literally who actually uses trx i wish more people in our space called out people like him who are just professional value extractors from retail
370807,
370808,use trc20 all the time tbh
370809,whats wrong with him donating to eth devs
370810,he is talking about donating to poweth devs
370811,imo he has 0 cost to do something like this its very very probable most protocols on ethw will be abandoned his support will encourage retail to think ethw actually will succeed and he will dump on them for free money
370813,i dont think supporting devs on ethw is bad
370814,or maybe pos gets abandoned who knows pepol bet on different horses i guess
370816,than actually bet on the horse sell all the eth and support his damn chain and ethw
370817,good riddance
370818,imma fork brainlet how would ethw be beneficial to justin or tron or is this just his way of saying fu vitalik
370819,hes supporting it on poloniex to get fees if its the only place to swap it its free money for him you should read the cryptopians the same thing happened when etc was created post dao
370820,free money
370821,tron owns poloniex fyi
370822,everyone should read the many escapes of justin sun
370823,its so obvious yet most influential people wont call it out because he has resources to screw up most peoples bags similar to luna spiral everyone will come out after he has been screwed over to dance on the grave
370824,and justin has a lot of eth to dump
370826,to obtain the guild maxi role in guilds discord one of the steps is starring their repo which requires access but that access is low level providing private repo permission
370827,nan
370828,thats genius
370829,trc20 volume for usdt is super highfastest and cheapest way to move around usdt in volumeafaik its their number 1 use case
370830,alot of chinese funds use it i was offered tusd before usdt
370831,very small difference between grifter vc trader buildooor nobody gives a shit about the tech and we are all here to make money
370839,tron is just the biggest irl interface to exchange usdt to usd
370840,i wish more people would just admit this
370841,but how would we get deal flow without sucking up to them
370842,meme so good they have to give you deal flow
370844,i know lots of people that care about the tech the problem is most of them dont spend hours a day shitposting on twitter they prefer to do things quietly in their own time but in an attention economy everyone gravitates towards grifters of all varieties because they are the ones who grab peoples attentionshu zu was the most popular vcdani and andre top buildoorsbitboy top traderin reality the best in class of all these groups are probably people youve never heard of or noticed quietly and diligently going about things in their own way as for money i dont know anyone who wouldnt like to earn a good wage but its not everything to everyone the loudest voices just make it seem that way because for them it often is
370845,andre legit built new things though so wouldnt mix him up dani was always a grifter and not a builder but overall agree
370846,tbh every time i go on ct wanna puke a bit cause entire attention is with secondhand memes and ct favorites doing shitcoin trading terrible narrative reading
370847,andre didnt build anything to last he pumped and dumped his way to a billion dollars by deploying half baked protocols that were never built to last his development portfolio is a shower of shit only yearn stands out and its success today owes very little to him once hed cashed out he abandoned it andre was grifter numero uno sorry if youre reading this andre please dont set your regulator friends on me
370848,maybe you are right but he is the one has many innovation ideas
370851,synthetix atomic swaps arent doing bad neither
370852,i agree with that and i also believe that in the end the ones that have an interest that goes deeper than pure money making are the ones that make the whole difference for the space
370854,
370855,memetic funding
370856,its real
370858,and another ideaborrow eth ahead of the merge against usdc if poweth has value then you get to keep your usdc on pos chain and repay the loan on the pow chain you walk away with the poweth and abandon the worthless usdc
370861,this would likely work very wellafter the merge most people would dump their useless usdc and anything else for ethsimilar to the madusdc dump the other day
370862,
370863,
370864,interesting
370865,lol classic lets pretend the lines are fuzzy so they cant call us out
370866,im an honest degenerate no access to seed rounds insider info just etherscan and some creative thinking i always fight for the little guy
370867,
370868,ah the little guy card
370869,not honest enough to pull that without pretending were all the same
370870,lol you have some weird vendetta with me ever since that little debate and i do actually fight for the little guy hope ive saved many out of scems
370871,well said wish we could nuke the attention economy world would be a better place
370872,imo most people start out loving to build and envision a future where crypto can change certain social economic political guards but then as they stay in this culture i think everyone figures out the truth its still greatest most fair game for anyone with some smarts and access to a computer and thats why we are all addicted
370873,its not that special youre neither the first nor the last to insinuate were all the same look at lilmoonlambox3 there but ill admit that post was funny to read considering the angle you were going for in that debate
370874,the grifters thank you for muddying the waters
370875,everyones a grifter depending who you ask
370876,good read
370877,grifters and scam enthusiasts love such pretentious relativism
370878,its true though
370879,there is no truth
370880,traders are grifters to builders making money off their work without contributing anything
370881,thats not everyones pov but depending who you ask it is
370882,go to kingdom for further convo please this is too subjective and you already expressed initial thoughts so not muting this is just a bit circleish sowwy
370883,there you go
370885,in this post i make these assertionsi contend the first should be the ability to sybil is a fundamental property of decentralized permissionless networks
370886,and if what youre building requires their elimination its incompatible with decentralization thats not necessarily a bad thing

370898,they are voting on it right now
370899,consider one of those exchanges is owned by the same entity that owns the largest fiatcoin
370901,
370902,
370903,rofl
370904,most chainlink oracles not even setup with a fallback
370905,people thinking its okay to make a fork when there isnt anything remotely reminiscent of a schism are the definition of grifters
370906,thats a snapple fact
370907,the fork will get taken out by the weight of it all
370908,exchanges dont have the rpc infrastructure to accommodate supporting it
370909,this also presumes that there isnt a well hidden trigger in go ethereum that would trigger a consensus level fault post merge on the fork similar to the consensus bug that was discovered and surprisingly detonated by an ethereum foundation developer for no reason this time last year
370910,what are the chances ehyyyyyy
370911,guys want to read something about team building online are there any good articles
370913,
370917,anyone here with experience of integrating the 0x orderbook api in their dapp
370918,i might be stupid but isnt it simpler to just use usdc to buy eth and receive the eth on pos chain post merge
370919,uqbar will apparently integrate an ethereum zkru directly into the urbit execution space providing a a native way for urbit developers to interact with blockchain ledgers
370921,its nice to see developments with urbit
370922,might go to assembly in september ive still been trying to understand exactly what urbit is for a few months now but it seems like it could have some potential
370926,yikes why would you do this to your clients
370927,audacious ill give them that wen blame the intern
370928,
370929,check the thread creative scam
370930,this is such an old skem i get otc pings every week
370931,
370932,we can forget about all the collateral lending shenanigans likely systems bricked to even pull out anything or swap
370934,given that everyone uses chainlink
370935,who s an expert here
370936,people are getting really creative
370937,just a small note for creators from my experience if anyones trying to buy your project tokens otc over telegram or discord its a scam its naive and greedy to think otherwise likewise with cex listing proposals marketing support and group mods didnt parents teach you dont talk to strangers
370938,
370939,
370940,i see the hardware scammers have arrived this shit very popular with hardware and they can be very lucrative i got jabaited as well and i had a lot of experience at that time be careful hard 2 find a trusted escrow
370942,what did they say intern is getting the blame
370943,nan
370944,deputy heads will roll
370945,nan
370946,think this one
370947,yeah thats the one
370948,intern meta has gone too farbls just own up to the error in judgment
370949,lol
370950,
370951,intern
370953,funny how it is always an intern
370954,nan
370956,hedging with plural blame next snafu on the pool of interns
370957,should just tweet out a fake nft link and say they got hacked
370958,i dont get the tweet
370959,digging themselves deeper and deeper
370960,maybe this intern will also get fired
370961,time to start a purge at quantstamp how can you trust your interns not to go rogue
370962,what will be the chaid id of ethpow and ethpos in the first block after merge
370963,pow will be the same iirc
370964,not sure though
370965,ethpos chainid will be 1 the bosses have decided thisethpow will have a new chainid
370966,cant ethpow miners decide to also keep chainid as 1
370967,are there any issues arising for mainnet if too many miners leave the network is there a threshold of miners we need to have on mainnet when we merge
370968,probably they mean leveraging
370969,network id is used in node connecting with each other and chain id is used to separate chains so if network id is different i guess both could have same chain id since they dont talk to each other
370970,
370971,nobody will list it without replay protection and they need to fork anyway to defuse the difficulty bomb otherwise the chain is doa
370972,does this mean 3 different companies reviewed same code
370973,if you update the chain id or network id of existing nodes they can no longer peer with other nodes in the network nodes need to have a matching genesis file including the chain id in order to peer in this case youre effectively running two chains that cant communicate with each other
370974,bet therell be someone relaying transactions between both chains for shits and giggles though
370975,yes but they reviewed a bit different things i recommend to read through the actual audit reports
370976,thanks will do tonight
370977,any chance that 51 of the minersnode operator refuses to update to the latest eth main net client
370978,classic
370979,it wont be an issue if miners dont upgrade
370980,only staking nodes need to upgrade to understand ttd cutover right mining nodes dont need to do anything
370981,yeah and theyll also need to run an el client for each cl node if theyre not already doing so
370982,
370983,fud or true
370984,
370986,why does everyone forget this fact
370987,truish
370988,for a juicy thread see taruns op
370989,
370990,top crypto communities in telegram
370991,lobsterdao its pretty obvious
370992,
370993,sovsignal had a great compilation as well to my mind
370994,no alpha in here anymore
370995,gota buy a lobs for alfa
370996,nah just more of the same
370997,yes heres the list from my compendium
370998,last time a new protocol launched was 6 months ago meanwhile the alpha has been only when deciding whether to breed your ape with a dog or with a jelly fish idk i am biased though
370999,all in kingdom nowadays ivan shuts down our shillings in main go buy a lobster if you havent already
371000,best alfa recently has been aave incentives and usdd leveraged farming is 30 on bothaave v3 on avax long dai short usdc 33x leverage on about 1 base returnusdd about 94 yield currently with 56x leverage
371001,watcher bot is back onlinethanks a lot to the person or people who fixed it
371003,did you post this from your solana phone ser
371004,timeless launched a few weeks ago
371005,thats a new protocol
371006,what is it with crypto projectsvcscompanies blaming interns for pr every time ribbon binance lmfao
371008,same reason they pretend to get hacked when they want to exit with your money
371009,enough with blabla here
371010,gonna literally ban people no mutes
371011,they hire them for memes and to be down with the community but they want everyone to be woke and nice and not offend anyone its never gonna work
371013,wait really
371014,litterally every startup does it
371015,sometimes its funny but its not when things are actually serious
371016,its poor taste for quantstamp to use the intern meta digging a deeper hole for themselves
371017,yes agree w everything
371018,here is vasiliy summarizing both sides
371019,
371020,aaaand now moving on thanks fin
371023,hi can someone explain how to get leverage by using lending protocols
371025,you can either arb leverage that means loan and borrow recursively the same asset type like if dai has 5 deposit apy and usdc has 3 borrow apy you can just deposit dai borrow usdc swap that usdc to dai deposit dai and again at every step your size becomes smaller but overall aggregate position is larger basically you are arbitraging endogenous supply rates within a protocol that was done a lot recently with stetheth on aave for example just arbing ratesor you can enter a leveraged position by putting in eth borrowing dai buying more eth again with dai putting dai back in that is to enter a leveraged long its usually inferior to perp offerings these days anyway but indexcoop used it for their token leveraged positions for a long time yet so far just dpi defi index kicked offor you can just use gearbox eyes and be able to do that more getting your yields exogenously aka use a few protocols with leverage at a time
371026,sacrificing my lobster for the shill
371027,to go longget your coin supply it to aavecompound borrow some usd swap it into your coin and supply that to aavecompound do it 56 times until you reach the max of 3x leverage more or lessto go shortget usd supply to aavecompound borrow the coin you want to short sell it for usd supply the usd to aavecompound borrow more coins sell them re supply etcor use gearbox to do it faster as ivangbi will tell you
371029,thanks how would this work in terms of the ethpow trade concept
371030,the issue with that trade concept is its likely not alpha the easiest way to do is go put a stable or btc into compoundaaveetc borrow eth and just keep it and wait for ethalik to fork the issue is likely a second after fork people will sell their eth quite likely so that your position would go down and you would be underwater with the asset on hands even if you sell the extra eth on the fork cause on the main chain you still need to return your stable
371031,likely try to go with an asset that is very tightly correlated to eth so if eth drops your collateral drops with it
371032,so going with a stable is risky going with some semishitcoin major enough is less risky maybe idk
371033,please everyone correct me whatever i missed
371034,if you dont sell your eth youre not short
371035,i am literally so fking retarded
371036,what would happen is that your collat is insta worth 0 on the fork chain so you get liquidated but you get to keep the forked eth anyway
371037,so ye is a free trade but its unlikely youll get anything idk thats the trading aspect we dont do that here in kingdom aka pinned
371038,actually a good question that i dont have an immediate answer to what happens to the chainlink price feeds and how will aavecomp reactwe know chainlink will stop publishing on the fork chain do the protocols just read last price forever
371039,if thats true then mev bots will definitely buy cheap unpegged usd supply it and clear out the protocol of all the ethw
371041,chainlink said they will not support fork
371042,i believe protocol do just read last price forever unless protocol make some shenanigans to chainlink otherwise
371043,protocols should stop reading after the heartbeat period has passed pretty sure aave checks for liveliness of data eg btceth on mainnet has 1h so theoretically it should be over in that timeframe there are theoretically fallback oracles for aave but they are not maintained for v1 v2 as per documentation v3 also doesnt seem to have any fallbacks anymore as all of them were pointed to 0x0 roughly 3 months ago
371044,doesnt matter tho liquidity will only be on poloniex or other scamchanges so justin will approve his own deposits first dump the shit and be done right
371045,if you simply buy eth now wouldnt it be much simpler as you would still get your eth on the fork so in essence you would have both ethpow and ethpos i am retarded btw
371046,yes this thats very trivial
371047,1h should be plenty to clear it all out will be some mev fuckery to watch
371048,kinda depends when the last update on those pairs was
371049,yeah youd do the borrow eth trick only if you want zero price exposure in the meantime
371050,if btceth updated last 55 minutes ago and then the merge happens then there is theoretically only 5 mins before the value is not accepted anymore
371051,but you multiply your money if you supply usdc and borrow ethsince on eth pos you keep it all 1x usdc and 08 ethon ethpow you get 08 ethpow 0802 or less ethso yeah not that big of an upside but still
371052,wouldnt you still be exposed because of the liquidation prospect
371053,and what happens to mev flashbots most likely wouldnt support it so it just miners left to do it and first in first out for searchers
371054,most likely ye its all a cynical trade to dump free money on plebs
371055,you could yeah but unlikely to happen and you can always return the eth if youre getting close to liquidation
371056,old fashioned way with gas wars i guess
371057,how d u be getting close tho
371058,im still confused about what you mean by zero price exposure
371059,if eth pumps hard meanwhile you dont lose money because you still have the eth but the protocol doesnt know that
371060,basically you have eth but you dont care about what its price is doing you need to give back x eth and you have that x eth in your wallet at all times
371061,why would that be relevat though
371062,i mean between now and the merge if theres any pump shenanigans
371063,sorry why that is relevant still me slow
371064,same
371065,the guy asked what happens if you get liquidated when you borrow eth and dont sell it you can because the protocol sees eth going up in price and eating your collateral but in reality since you still have the eth you can always return it and not lose money
371066,my smol dont understand why alfa isnt to just buy and hold eth to get ethpow instead of complicated borrowing operations pls explain simply i retard
371067,but returning eth defeats the whole purpose
371068,heres the alfa for your smol brain the more you talk about ethpow the more your brain will shrink
371069,you bear and afraid eth dumps between now and merge but you wanna get free fork money anywayyou do this borrow thing so that you have eth without caring if it dumps
371070,then your reopen the position with less ethmore usd collateral
371071,so this position is a hedge from eth dumping post merge meanwhile getting free ethpow
371072,not a hedge but kinda a play
371073,you can because the protocol sees eth going up in price and eating your collateral whats this referring to
371074,why you can get liquidated
371075,yeah its just to hedge eth you can also use this trick to join shitcoin farms
371076,why again
371077,on ethereum
371078,everywhere any time theres a token you can farm with and also borrow you can do this
371079,protocol doesnt know you still have the eth in the wallet so it treats it as a normal eth short
371080,or youre referring to the merge play yeah its only for the eth side on the fork chain your position will prob get insta liquidated cause usdfork is worth 0 so you lose the hedge but keep the ethw
371081,yes so why did u correct me here shvandrew ps ha yes yes
371082,could you explain more im not clear
371083,depends on your collateral which might be worth less
371084,and also if they have functioning oracles
371085,i think its because youre thinking about going long on eth ie supply it to the protocol if you supply stables and borrow eth you cant get liquidated if it dumps so its all gucci
371086,prob better to stop here or else ivan gets angry about price talk
371087,ye lets continue how i make money in kingdom enough here
371089,does anyone know a reliable web3 project for placing bets on esports with crypto ofc
371090,were creating one cryptonarratives
371091,thats great i looked after stake and 1xbit1
371092,its still too web12
371093,i think it should look more like a dex or a protocol than anything
371095,yeah completely agreed about dex style
371096,surprised theres not a very prominent one already
371097,were launching ours on the back of an esports web3 moba game were releasing
371098,there have been attempts theyre either illegal or regulated into obscurity
371099,interesting would love to chat with anyone thinking about decentralized betting markets particularly within esports dm me
371100,what happened to augurpolymarket etc
371101,funny because you can 100x leverage on pancakeswap theres binary options but you cant bet
371102,lulz
371103,not sure but with augur i always assumed that crypto markets were more exciting for gamblers and hedgers werent interested in crypto risk
371104,thus never took off
371105,
371106,augur has for better or worse never been popular enough to be relevant
371107,usa users cant access pancakeswapfinance
371108,i never thought about it
371109,nope
371110,is the cosmos ecosystem actually interoperable or not yet
371111,through evmos
371116,via ibc protocols and networks
371117,this
371119,
371120,azuro protocol is doing this with bookmaker on gnosis chain
371126,should check out overtime markets which is built on thales
371127,
371128,hilarious
371134,i am shook because i randomly stumbled upon the original video on youtube earlier today before seeing this ct one so confused i guess i am in a simulation confirmed
371136,buyourbags
371137,with the whole eth pow vs pos drama im curious how an immutable stable like liquidity will handle that if theres a fork itll exist twice liquidity only uses eth as collateral so theoretically they could just fork the entire tvl and have it exist twice im guessing that there would be massive liquidations on the chain thats not the real eth since price would probably dump
371138,dai seems even more complex since its multi collateral a lot of which is centralized and will be worthless on the other chain
371139,could be an interesting opportunity for liquidity actually they could become the stable of the other chain if it unwinds somewhat gracefully and they would default support it from day 1 i assume
371140,are these updated numbers
371141,oh wait its according to crunchbase cool
371142,likely lower now but i would assume at least 50 of the quoted sum is correct
371143,liquity theyre using both chainlink and tellor as oracles and chainlink says theyre not supporting any ethereum forksif tellor does the same thing then no liquidations will happen at all no
371144,yeah but we deployed a lot of capital in h1 2022i think the number is something close to 20b
371145,great point i didnt even think through the oracle implications so what would happen to liquidity on pow if neither oracle supports it i know their contracts are immutable so im assuming theres no way to to add a different one what does liquidity do if the oracles both break
371146,interesting that chain link usdc and usdt 3 centralized entities effectively end up making the decision which eth chain will stay functional and wont nuke hard due to a freezing of oracles and liquidity
371147,it uses the last known good price
371148,even if they dont change the chainid the best that anyone can do would be to relay the oracle update txes for eth price to any forks i think
371149,well thats somewhat worrisome assuming you care for pow eth
371150,i guess they can just use he justin suns algostable
371151,narrator nobody cares about pow eth
371152,oh i very much care in the sense that i think itll be an absolutely fascinating case study in what happens if usdc and usdt suddenly cease to work be backed will be interesting to see how liquidity reacts and how fast price nukes because of it good to know if theres ever a large scale black swan event in a centralized stable
371153,is there anything to be learned from that
371154,
371155,you can protect by checking for uncle blocks
371156,if the tx is routed through a check for prev block uncle hash and its not undefined your are on pow eth
371157,post merge there are no uncles so you wont be able to have a result
371158,do all blocks have corresponding uncle blocks
371159,nope
371160,is that even something you can get from inside the evm
371161,maybe you can check for difficulty but even that isnt foolproof
371162,
371163,all these talks about poweth why cant we assume that poweth will worth zero
371164,the above is a technical user specification not some trading talk please refer to trading in kingdom before i send my polish friends to your house cheers
371166,anything fork money related can now be found via ctrlf as we went through it all already probably
371167,it will be aliased to the new randao opcode
371168,yeah hence it wont be foolproof
371169,hi lobsters how do you go about securing private keys on blockchain nodes are there any devops security systems for crypto projects how can you separate servers setup from exposing sensitive private keys say for new employees
371170,is there smth to worry about
371171,heard that euler got exploited not sure not confirmed tho
371172,oh no thats too bad ser youve got a source
371173,he deposited 15 weth as collateral borrow 31000 ctx and withdrew his weth collateral againaddress funded by tornado cash and eth from selling ctx also going straight to tornado cash
371174,its in the original post with etherscan link
371175,still looking but to me it looks like euler finance got exploited by this address
371177,31k ctx sold for 47 eth
371178,isolated to ctx holders
371179,looks like oracle manipulation
371180,yep isolated to ctx lenders
371181,yeah uni v3 lp oracle
371182,our oracle rating ranks it as high risk of manipulation and shows it would cost 10 to move the price down by 20
371183,nan
371187,
371188,euler gang got this
371189,dont fade my bro michael on your life
371190,afai remember the ctx deposit was playing with gauge before right
371191,i wonder if theres any history
371192,no i just checked and they werent
371193,yeah was thinking that maybe the lender was trying to play with the gauge and got careless
371194,possible that they were considering going in that direction but so far no evidence of that there were two impacted depositors it seems
371195,
371196,yea they are nuking all their online presence
371197,
371198,no mystery for me
371200,
371205,is this the cefi version of a rug pull
371206,tbf i think its the best example of euler working as intended while sad users should be aware of those of the risks associated with any pair with a low quality oracle
371207,isnt it same for the rari before
371208,no
371209,because on fuse this would have impacted the pool as a whole
371210,this just impacted ctx only
371211,they took a loan of ctx as if ctx was worth 000000000001 and then never repaid
371212,when that market was checked against univ3 twap the correct pricing was indeed 000000000001
371213,in lending markets like compound raris fuse or aave if you introduce a bad collateral it can drain your whole protocol thats why its tokengated via governance on euler anyone can add an isolated pair and if the oracle is easily manipulable it will get exploited but losses will be contained within that pair alone
371214,every pool was diffrent so is same same to me
371215,aave v3 has isolated pairs also afaik
371216,there is just more segregation isolation here so ofc the spillage was shorter
371217,not a platforms fault but a product offering as such does not make longtail usable
371218,yeah and also euler does inform oracle risk much better in terms of ux
371219,also adding longtail with 100k usd volume doesnt make much sense for a dao to take risk with
371220,again neither is the fault just speculating on adoptioooon
371221,but pools like tetras one can attract a lot of capital
371222,there will most likely not be a pool with just 150k in it
371223,there are several lending pairs that can be used on euler that no one else is currently supporting
371224,yeah but those are token gated governance right
371225,nan
371226,euler labs working on something that will open a lot more possibilities like tetras old pool and developing a new oracle but yer i think this case showed euler working as intended just unfortunate that the oracle rating tools werent being used as actively as one would hope
371227,its the usual question of why even do long tail
371228,add 1000x risk make 10 dollars revenue
371229,is cool as a tool tho for sure just arguing
371230,idk i feel it makes sense for markets that just rely on economic activity rather than having biases towards them permissionless vs governance gated
371231,the euler model works while fuse doesnt work on its own due to governance gating on less sophisticated players
371232,the ctx guy posted in euler discord
371234,nan
371235,also wasnt euler working on daos to add pol on univ3 to harden the uni oracles or was that wonderland
371236,it was them yes cool idea
371237,i should point out that longtail isnt eulers target market it was more a design philosophy about building secure permissionless systems other protocols especially compound rely on the devsgovernance knowing which markets can be safely activated or not if they dont study the tokens properly then bad things happen hence why a majority of compound forks are now rekt the reentrant tokens always found a way to confound the devs in charge our thinking was that if you build a protocol designed to handle longtail exotic assets by default then you dont need devs who know the insandouts in charge of listing if you assume that tokens will be listed that are hostile or that have weird balanceof functions and reentrancy and fee on transfer and so on then it increases composability of the protocol and security overall that was the philosophy
371238,
371241,henlo admin why is lobster dao missing from this list
371243,enorme
371244,
371246,guys what do you think will happen with aave borrowed positions after ethereum 20 will be live i dont know do i should close my borrowed postitions due to bugs
371247,
371248,so oracles and uniswap also are safe
371249,technically yes from market volatility and related issues no
371250,ethpow quality logo and website runned by the best scammers in the business
371251,your post is actually showing that this scam is already succefull because 20k defi degens are discussing it herelets stop ethpow shill here plz
371252,shitty ass logo lmao
371253,
371254,very true very true
371255,recovering from a doubleoracle failurein the extreme and unlikely event that both oracles fail liquity uses the last good price seen for all operations effectively freezing the price used by the systemhowever liquity still does its best to recover and switch back to the primary oracle when it comes back online
371256,that of course assumes tellor doesnt keep working given their claim is decentralization shouldnt it
371257,depends if anyone wants to answer on ethpow to be paid tellorpow doubtful imo
371258,doubt any oracle project will actually support ethpow
371259,be paid what
371260,
371261,nahhhhh
371262,best address visualization tool to see where funds were deposit from where they went to then visualizating these transfers as well
371263,
371266,how can centralized entities enforce that is there any threat of retroactive sanctions for users who previously interacted with it
371267,if im not completely mistaken you pay reporters in trb but nobody will actually listen on ethpow to be paid the forked version of trb which will have no value at all
371268,lol privacy is illegal
371269,moronity is outstanding
371270,privacy is never a thing maybe hybird privacy
371271,monero solves this
371272,by automatically sending you to jail
371273,if it wasnt why are they sanctioning it
371274,lol not anymore
371275,i suppose thats a nice roundabout way of saying the 3las werent the ones running the tcash relayers
371276,like we shit post when we are bored government sanctions when they have nothing to do
371277,i wish gifs were allowed here
371278,nan
371279,the only reason they could do this is because tornado cash was optional unlike monero
371285,nobody is going to jail for using an entire network thats private by design
371287,well honestly this was kind of expected
371288,soooo whats stopping tornado cash from implementing tornado cash v2 now
371289,but tornado is some contract that you can choose to not use if they attempted the same thing on monero theyd need to sanction the entire network which is about as likely as sanctioning tor
371290,is monero really anonymous though with chainalysis prop soft
371291,this is what compromises for the mass adoption fetish looks like
371292,it is but that doesnt mean you cant rekt yourself using it
371293,did they sanction the website or the actual mixing contract
371294,actual contracts are all there
371295,all of the contracts
371296,so if you used tornado you are going to jail what does this mean for someone who used tornado to create fresh wallets instead of a cex
371297,gonna be fun to see what the fiatcoins do to the fiatcoins deposited in there
371298,remember the people claiming pools save you
371299,idk it doesnt make sense to apply this retroactively but what do i know
371300,its not retroactive only going forward
371301,tornado cash new wallet buy nft from old wallet fresh monies
371302,u r definitely going to jail
371303,we are all going to jail
371304,jail farming
371305,
371306,anonymity pool size and being on the bad side of this race it takes time to get on the sdn initially but updating it is likely much faster also technically v2 is out since dec19 so we would be waiting for v3 based on some new tech which somehow isnt based on known addresses which is tricky to say the least
371307,vote and decide which jail gets better dinners
371309,wen jail token
371310,vote on who gets rapedshanked
371311,they need apple strategy a new v version every year but its always the same product
371312,yo wtf
371313,dont drop the soap
371314,dao decentralized ass operation
371315,and im pretty sure theyll be going to jail if they same team announced such a thing theyre all generously public people on twitter
371316,what happens to forks
371317,shouldve announced a criminalizing mining program instead of a liquidity mining program with the torn launch lol spam random addresses with random amounts of dirty crypto in perpetuity
371319,nah this is not how it works at least not technically in practice governments can find a way how you broke the law i guess if they try hard enough but developing something which allows badthingstm is in the us considered free speech somehow most often using badthingstm when they are explicitly listed on sdns are on the other hand illegal for sure
371320,wait a second couldnt someone technically make a contract that mixes like 001 eth in tornado cash or something and then send it to like 10k addresses based on parameters that are like if acc balance 100k usd and basically fuck over people on purpose by making them go on the sanctions list lol
371321,this would be pretty easy to argue because of the mass scale targeted transfer to someones address could be deadly though
371322,well v3 of explicitly bad thing is still bad thing no they can pretend to be different people forking but few people will trust it out of the gate especially given the risk it could be our favorite 3las launching a honeypot
371323,yeah the idea is if everyone is sanctioned then the criteria for sanctioning becomes useless
371324,not just that but wouldnt this mean if you can trick someone into accepting mixed funds you would render their wallet address illegal
371325,something telling me us just opened pandoras box if they want to actively enforce this
371326,thats the point yes and wallets cant reject funds
371327,if the risk was making the entire network sanctioned people would take their privacy more seriously lol
371328,how long until is illegal too lol
371329,hi does anyone know of a chaosmonkey type system for erc20something that just tries to launch a bunch of bs and break itdoes such a thing exist
371330,
371331,us sanctions virtual currency mixer tornado cash wsjus treasury tornado cash used to launder 7b since 2019 wsjus tornado cash was used to launder north korea cybercrime funds wsj
371332,us the internet was used for cybercrime communications by north korea
371333,so if i sent 01eth to celebrity wallet they get banned from us
371334,bantg retweeted __going thru the list of sanctioned addys includes tc donate address proxy address gitcoin grants address tc router the usdc 100 pool 100 dai pool 10 eth pool 100 eth pool 1000 dai pool appears to be every tcrelated wallet they could find
371335,
371336,must be shitty to be a us citizen lol
371337,brave new world be like
371338,brave new world sucks
371339,ofac doesnt just apply to us in reality every single major financial institution has us entities this effectively blocks every tornado wallet from engaging or touching any tradfi entity
371340,brave new world in 1984
371341,but consumers are not us entities unless theyre us citizens or permanent residents ofc
371342,pretty sure that financial institutions have always steered clear of tornado
371343,i wonder if this moves the privacy narrative to forefront of crypto consciousness and keeps it there for longer than a week
371344,we live in a society
371345,i hope so
371346,stablecoins next imo this could be an interesting time to short pegs on stables
371347,at least something meaningful compared to scams and jpegs
371348,so far weve seen pockets of communities which are super privacy focused but by and large most degens dont care
371350,the 1 are always the loudest in general noone cares about privacy if theyre making money by being doxxed in generall people care only one its too late web2 is a prime example
371351,as an industry we should care about privacy it should be a priority it matters
371352,100 agreed alex i got into crypto because of the privacy aspect then chainalysis came around and we all realized btc wasnt as private as we thoughthoped
371353,industry acts in the interests of money if privacy adds friction or decreases profits generally it will be eroded
371354,but yes money privacy for now i guess
371355,we should care about both privacy and preventingmaking it hard to do illegal stuff this would also help the ecosystem by forcing hackers do go the extra mile
371356,is this a bull case for monero
371357,redacted shameless implicit plug
371358,wen delete fiatcoins from tornado
371359,anyone tracking the freezing
371360,its not easy in practice realistically how to do both from regulatory perspective
371361,privacy seems like an all or nothing proposition
371362,its binary you have it or you dont
371363,it is
371364,imo you create a permissioned pool contract and you hit the ball to the regulator to solve the unpermissioned by ofac or similar designations its a handsoff approach and sort of an asscovering exercise aave have done this imo with arc these permissioned pools are not really profitable until regulators act as noone cares until they have to care
371365,thats nonsensical if its permissioned theres no privacy
371366,without naming specifics there are many zero knowledge tools available to validate amlkyc in an anonymous way i just dont think there are any on mainnet as of yet and if there are theyre not widely adopted for obvious reasons because noone has had to care yetim not giong to comment on it anymore tbh as im too close to this as it will look like selfpromo which is lame
371367,anonymous kyc is an oxymoron
371368,hope people care now once we lose freedoms we dont get them back better to adopt now and have the industry move in that directionwhatever it means
371369,when it comes to privacy everything anything nothing
371370,ok you drew me outimagine you get entry into a nightclub and they ask you to get validate your id you go and scan your id into a machine the machine checks your id and assures you havent been in any bar fights the bouncer then stamps your hand you have a stamp on your hand you can access the club no bouncer or anyone in the nightclub knows you the machine company dont store your info or know what club you are currently in or why you wanted to check even if the machine does store your info it doesnt matter because they have your data anyway from the very fact you have an id card the key part is that they dont know any more information which can be enforced by zkthats anonymous kycaml and its extremely important to make sure its done so no subpeonas can doxx users wallets
371371,u implicitly have to trust the machine doesnt store a copy
371372,
371373,and what about all the usdc backing dai used in tornado contracts
371374,there is a 50 block rule afaik like you need to block assets of something if they originate for 50 from sanctioned sources wouldnt rule it out that they have to freeze those funds has there been precedent for them doing that for other sanctioned addresses
371375,i just wanna go to jail alreadyi never used tornado evenbut its all so tiring ahhhhjust let me die in peace its too exhausting
371377,pretty certain that has zilch to do with the sanction
371378,hey everyone just saw about the tornado news does that mean we should stop using any wallet that had previously interacted w tornado
371379,this is just use cexs instead of tornadocash
371381,
371382,roman is a dangerous north korean hacker
371384,unless through p2p in regions where its already popular you cant cash out your crypto thats in tornado rn without some legal backing right
371385,not with size i think in general this blacklisting does not change much in terms of cashing out the offramps have been flagging tornado transactions for a while already
371386,theres 71k usdc in one and 3900 in another
371387,circle will probably freeze them once they get around to it
371388,lol i thought other channels dont pr here
371389,and
371390,so far not
371391,if youre one of the 71 people who deposited 1k usdc to tornado and hasnt withdrawn yet its still possible
371392,dprk statesponsorednot enough they should throw in childtrafficking and election interference that should get more emotions flowing lol
371394,pyramidshape made out of partial eth logos wonder how thatll go
371395,cant we just use dai usdc wrapper atm over tornadoaztec its much harder for them to blacklist given the fall outedit ah river0x asked first
371396,maybe theres something deeper going on sanctioning is a deeply political move its never just about the money laundering or whatever
371397,this and the people thatll be goaded into building infra for it to continue will be used as scape goat
371398,yes
371399,ser russia just doesnt have the same oomph anymore
371400,
371401,sorry ofac i need more than address to enforce i need bis dpl entry as well
371402,cloudflare 1111 dns has tos stating they do not do broad enforcement actions and require specifics why not same with rpc
371403,when etherscan dmca takedown notice for non attribution of scrapped dataset
371404,any lawyers here
371405,ofac exemption clearing for funds sounds fun someone should do that and report back in a few years how it went
371406,ephemeral cash every depositwithdrawal forwards the remaining balance to a newlygenerated contract and selfdestructs the previous one
371407,
371408,only couch lawyers
371409,this should be the right take including for non us residents just google meng wanzhou iran sanction
371416,this tornado cash sanction is forward looking right ie retroactive to august 22 should be fine just rip to those who have deposits there
371417,the part where you assume this has anything to do with the sanction
371418,this couldnt be more irrelevant in the matter
371419,nobody cares
371420,hey sam can u look at dm pls related to securerpc
371422,glad to meet an officer here 3
371424,here breadcrumbsapp
371425,ethtectivecom and mirrorxyzofficerciaethbfzv17uwh6qg4q711naljtsip8ekr17daljtdmagbhw
371432,kinda sus if true but also idk if true is weird af anywaaaayps please do personal things not here in lobsters at least then
371434,ur comments above are totally complete btw no worries and the forum link too i saw references
371435,someone just created a fake sudoswap governance token xsudo token the scammer minted the tokens to 0xmons public wallet and made it look like he was airdropping them dont fall for it its a honeypot
371436,aye can confirm no sudo yet
371438,how annoying that your wallet now shows 10 sites of transactions which you didnt do on etherscan
371440,responded ser
371441,what did i do also when did i ever interact with you in the past especially in an accusatory wayroman already responded about this in the twitter thread i had no idea about that individual nor his tg group i see things changed and he is no longer involved with tornado which is goodbut perhaps you can dm me to not spam lobsters for any clarifications
371442,can you speak more into this is it true that etherscan ties searched addresses to ip addresses
371443,if you deposit dirty crypto into a crosschain bridge is all the money in it rekt
371444,what about using this with this
371445,
371446,wait what bad stablecoin design was absolutely a major if not primary factor in the terra collapse
371457,redacted dont flood in here
371458,
371459,well aside from not existingone remaining challenge is figuring out how to pay fees the best i can come up with is if you send someone an erc721 also send along enough eth to pay fees 550 times to send it further if you get an erc721 without enough eth then you can tornado some eth in
371460,agreed but i think the point theyre making is that magic internet coins arent sound collateral in general which is an odd take from someone working at a16z crypto
371461,naisu fiatcoins to the rescue
371462,your money is now our money
371463,to be fair not having collateral is pretty similar to having bad collateral and its not like financial times can be expected to know anything about finance
371464,yeah i just read the article much more reasonable than the tweet would suggest
371465,god forbid someone doesnt buy into the western narrative
371466,lol
371467,why algorithmic stablecoins they said
371468,the writer is general counsel and head of decentralisation at venture capital fund a16z crypto part of andreessen horowitz
371469,wouldve been pretty interesting if tornado depended on some chainlink thing
371470,not existing yet yes as for paying fees yea it wouldnt work if you did not have eth in your wallet already
371471,easy answer was to pump vcs bank accounts
371472,no more than the litany of other vc funded projects in this space
371473,yeah the article itself was pretty decent how did that tweet turned out so bad
371474,at least those dont claim to be stable
371475,so what does the vc aspect have to do with that
371476,floody
371477,please finish the point
371478,not having collateral is pretty similar to having bad collateral is a beautiful statement and should be the response to every algostable pitch ever
371479,shopping spree
371480,when storytelling meets reality
371481,thats pretty wildly disingenuous
371482,its in his best interest to lie have a nuanced discussion about it
371483,nan
371484,a more readable version of this
371485,seems like theyre blacklisting a bunch of tornado cashs wallets
371486,if a fight happens in a forest and no one is around to spectate does it happen
371487,any wallet that has directly interacted with tornado cash or any wallet that is in a tree of wallets having interacted with tornado cash
371488,group is super active today
371489,
371490,
371491,nan
371492,tornado cash website not working anymorei am not in us btw
371493,still not working for me
371494,its down
371495,inb4 market days announcing seizure by fbi etc
371496,curious where they hosted website dont think njal as it wouldnt have went down that fast
371497,
371498,
371499,
371500,
371501,so these are just us addresses or based on what is this list put together
371502,tornado github is down also
371503,people that think and thought pooling will save them from the risks of a fiatcoin are in for a rude awakening
371504,and apparently people who forked the repo too lol
371505,
371506,ppl that forked the code had they github suspended too
371507,what are some good youtube channel for basic crypto fundamentals for completely new person
371508,i stand corrected thought id seen a report of that i dont think so
371511,
371512,
371513,better to convert usdt
371514,i dont know what people were expecting
371515,yup
371516,no these are tornado pools each having multiple users who are not necessarily us persons
371517,
371518,ahh no individual user wallets
371519,thanks for the reply
371520,
371521,anyone salt mining neat little trick to find efficient contract addresses cheaper gas for calldata to deploy to
371522,converted all my usdc to dai in case
371523,lol
371524,dai is almost entirely usdc
371525,any torn relayer addresses affected
371526,lmao
371527,converted all my dai to rai just in case
371528,id check but i am in remote jungle with shit wifi
371529,now thats how u do it
371531,damn its already blacklisted
371532,youre blacklisted what is blacklisted
371533,its a meme
371534,memes go in the lobster kingdom
371535,tornado was added to a sanctions list todayish i think
371536,lusd
371538,not helpful fud ser
371540,
371541,tornado flirting with regulations in april didnt pay of
371542,if lazaruz can wash millions worth dollars thru your dapp there is no way of a settlement
371544,also down now
371545,
371546,also this still works
371547,is cloudflare going to flirt with sanctions insert doubt meme
371548,i mean microsoft owns github so not surprising they would follow us sanctions list
371549,limo
371550,limo is down now ser
371551,a oh pardon
371552,although the big gateways may well block if you run an ipfs node locally you should always be able to still access this stuff thats kind of the point of ipfs
371553,no
371554,no one who forked their codebase is suspended
371555,additionally their is a wallet block wallet that implemented tornado cash natively
371556,still available on google chrome
371557,native to what
371558,out of interest can cl be forced to upgrade the contract to remove tcs usage of their oracle service
371559,native to the browser
371560,who cares about cl tornado cash has a backup gas oracle anyway
371561,who maintains that
371562,peppersec auditing firm
371563,tornado cash alternatives
371564,the urls you mean
371565,no different code
371566,dont know any trustable tornado alternative personally
371567,but using tornado with eth should never be a problem correct me if im wrong
371568,
371569,the amms would be just fine lol
371570,its useful if you want to see how much merit there is to certain storytelling
371571,the worlds shortest fight for example
371572,
371573,
371574,zkmoney
371575,would expect that cls hand is being forced similarly to how circles was forced would be weird not to or
371576,watch the multisig then
371578,if uniswap is looking for what to do with the apparently too much money they have on hand they can try with zkmoney before they have a chance to blacklist it too high likelihood of that being far more useful than ahem gifting eduwhatchamacallit funds free money
371579,
371582,ethlimo is a decentralized alternative to cloudflares for delivering ensipfs content your privacy focused gateway
371583,pinning service problems probably
371584,can you quickly query how many total addys are blacklisted
371585,funnily still works
371586,fucking idiot usg how am i now suppose to know ahead of time when a protocol is about to get hacked
371587,balance 100 and balance 1000 ie 39 71
371588,cloudflare may fight a takedown
371589,at least they have a history of doing so
371590,the people at the top are trying to take privacy away from the people but they are unconsciously forcing devs to create technologies that circumvent their surveillance
371591,lol pretty ironic
371593,
371594,run tornado in local
371599,
371601,i think everyone is panicking for no reason tbh doubt anything comes of this some deleted github accounts the world is ending
371603,ethlimo isnt as decentralized as people thought
371604,i agree and disagree they chose sanctions to kill off a defi project low blow you cant fight that but imho they didnt do it because privacy bad its only for hackers etc they had a political reason that we could soon discover
371605,because limo is just an official gtld under icann
371606,you created something you knew would be used for crime and surprised they did something shocked
371607,bad take wed all be using tornado if we didnt have cexs as mixers
371608,bad is being generous dumb is more accurate
371609,but we do and always have
371610,trying to kill torn isnt a good thing and i look forward to seeing them pull through
371612,all products can be used for crime dummy
371613,if there was an eth with privacy at a protocol layer id rather use that one
371614,tools are inherently nuetral objects and torn provided a useful service all this has accomplished is making cooperation less likely between defi and the usg not good for the usg longrun
371615,incinerate all free oxygen on earth criminals breathe that only good people should be allowed access to air imagine all the bad people we can get rid off if we controlled access to oxygen
371616,no tools are certainly not neutral
371617,tools are what people use them for you can use a hammer to build a house or you can use it to crack a mans skull
371618,
371619,wait until daos get hit with rico cases
371620,you think sanctions are bad
371621,nietzsche nihilismthis is one of my pet peeves nietzsche wasnt a nihilist
371622,anyways a youtube link to an outgrowth of phenomonological thinking isnt an argumentespecially not when youre asking me to spent an hour and a half on it
371623,legislators do not believe tools are neutral and thats all that matters really just check the long list of regulatedbanned tools
371624,the catholic church didnt think that all books such as die 95 thesen were neutral either and look how that worked out with the printing press
371625,clickbait title going to clickbait
371626,not following
371627,now your denzinger too
371628,the 95 theses were written by martin luther
371629,luther was a heretic tho
371630,i know
371631,im making a reference to denzinger as your offering a bit of exegesis on catholic dogma
371632,whats denzinger
371633,jordan peterson of prussia but with a catholic tint
371634,i know but not sure how this invalidates what i said
371635,that as the group driving the disruptive tech we should be forming our own opinions rather than referencing the dogma of the legacy system as it is our system that is replacing theirs you dont measure technology that creates a new paradigm with the same set of rulers you used to measure the old paradigm its nonsensical
371636,mmmmm
371637,maybe you will find it useful lobsters
371638,im not making a commentary on the catholic church more their reaction to the invention of the printing press and how trying to suppress new tech doesnt work the arabic world banned it and that arguably contributed to the islamic golden age coming to a close
371639,wut
371640,my guy
371641,trying to bancontrol technology that changes the paradigm doesnt work and you can see that pattern repeat throughout history things flow where incentives align
371642,the catholic church tried to ban certain books after the printing press made creating them easy but printers discovered that printing those books made them more money so such books proliferated rapidly
371646,
371647,printing press success is a transfer of wealth from feudal power centers to new mercantile power centers
371648,my thesis is that central banking systems trying to exert similar controls on decentralized finance are going to encounter similar setbacks to what the catholic church did in trying to slow the proliferation of banned books
371649,whos the eistenzgruppen of the cbs then
371650,anything that gives you a game theoretic advantage will undoubtedly be used and leveraged to the favor of the user yes
371651,ie averorrism is a dead end
371652,are you sure it didnt work out last time i checked catholic church is in decline while islam is up only
371653,philosophy wise yea its dead
371654,blame birth control and the land o lakes declaration for the decline of holy mother church
371655,obv fake but funny
371658,shouldnt have used tornado cash for his golf club
371659,its unclear the reason behind the raid but notably trump said that federal agents even broke into my safetrump accused the raid of being politically motivated blasting it as prosecutorial misconduct and the weaponization of the justice system
371661,usg is on a roll today
371662,cant believe he used tornado cash too chad
371663,still usg acting
371664,nk withdraw directly into lido merge canceled
371666,found this weird account that seems to be doing arbs mev but its coming from an eoa is this still a bot wired up to an eoa or is it something else
371667,sers please no politics no religion
371668,bot eoa
371672,if a nonus friend used tornado cash recently should he be worried about his addresses that hold usdc
371673,yes
371674,usdc is controlled by a us based entity
371675,well this might offer an overview of all the implications of interacting with tornado cash disregard the sensationalist tone
371678,muh pristine collateral
371679,and growth is more important than becoming increasingly centralized for this one
371680,wen immutable fiatcoin wrapper that drops the pretend game
371683,
371685,
371686,any hasacontract project working on privacy should definitely be thinking about something of the sort one certainly should unless they fancy rebranding to acexnetwork in order to comply or being next in the press release lol
371687,wouldnt aztec hold all data relating to who has requested what transfers and likely be required to release logs to the authorities if subpoenaed anyway
371688,if the answer to that is yes then that is going to be a very fun conversation for anyone involved with the project
371689,reading up on it now thanks i dont yet see how this doesnt get stored onchain at some point unless it was p2p encryption with privately shared keys but they explicitly call that out as not what theyre doing
371690,so from what im reading all transactions within aztec are encrypted but not the initial deposit which is conducted via smart contract i assume they likely store all transactions internally i cant find any privacy policy or documentation that outlines this though
371691,
371694,so euler works like kashi
371695,
371696,tornado team send 270k torn to binance after saction
371697,seems soft rug
371698,what are some examples of projects with good token design that encourageslongterm activecommunity participation
371699,there are about 5 different things mixed in this question you wont get any good or reasonable answer
371700,how do i cure all diseases while flying on a unicorn identify the problem first
371701,is there an easy and fast way to check if i ever interacted with tornado cash contracts
371702,re what are some examples of projects with good token design
371704,cryptoaml_bot investigation regime breadcrumbsapp or ethtectivecom
371705,a good project and strong team in a predictable and transparent roadmap planned and projectedpls ivan dont banupd i suppose ur question is philosophical
371706,what is good pump price good governance distribution aligned incentives sorry for being a nagger but again you are not actually aware of what you are askingvecrv is like perpetually selling more inflation and i wouldnt say there is some alignment per se token holders are almost aligned to vote for the semishitty stables as they bring more revenue always the case with shareholders tho in normal companies toovecrv used to get a palp during announcement as it forces a lot to lock but there did not pass enough time to judge longterm effects and pump good probablythen there is the old maker burn from excess revenue model a bit trivial and full but kinda works however in periods of expansion you actually need inflation incentives or others take over so you need adaptive mechanisms different products different approach
371707,also good for whom seed investors retail investors team ecosystem underlying blockchain different stakeholders have different goals and objectives
371708,i think ether has pretty decent design after merge i would look for utility and realworld need and use vs inflatory emissions competitive advantage and how easy it is to defend it value accruel tvl user growth game theory mechanics such as locking etc decentralisation and dao mechanics governance stakeholders and their objectives and alignment security audits hacks forks etc
371710,very interesting seri just wanted to read more on projects that are aligning incentives well more importantly incentives towards longterm community participation and growth through rewards for sustainable liquidity growth my question came up thru this talk on gauntlet network on quantitative protocol management
371711,samczsun you keep those contact details private right
371712,yes
371713,the whole point is a more rapid method of communication people might not want to put in a securitytxt or onchain
371714,noob q wheres the best place to look at liq over time inside a particular liq poole currently using infouniswap
371715,you can use bitquery and graph for getting historical liquidity
371716,defillama
371717,they need very good lawyers are you really in a position to judge here
371718,this those guys are gonna be in a world of hurt for a decent while
371719,please listen to this
371720,questionable move i could imagine binance messing with that transfer just to be safe they are not in good spot with us regulators at the moment
371721,
371722,anyone can share
371723,literally about to post that yes very good watch
371724,could anyone enlighten me or provide me material on what happens technically when theres a nft reveal is the metadata updated onchain how would one go about doing nft mutations or evolutions
371726,join nft_avenue to not spam lobs with nft research but basically the tokenuri or baseuri is updated somehow and some contracts can have additional logic or a method to alter the tokenuri
371727,that may be good for certain types of token holders but if you are part of that strong team giving a transparent roadmap planned and projected and said projection doesnt end a few weeks after launch consider whether you are going to get new friends
371728,
371729,seems overblown at least for now
371730,they just disabled the api keys for the tornado cash project
371731,as a user u cant send a tx wdym
371732,ie theyre not scanning rpc request contents yet
371733,crypto needs dentralized rpc services
371734,there is pokt and smth else i heard
371735,just host the front end on your own and create a new infura project and put the key in instead of the disabled one
371736,w us vcs or its irrelevant
371737,or use your own rpc
371738,i mean it sucks obviously but it doesnt seem to be what the tweet indicated which is that infura is blocking any call that interacts with the sanctioned addresses
371739,it seem more adoption of decentralised prc needed
371740,which may be coming soon ofc
371741,i dont think is relevant if its not all run by us nodes
371742,dont get rekt
371743,just in metamaskhas partnered withasset reality an endtoend solution for recovering seized crypto assetswatcherguru
371744,asset reality is the worlds first endtoend solution for complex assets its platform provides services and tools to public and private sector companies investigating managing and recovering assetsfrom helping crypto companies support victims of fraud to enabling governments to manage and realise portfolios of seized assets its mission is to improve asset recovery for victims and society
371745,how do they know metamask consensys generously helps them make such a determination but never fear this only affects bad people
371746,tfw infura and alchemy send your address interacting with tornado straight to these guys and the powers that be pay you an explosive visit this isnt like your usual sec storytelling
371747,so apart of rabby what other good browser based not mobile apps alternatives we have
371748,framesh is great
371749,need some guidance guys if i have some torn locked in tornado cash for staking what do i have to do to get it out
371750,frame is the best advanced user wallet
371751,forfeit the usg is the captain now
371752,wouldnt the ipfs link work
371753,infura and alchemy rpcs refuse to interact with tornado
371754,dont use alchemy or infura
371755,unless you like the idea of donning an orange jumpsuit in order to make a statement then by all means go interact with tornado
371756,eg pokt or flashbots protect
371757,not legal advice obviously i dont even know how i got in this group was added by third party yadda yadda
371758,can also run your own node ofc
371759,hi guys how liquidations on aave works i heard that they are not immediately but when someone will make liquidationcall but how it works technically
371760,i dont know but you best be pretty certain about your security if youre attempting this if youre using metamask in its default settings andor have paid for alchemy then you are almost certainly not
371761,consider apple and friends will gladly gift your information over if and when the connections are made
371762,
371763,da
371765,these prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds goods or services by to or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds goods or services from any such person
371766,in a roundabout way tcash crypto is now a very good way to test just how decentralized anything is send to bridge and watch
371767,quick question has there been any developmentsimprovements to dags which are worth looking into a bit more i recall that there were issues around centralisation either coordinatorswitness nodes and that was the reason that they never really took off im wondering if there have been any technological developments that are worth looking into or they just fundamentally dont work
371768,i guess fantom is the most prominentwidely used dag at the moment sorry if this has already been discussed not worth talking about
371769,time to switch to pocket
371770,a bit of a stretch friendo
371771,plus im sure burgerland feds have right now something else in hands that people that bought eloncumcoins with tainted eth
371772,but fear always works or so the chilling effect people normally think
371773,you wouldnt download a car you wouldnt use privacy tools
371774,download that mp3 song and they will raid you in 2 weeks
371775,made a dune board of addresses in violation of the ofac sanctions
371776,im sure there is jail and big fines for not declaring your crypto taxes etc yet you have irs burning dozens of millions of documents because they are incompetents you have to meet reality with their fear propaganda and of course protect yourself and have a correct opsec meanwhile because you never know but if we cared about the system saying we cant do things why would be here
371777,have u heard about our lord savior
371778,munero
371779,sers what is currently common considering wisdom as best investment option for 1 whole ethereum
371780,not really
371781,its not a bear market until people starting to talk about privacy again
371782,so the bear market officialy started now
371783,i know 3 dag based chains fantom hedera iotain the end u can see that dags are something what people dont care about
371784,sui aptos
371785,narwhal bullshark are ground breaking consensus and me looks worth looking at
371786,avalanche is also a dag iirc
371787,awesome thanks samueldare will take a look
371788,senpai i dont think you want to test that unless you fancy your odds of being bernstein 20
371789,nobody ever sanctioned a pirate site or vpn
371790,its too difficult to enforcepirate websites just provide links to torrent files or magnetsvpns can just use a different server
371791,tornado just provided a tool too
371792,this might be a dumb question but why didnt they go after tornado on other networks or did i miss that
371793,north korea are ethereum maxis
371794,makes sense
371795,also dont know how insinuating it was so easy to enforce against tornado that they deemed a sanction worth it helps
371796,i think the most damming part of the sanctions is that they seem to be going after devsnot sure how many people think decentralisation is worth going to jail for
371797,how did nk cash out previously with tornadoed ethusd not like they can sell on coinbase and wire to a nk bank lol
371798,ser clean eth is money
371799,sometimes they even make their own non kyc p2p platforms and just wash funds using users and getting clean transactions to multiple bank cards
371800,if you have a rouge state behind you you can do pretty much anything that comes to mind to launder money
371801,
371802,
371803,
371804,
371805,afaik fantom is coming with some updates both to their dag and the abft consensus mechanism some bits about that already out on their roadmap
371806,
371807,so how do i run a light node and my own rpc i dont have terabytes of disk space
371808,did u have an answer
371809,breadcrumbs
371810,hey guys does anybody knows an rpc provider that will give ethpow services
371813,fear yes and for good reason propaganda well martyrs will certainly be needed so ganbare the last guy didnt last very long
371814,he was not simply sentenced for a north korea trip the guy discussed in detail and in writing on how nk can use crypto tech to further their agenda if i recall right he also did it in the most blatant and stupid way possible because he thought on an ideological level that the sanctions against nk were unjustbasically he asked for it hard
371815,basically reality met storytelling and storytelling lost in the most unambiguous way possible
371816,he also talked to the fbi like they were his best friend
371817,here is a good summary of it imho
371818,when eth forks steth holders wont be a part of the snapshot right
371819,not with their eth but they will have worthless steth on the forked chain
371820,its all fun and games memeing the world police with random usernames on the internet inflating your ego until the bottom falls out and you realize well the world police has a reputation for a reason
371822,will the snapshot be on the last pow block
371823,no idea depends on whatever the people who fork it decide on theres no information yet its not even 100 confirmed it will happen at all also id not waste to much energy on trying to capture this its gonna be a massive insider scam
371824,so was bch
371826,someone just tagged vitaliks not buterin wallet with tornadod eth
371829,already uses it himself granted that was prior to the ban hammer
371830,surprised he hasnt said anything about it yet lol
371831,looks liek the current tornado withdrawer is going down the debank leader board
371832,link
371833,thats only debank id everyone can mint a name
371834,
371835,look for the 008 values they are the targets
371836,the github saga just gets better and better
371837,have you already seen this web3 widget super cool feature for defi dapp developers
371838,lol another intern
371839,so you cant discuss blockchain technology from an ideological standpoint how can you not defend virgil
371840,if theyre looking for a more interesting outcome than crypto forgetting about this like every other thing then there are at least a half dozen contracts they can send those radioactive eth to
371841,theyre already dealing with him
371842,he explained
371843,he did not just discuss blockchain technology he literally talked about utilizing it in specific ways that would help nk to further the kind of behavior they have been sanctioned for check the yt video i linked earlier its a good summary the guy wasnt some sort of heroyou can argue about whether the deserved the 5 years but expecting the state to act in any other way than it did in this case is detached from reality
371844,some people always try to make it look like he just went to nk for some generic talk on ethereum but thats not what happened
371845,the specific way was to avoid uswestern sanctions
371846,i dont see anything wrong with that
371847,its presumably this guy who just did a ton of 01 eth deposits
371848,which was funded from from a single 100 eth withdraw and the trail ends there
371849,maybe dont go to nk to meet with governmental officials in general
371850,next theyll ban eth because russiaputin bad
371851,they did not ban anything they just put someone behind bars who blatantly disregarded the laws they put in place collaborating with the north korean government is hardly a noble cause
371852,nothing wrong with that just dont expect to be able to live free in the us afterwards
371853,ideologically how can you not support virgil regardless of your thoughts on nk or any state deemed evil by the western world
371854,troll troll troll
371855,and next theyll ban lobster dao because lobsters def a slippery slope
371856,i do not support him because he chose to collaborate with a government which is even if you are very generous way worse than the ones which put the sanctions in place
371857,bullish for solana iykyk
371858,he had the choice to basically pick from a number of causes that could have helped people but he choose the north korean government to support
371859,
371860,need to add tornado ban to this
371861,nk is a great example of sanctions not working at all rather than parroting usg propaganda and saying shit like it is what it is ask yourself if they have achieved any desired outcomes
371862,you could argue ideologically he is against western sanctions which affect russia cuba venezuela nk china etc arabmiddle east and many more to come
371863,looks like he earmarked 35 eth for this
371864,yeah debank traders are fun but im just waiting for cdixoneth or falloneth lmao to get tainted
371865,i do not care what he is for or against he collaborated with an ultra repressive authoritarian governmentrejecting western governments because they are overreaching and pushing too much regulation while somehow arguing that its okay to collaborate with the north korean government is extreme cognitive dissonance
371866,cough send to lido staking contract cough
371867,mmm i has to be a us person right
371868,many americans using lido
371869,im sure the lido staking contract already has a lot of tornadoed eth
371870,prior to the sanction sure
371871,ceo of ava labs avax won a defamation case yesterday against some influuuuuencer who called him a terrorist
371872,the game changed in the last 24 hours
371873,it is impossible to prove any crypto coming out isnt from the dreaded dprk statesponsored hacking group so by association all the eth crypto coming out is radioactive
371874,so the way to solve this is to support the north korean government
371875,unless they do something with actual consequences the market is probably going to forget about this in 2 weeks
371876,it works with zk proofs and pooled assets once you want to make a transaction with your funds in that pool you prove to the contract that you own x amounts of token a and thus are allowed to do sth with x amounts of token a in that pool the smart contract then takes a tokens from the pool and does something with them no one including the smart contract or aztec knows can see who did the transaction
371877,coine_r
371878,hello does anyone have 200k testnet matic on mumbai
371879,time for that nuanced discussion
371880,fud read more
371881,does restricted movement mean all usdc in those addresses are now fully frozen or are they blacklisted from receiving
371883,both
371884,this is too big but let me see how we can help
371885,were launching incentivized testnet on polygon today at tokensoft
371886,he doesnt have much of a choice basically nobody has successfully fought off an ofac inclusion and these guys dont fuck around with enforcing it id just treat it as a useful wake up call that theres a reason why we dont want the leading stable issuer to be a centralized american company tbf tether would probably comply too
371887,sure but thats not helpful fud he said
371888,so is this tornado situation really bad for those who used it
371889,is there software to check if wallet interacted with it
371890,i assume that was before he got a memo from legal
371891,it wouldnt be that much of a problem if he didnt lie have a nuanced discussion about it
371892,i got to imagine if you used it in the past then youre fine that would be the equivalent of banning alcohol and then prosecuting everyone who drank while it was legal
371893,as for tether yeah pretty sure its gonna get blacklisted and deleted
371894,i actually remember using it only once just to check how shit works
371895,like few years ago
371896,the guy he replied to made it look like circle is just going to randomly freeze peoples assets without an external trigger while its true that they can do that in principle its of course not in their best interest thats what he wanted to communicate with his reply i think
371897,wbtc too though considering the design of their current contracts they will need to brick the current one
371898,dming you
371899,it may not be in their best interest but it is undeniably true
371900,to counter with not accurate not helpful fud is disingenuous at best
371901,yes banks exchanges use it to figure out how risky addresses are
371902,yes agreed but i can see where hes coming from does not seem malicious to me more a heat in the moment thing
371903,welp fallon has violates us sanctions
371904,the tweet he replied to was clearly meant to farm engagement not to have a rational discussion or actually inform people
371905,i mean any tool to check my own addys
371907,thats not true
371908,
371909,and it is far more malicious to insinuate any fiatcoin cannot at anytime for any reason whatsoever render your money useless
371910,it may be your keys but it most certainly isnt your coins
371911,hes the ceo of a fiatcoin that spends its time being marketed as a better tether he should know better
371912,in his tweet he literally linked an article that says that they can freeze funds the part he took issue with was clearly that the guy acted like they do it arbitrarily
371913,people pointed out this contradiction he didnt correct himself
371914,he posted the contradiction within the same tweet like thats what the link leads to
371915,thats what im saying
371916,this is no different from hedera lying about what was in their own whitepaper
371917,yes so it was most likely just a quick response on his part than some big maliicous attempt to lie to people you need to just get over people making mistakes sometimes
371918,actually its worse because at least hedera walked back their claims eventually
371919,i would give him the benefit of the doubt if there was any evidence this was a mistake
371920,and you can definitely argue that saying circle the issuer of usdc can freeze usdc in any address at any time for whatever reason without any further context creates a degree of fud
371921,the only people that will read this and see fud are the people trying to sell this fiatcoin as something it is not
371922,it is unambiguously true in every sense of the word and there are many people who seek to minimize the realities of using a fiatcoin by using more flowery language andor hiding the technical details at the bottom of needlessly wordy lawyerspeak that most people wont read which they know unsurprisingly the ceo of said fiatcoin is one of them
371923,yes but we promise blah blah blah 1000 words later we can but not in best interest blah blah blah
371924,there are many people who seek to minimize the realities of using algostables by using more flowery language andor hiding the technical details at the bottom of needlessly wordy lawyerspeak that most people wont read which they know
371925,why would an algostable need lawyerspeak
371926,you should certainly call out the algostables that do that if you find them though
371927,sorry i should have replaced lawyerspeak with hype or complicated diagrams
371928,wasnt disagreeing with you just been annoyed with algostables misrepresenting themselves and agreed with your comment wrt that
371929,some things are necessarily complicated so thats not a fault i would much rather have a million algostables than yet another fiatcoin or pretend fiatcoin wrapper
371930,
371931,nan
371932,if you want to make a fiatcoin wrapper at least dont lie about what it is like the top 2 today
371933,im arguing that people with traces of stained eth are irrelevant for the police and youre equating it with a guy personally giving instructions to north korea on how to evade sanctions
371934,im not saying opsec good practices respecting the law where you live at least in paper etc etc arent important things what im saying is that they like fear porn like 10 years ago bitcoin was to buy drugs and hire hitmen and if you bought bitcoin they would go after you and all the similar narratives dont use defi there is no kyc so we cant protect you from interacting with nk haxxorz
371935,traces of stained eth is different from choosing to use tornado after its been sanctioned
371937,theres no censorship like self censorship
371938,seems like algostables are still unsolved and that we need at least one legit fiatcoin wrapper
371939,maybe some palestinian wont care
371940,what is the impact of the tornado cash sanctions on stablecoins why should you care about decentralized stablecoins what are your options anon
371941,ymmv
371942,good enough for their purposes as for whether theyre irrelevant to the police thats your problem to worry about
371943,theres a huge difference between oh no what would the neighbour think if i use bitcoin and actual sanctions one you can ignore the other you cant
371944,agree like all the people that rugged thousands of coins and thousands of people
371945,make no mistake the only technical difference between today and yesterday is tornado is just about 2x harder to access but very much still possible so if youre feeling lucky by all means lol
371946,no i mean the actual narrative that i myself swallowed for years the police will investigate who is buying bitcoin because for what else would they buy it for consequences of not reading the whitepaper and nothing else but journalists
371947,and if youre trying to leave an impact there are many a contract to interact with but if and when you do get rekt dont be surprised
371948,yeah the code works othersame devs are free to copypaste with non sanctioned contracts they can even try to launder the sanctioned eth there
371949,what you are saying is simply that most of the things you can do are too small scale unimportant to get persecuted or even noticed however this does not mean that you can not get persecuted if you cross a line or are unlucky
371950,again that narrative was pushed without any sort of backing or even law behind it it was essentially media fluff and the equivalent to what would the neighbour think now there is actual weight behind it and a specific set of laws to back it up and enforce it its not the same context at all
371951,yeah that much i agree with
371952,so sure you could use it but now youll have a lot of pushback and increase unnecessary risks the likelihood of being affected frozen assets legal issues etc have significantly increased
371953,yeah 100 agree with your statement but what im also saying is that if someone usa in this case doesnt accept coins doesnt mean everyone has to dance around necessarily because maybe there will be people wanting to make a statement in the contrary as in you cant tell me what to code or not etc etc
371954,neither its the same pretending to substitute the financial system with a malfunctioning code that doesnt work and nobody develops in it than with the current state of things around crypto nowadays if you build a global non kyc system you cant stop it because you may interact with unbanked people or better said you should have known from the very beginning that it would happen
371955,its hard for an american mind to understand that there are countries outside us and there are real people living in them who have separate life and separate set of standards
371956,ive read dozens of projects wanting to put stocks from the american stock market in some dex how they are going to avoid selling american stocks to an iranian in none of their documents you will see ita dev developing such thing and unaware of the consequences sounds at best not a very good dev
371957,so now the addresses that received 01 eth has 10 days time to inform law enforcement about itblocked virtual currency must be reported to ofac within 10 business days and thereafter on an annual basis so long as the virtual currency remains blocked
371958,if you interact with people in sanctioned countries you will have problemsthe people in sanctioned countries
371959,geez its hard to discuss about uncertain regulations when we are not regulators ourselves
371960,is there anything uncertain about ofac id much rather have 10 sec pdfs than this lol
371964,i am gonna ban you alland not because u r americanschill out please on spam
371966,thats not what i was saying if youre an american entity youre expected to comply with american rules in this case whether the user is nonamerican or american at this point doesnt seem to really matter will you go to jail for trying to hide a small transaction probably no will your assets be frozen associated with that particular wallet probably yes
371967,sry
371968,protip buy a lobs and seek shelter in lobsterdao kingdom ivan can not hurt you there
371971,hypothetically speaking would be interesting to know if you have interacted with a sanctioned country if you unknowingly receive money from it from an intermediary say that you have a company which has a company client and said client gets investigated for nk money does it mean something to you even if part of that money was used to pay yougiven the nature of the wallets hard to argue before a judge that x y or z wallets in the middle of stained eth and the last wallet where they end were willingly helping the sanctioned country
371972,couch legal stops now all tornadoinspiredfakelawyers can piss off we talked about lusd rai dai sai mai fai kai lai the last few are fake obviously we talked about some consequences we talked about blacklisting we talked about forks of tornado for lulz and aztec not a fork ofc etc now this is the end we also talked about how truly decentralized concepts have harder time scaling etc stop repeating stuff in circles and use ctrlfuntil new stuff pops up every retarded message of a nonexpert will be a ban memes too for memes go to kingdomaka buy the shit nft and then u can spam more
371973,go ahead try kind sers
371974,any thoughts on the uniswap foundation vote
371975,isnt this just what uniswap the company does
371976,one of the benefits of a foundation for foss projects is that you can pay people to work on the project but uniswap already has that along with tons of contributors so i cant really see the benefit of having another entity
371977,it is a little confusing with the existence of uniswap labs the protocol ventures and uniswap grants
371978,read a few comments from here
371979,and no uniswap company does not do it
371980,guys wont the eth xmr atomic swaps solve the issue of the over reaction today there is already a working btc atomic swap and successful eth tesnet swaps
371981,atomic swaps are fine but there needs to be some way to determine the price of the swap since lping isnt an option
371982,kinda boring to sit on xmr with no smart contracts in sight
371983,swap in and out to a fresh new wallet
371984,that is rather easy to track unless you split up the funds and also move your funds multiple times to increase the anonset
371985,its why tornado had standardized amounts
371986,aztec at the moment especailly with defi being added i could see some exchanges supporting zketh and zkdai directly no usa citizens tho
371987,whats the current anonymity set of aztec
371988,tornado has c 200k eth
371990,
371991,pretty good they are capping at 5eth or 10k dai
371992,thanks maybe with a deposit cap in place they will be able to walk a fine line for longer nk and hackers wont find much use with such a cap
371993,whats so hard about swapping 100 eth xmr doing 2 or 3 swaps back out into a fresh wallet seems like a simple price to pay for anonymity
371994,they could still use it but would take a very long time
371995,timing analysis attack you have to wait awhile else people can track your output from eth back into eth then you have to deal with xmr price volatility
371996,liquidity
371997,wasnt that the case with tornado anyway minus the volatility
371998,last i checked btcxmr liquidity still hasnt picked up
371999,you100 eth xmrmoves around deposits 100eth backcasees 100 eth swappedwaits to see where the new address for that eth will be
372000,chart xmr against eth time your swap when its in up trend quite simple
372001,it was eth the whole time you could deposit and wait months still the same amount of eth xmr could tank and you end up with less eth
372002,not as much since they forced set amounts
372003,anyone know of a good growth hacker
372004,just deposit 75 eth send 25 to next wallet
372005,yeah you would need to break it up way more for ca to be fooled
372006,time x anonset is the key
372007,timing the market is quite difficult lol
372008,yea id say that is the only hurdle currently in the way
372009,where are you swapping this eth to xmr
372010,hopefully not a cex not sure of any trustless xmr eth or eth xmr
372011,here is an example of this happening irl
372012,100 seems kinda low for proving this
372013,youre missing the point it would work for 1 100 or 1m dollars
372014,its a problem that effects every privacy protocol that touches the public sphere
372015,it would work for 0 reward perhaps someone knows but has financial incentive to not publicise that fact
372016,ah sorry i misread your comment
372017,does this show the total regardless of the token deposited in eth or is that only for eth deposited
372018,i think its only for eth
372019,zcash offers opt in privacy so thats kinda broken
372020,ah heres something that calculates the anonset for you
372021,yeah opt in privacy will always be more vulnerable to spying and crackdowns
372023,buy the rips sell the dips
372024,atomic swaps are on chain you can still use services like sideshift etc
372025,sideshift is a cex
372026,its half a dex now
372027,from what i can tell it tries to find a decentralized way to swap your coins and if it cant it asks you for kyc
372028,sideshift doesnt ask for kyc
372029,hope we dont jinx it though
372030,my mistake im thinking of shapeshift
372031,sideshift operates outside of us jurisdiction already
372032,sideshift just gives you back your coins
372033,yeah
372034,doesnt matter even a little bit if americans can use it
372035,vpn tor i2p
372036,sure
372037,its great for swapping smaller amounts crosschain
372038,heres the playbookfbi agent emails you informing you they are american trying to swapyou do nothingthey swaprekt
372039,just about every piratedarknetcustodial mixeretc takedown follows that process
372040,hows that broken even if you do atomic swap to transparent taddress you can then shield it and do a fully shielded zz transaction to whatever address you need for whatever amount you want and nobody on earth would be able to trace it the problem with zcash is that you kinda have to do your homework to be able to use it properly
372041,its broken in the same way that it doesnt matter if your privacy is hermeticallysealed if the recipient of your messages is more open than a basketball hoop
372042,ok i see what you mean
372043,if youre lucky you may be fortunate enough that your recipient cares about privacy as much as you do but do their recipients and so on when enough people are nonprivate then the scheme is kinda useless its like covering yourself with a black cloth in the middle of a lit room and thinking no one sees you its how things like fb and friends can get your information even though you never gave it to them directly your family clicks through yes on all the permissions like robots they dont know any better and those companies will gladly hose up all available data
372044,i only know of one team that does this
372045,shilling ze bag banteg thx for the example of treasury transparency did too
372046,yis
372047,well the worst that can happen to you is that they leak that funds they received were from you yet this information wont disclose your bank account to everyone nobody still will be able to see what you do with your funds isnt this financial privacy
372048,shielded txs are on by default now
372049,iirc
372050,you want privacy use cash or share private keys kek
372051,cant track transactions if it never moves
372052,were slowly moving into cashless society wont always be an option
372053,if enough people are that way then youre the guy in the middle of a lit room running around with a black cloth over their head screaming im invisible
372054,yeah well if nobody cares about privacy then we are fd by default i try to be a lil more optimistic
372055,it offers some sort of privacy i suppose but for the same reason i wouldnt advise you try to drink a cup of water with a fishing net id advise you want to consider alternatives first
372056,not me this is haram
372057,if true then thats better
372063,nan
372064,i dont believe this is the case they removed trusted setup tho which is also cool
372065,i think zcash tries to play it nice to not get tornadoed
372066,zook is definitely pro reg
372067,go read his twitter
372068,i dont think its a bad thing if done right
372069,if done right is a huge if though
372070,yeah it seems like its public by default and the consequences are cleara ttot transaction works just like bitcoin the sender receiver and transaction value are publicly visible while many wallets and exchanges exclusively use taddresseses today many are moving to shielded addresses to better protect user privacy
372071,you dont get it
372072,thats definitely blackclothlitroom privacy
372073,there is no standard to which you can satisfy ok ivan
372075,coine_r sambacha u both are very smart but doesnt excuse 1 word per message more so related to sam tbh
372076,i guess if no one uses shielded options then it is kinda pointless
372077,im still waiting to see what zcash can cook up and how privacy narrative will evolve not looking good tbh
372078,crypto exchange nuri previously called bitwala files for insolvency in germany link
372079,moonwell launches governance forum and gauntlet publishes a review of moonwell post nomad
372080,yeah unless those dreaded criminals stake their entire eth in lido and dump received tokens in curve and its down only from here hyperbole maybe hopefully
372081,oh niceused to be a bitwala client back in 2017 was excited about their new releasethat quickly stopped since they had the most fuckin impossible kyc ive seen in my life
372083,xmr zcash privacy by default optional privacy
372084,its you choice to believe that i dont blame you but personally i dont buy into moneros fam arguments about zcash and its my choice lets leave it there
372086,as long as youre for privacy youre good with me
372087,its the same principle as with tor the risk always comes from interacting with the clearnet not onion sites
372088,the closer you can get to a circular system the easier it is to defend that systems privacy
372089,someone is trolling celebs by sending eth from tornado casharticle
372090,tbf that was all due to solaris bank being in charge
372091,bitwalanuri iswas just a shinier frontend
372092,they offered celcius staking in their app maybe thats the reason
372093,oooooooof
372094,eur funds are safu with solaris theyre saying
372095,well as long as we need offon crypto ramps this is going to be a problem i see no way around it
372096,thanks i know one more name not to touch wasted so much time with that bullshit
372097,even so minimizing the amount of data that can be collected helps lower the spying potential that said onramps have
372098,buying xmr with fiat only tells the exchange how much xmr you have buying eth tells the exchange everything that youre doing on eth
372099,
372100,there are many better alternatives since 2014 just not adopted privacy always was developed just didnt go in parallel with defi so far check pivx nav plenty of those
372103,the link is about tornado though
372104,you are right something was not right there
372105,lobster daily 497 daily recap 8 august1 how will liquity handle the eth pow and pos dramalink to discussion 2 best address visualization toollink to discussion 3 specially designated nationals list update tornado cash added read link to discussion 4 bad collateral is the root cause of recent collapses like terra not algorithmic stablecoins link link to discussion 5 sideline capital does 23 billion count as size link link to discussion

372107,
372108,yay midjouney pics
372109,doesnt say exclusively
372110,its our lobs commuity art from the kingdom
372111,nan
372112,werent pools already frozen
372113,not on uniswap and curve but on tornado
372114,sounds like a good exit strategy for circle
372116,sams take is pretty naive
372117,i think you missed the point
372118,i mean what else can he say
372119,oh i get your point but so far almost every crypto statement labelled as unlikely has happened
372120,but that also wasnt my point my point is that it wasnt as easy as just blacklisting 1 address that only frax controls it is unlikely but it can happen yes but our structural holding of usdc is different than makers for example which is entirely in psm contracts
372121,i get your point but since addresses are not formally owned by entities like bank accounts are it really doesnt matter from the ofacs point of view if frax is sanctioned usdc may be compelled to blacklist a wide scope not narrow one we are in uncharted territory here but we knew this day would come its high time we prepare for the next one
372122,i literally said this in the op tweet verbatim so im not sure what your point is
372123,yeah but they can blacklist the address depositing to those pools
372124,tornado has its gitcoin grants blacklisted technically an address operated by an external service
372125,if you read the original tweet thats literally what i said
372126,it was so sloppy this cant be where it ends sams post has good context
372127,wtf
372129,nan
372130,since when
372131,they dont have to blacklist the uniswap pool they can blacklist you depositing address then the usdc will stay there forever so what you said about having to blacklist others as well is not correct
372132,blacklist is permanent too
372133,what is interesting is that if you permit a router like uniswap they may end up blacklisting it too
372134,no thats not true if youre talking about the blacklist function go look at the code its an actual function that takes a single address as an argument
372135,maybe still validating this
372136,digital gulags
372137,well not exactly ofac can blacklist anything true but that doesnt affect onchain usdc on the other hand does so saying its unlikely usdc blocks public pools is a bit of a stretch since its beyond their control were not in kansas anymore sadly
372138,
372139,i havehence your depositing address can be blacklisted and then your lp withdrawal doing a transfer will fail
372140,agreed i actually do agree with you about that
372141,yup
372142,they can not unban it
372143,you simply send lp token to another address wdym
372144,not advice
372145,potentially some one does this as an attack on a vault
372146,sure but thats not a problem theres a timelock and dao upgrade policy to withdraw from a new address the only way to actually get the usdc frozen is either hit it permanently in a contract that frax dao has at the time of blacklisting or it wont be effective
372147,yaexactly
372148,yeah that should workor a permitif they dont have some automation tracking those
372149,they hand typed addresses from etherscan so id bet not yet
372152,they do not at least that is my understanding
372153,a matter of time innit
372154,as in the code has no method to remove addresses from the blacklist or out of principle
372155,nan
372156,new pinned message after a year ffs
372157,how more clear can this be rhethorical question do not answer
372158,sounds good to me off to the kingdom
372160,we re just all scared sir
372169,so scared all my frens got banned
372172,link to the kingdom at list
372180,sers we just reached 20k today
372181,ivan is going to give a speech or not
372183,nan
372185,buy to spam much better than play to earn
372187,curve ui seemingly getting mitm attacked dont use atm
372188,quick announcement we have become aware of a potential issue on the front end that could lead to approving a bad contract for your safety we ask that everyone not make any approvals or swaps until we can locate the issue and make sure its safe
372189,can confirm a friend of mine got his wallet drained after an approval
372190,
372192,amen
372193,curve finance frontend seems compromised has a malicious approval tx popping up
372194,these daily hacks are getting tiresome ngl
372195,its only the beginning security in web3 is a meme
372196,agree but we will get better stronger
372197,anyone know anything about the new web3 gaming company limitbreak by gabe leydon and the other machine zone founder always been a fan of gabe leydon and his thinking about games over the years just saw that theyd raised and are in stealth curious if anyone happens to know more will probably reach out to him
372198,always same issues web2 to web3 has a lot of vulnerabilities js and dns issues all the time
372199,the recession started this year those numbers are going to skyrocket
372200,cant apply to lusd no governance cant freeze someone from minting more lusd as long as they have the eth for collateral its only counterparty is the value of eth
372201,this is also not true lusd uses chainlink oracles and chainlink oracles are proxy patterned to be upgradeable by chainlink signers
372202,true but chainlink oracles can pretty much break all of defi then is there anyway to change the oracle provider if necessary in the future
372203,this
372204,well im just correcting your take that it does indeed require trust in the chainlink signers for the oracle that lusd uses
372205,thats why ppl say to be careful with chainlink fwiw
372206,its using tellor as a backup and no contracts are immutable weve also seen the first smart contract ban whats to say that lusd or any oracle supplying data to those isnt getting flagged in the future
372207,well yes i should have said excluding chainlink both frax lusd seem like it would take immense lockdown of the blockchain to be shut down however
372208,tellor alone is not a reliable source liquity would dry up in that scenario
372209,yeah fully aware just saying its living cause chainlink allows it to its just another centralized entity that can be forced to act in a certain way tho
372210,kinda why i think rai lusd
372211,they have left the oracle vector open to switch in case of this fuckery
372213,lusd is just rekt
372215,doesnt rai use chainlink as well
372216,although you need to proceed with caution but curveexchange seems to be unaffected uses a different dns provider
372217,pretty scary ive wondered this about chainlink for a couple years now
372218,yeah but they can point elsewhere
372219,lusd cant since its immutable
372220,lusd isnt exclusively dependent on chainlink
372221,stated above that its using tellor as a backup
372222,if it fails tellor kicks in and if both fails well then it dies as it should
372223,but that is better than the pretend game of maker and frax
372224,meh same shit really doesnt really matter if circle is forced to blacklist if chainlink is forced to upgrade or if they sanction everybody using the tellor smart contract right theyve pretty much shown that theyre willing to do either of those things in the last couple of days
372225,you kinda have to win the legal battle against them being able to literally blacklist entire smart contracts
372227,what could cause tellor to fail
372228,its not really the same one group sells a fiatcoin wrapper as something its not the other is pretty straightforward about its dependencies
372229,a shame in hindsight that they dont use an onchain oracle but v3 didnt exactly exist at the time so
372230,if chainlink blacklists lusd due to sanctions isnt it even worse that all the contracts are immutable and not changeable by lqty holders with no governance because if there was some kind of governance it would be easy to just switch to a twap or other oracle but it permabricks lusd
372231,thats the only viable solution kinda the moment you depend on people for price data its kinda gg but even then what uniswap pair do we use for the peg cant use ethusdt or ethusdc can we
372232,if that was the only thing such a governance could do youd have a point but considering such governance could be sanctioned to brick it themselves its dubious
372233,then its gonna be using tellor indefinitely its gonna get exponentially more risky and people are gonna look for the exit prolly
372234,and governance is also an attack vector
372236,of course you can getting pricing data doesnt rise to the level of a sanction
372237,im just worried about the total immutability of lusd contracts because if chainlink stops serving lusd right now it is not possible for lusd holders lqty holders or any of the greater community to do anything its basically over
372238,i mean could be argued nah in essence its enabling the creation of this decentralised stable and if were talking about lusd being attacked it kinda means there is a reason right so what prevents circle from being forced to blacklist uniswap pools because they deliver price reference data that allows for illegal decentralised stablecoins to be build
372239,the issue has been found and reverted if you have approved any contracts on curve in the past few hours please revoke immediately please use curveexchange for now until the propagation for curvefi reverts to normalthe contract that needs to be revoked is 0x9eb5f8e83359bb5013f3d8eee60bdce5654e8881 if you have approved it please revoke it immediately on
372240,the delivery is merely coincidental though if anything circle will be asked to blacklist it because uniswap facilitates illegal currency exchange which is far more likely
372241,at which point people will maybe consider pegging to something other than usd for their fiatcoin experiments
372242,i mean were dealing with people that have not thought through the entire tc ban at this point i wouldnt be surprised about shit like this happening
372243,can we freeze or sanction the circle blacklist using lusd or rai from a legal perspective
372244,think the major issue is that were trying to peg to anything in the first place we either deal with centralized entities issuing themand then wrap that shit 10 times centralized oracles making them possible or governance being able to attack the peg all of which doesnt sound too promising tbh its compromises on top of compromises
372245,yeah thats not great no upgradable gov
372246,nope none it is entirely immutable and decentralized lqty has no gov rights
372247,so if chainlink decides to upgrade their contracts so lusd cant use them then nothing can be done its over
372248,i mean theoretically it will continue running as long as tellor reports prices and if none of the oracles report anymore it will use last known price forever
372249,but it could be argued that if chainlink blacklists them its kinda over
372250,it seems like protocols aiming to be core primitives need to be upgradable or entirely selfcontained
372251,i guess it isnt over in an instant to be fair like you said if the code continues to report the last price reported from the oracles then it should hopefully give enough time for lusd holders to sell everything they have before its too late but id assume the peg would be even more volatile than it currently is right now so thats kind of not a great outcome either
372252,thats my view as well
372253,as someone working on oracles i think if youre actually building something with oracles and youre not able to adjust to potential changes youre in for a world of trouble too much can change andor can go wrong having blind trust in any oracle project is kinda insane
372254,totally which is why ive always been confused about lusd holders bragging about how literally nothing in the code is ever changeable and its forever immutable
372255,that would make sense for something like uniswap or an amm basically any tool needs to be a nonchanging structure but doesnt make sense for anything that is trying to be stable value
372256,cant they just create new contracts and get ppl to convert long way around but usually works just get ppl to close positions over time and migrate i mean someone deployed the intial contracts right same someone could deploy new ones
372257,immutability meme out the window tho
372258,that doesnt work if youve integrated lusd into your protocol every single thing up the stack would also need to change
372259,yep precisely it would be over
372260,but can be changed is the thing better to change course then hit the iceberg you see coming
372261,why not change it through governance instead thats the point it should be governable if its a stablecoin its not like its uniswap or base layer consensus contracts or anything
372262,do you redeploy with upgradable oracles then or redeploy with immutable contracts again if nr2 who would use you if youre gonna migrate to a new version everytime you will face some oracle troubles
372263,if requires goverance then thats the only way but someone will have to release the contracts and update front end
372264,oracles are an issue that plagues solidity and chainlink is a center point of failure if you code it is as your only oracle source ever then screwed if they go down should pull from a basket of oracle feeds or some self twap value
372265,i think the important thing to understand here is that all of these are tradeoffs people saying lusd is impervious to most things that dai or frax are weak against is not quite right because daifrax are impervious to a lot of things that are simple fixes for us but would rek lusd and force them to redeploy everything basically be dead
372266,what about mim
372267,
372268,its all kind of moot because lusd liquidity multiples below dai or frax so its not a go to large scale solution and being ham stringed by immutability is not a plus in mind crypto if anything is ever changing
372273,depends unlike chainlink tellor isnt permissioned
372274,agreed 100 each protocol has certain strengths and value propositions though none are perfect
372276,so for as long as someone is willing to report the price it should continue to work
372277,report price accurately and often tellor doesnt do either at least in the past
372278,youre not thinking through what youre proposing the attack youre proposing against lusd would be completely unnecessary if it had a pretendao because they would simply need to go after said pretendao
372279,the only reason you need to jump through the hoop of going to chainlink is because it is impervious to a direct attack that frax and makerdao arent just vulnerable to but also to the pretendao risk
372280,wtf is a pretendao is that like a derogatory way of saying fake dao
372281,its what they are in practice
372282,k cool still doesnt change the fact that if lusd had a fake dao it would not be entirely rekt if chainlink updated their contracts to remove them but great point i guess
372283,if it had a pretendao there would be no need to go to chainlink
372284,you simply ask the dao to brick it or end up in jail wanna see how many people are willing to risk their freedom for some online voting game
372285,that was admittedly a problem in the past last time i checked they reduced the possible time in between updates as for accuracy well that is dependent on the amount of people doing the updates and watching the network
372286,you cant put a dao in jail if you mean the actual msig signers or something then the oracle setting should only be an onchain tokenholder vote like a governorbravo type contract since it is so critical to a stablecoin system like lusd makerdaos oracles are actually well done in terms of how they need to be updated
372287,you cant put a smart contract in jail either how is this usefulwhat stops the tokenholders from voting a dead address in as the new oracle
372288,last 60 days on polygon a single address fulfilled all requests also lets not kid ourselves the moment chainlink would blacklist everybody would stop using lusd
372289,i dont understand what youre saying the only thing im pointing out here is that lusd being so immutable that you cant even change the oracle in any way other than a hardfork to a new token addresssystem contract is bad everyone must already implicitely trust the chainlink oracle will keep serving liquity if they are holding lusd
372290,youre claiming governance would solve a hypothetical problem the governance you propose has the same failure state
372291,sure the idea that an absence of a pretendao in liquity solves anything here is a farce
372292,ya this is what im saying too
372293,yep thats basically what im saying in effect lusd is just like any other pretendao as you like to call it the pretendao is just chainlink rather than something else
372294,it doesnt never pretended it but hammering out a stablecoin that is practically via proxy in full control of chainlink is also semi nice
372295,
372296,not sure what youre talking about you can literally go to both appfraxfinance or daistatscom and get a real time transparent view of how much frax and dai are fiat wrapped but it took 20 minutes of arguing here for you to admit lusd is a chainlink pretendao so we should call it even i guess
372297,both of them claim to be decentralized stablecoins
372298,they are at best fiatcoin wrappers
372299,so does lusd the chainlink pretendao
372300,fin
372301,an ethcollateralized stablecoin that uses chainlinks oracles nonexclusively is different from fiatcoin wrappers with actual pretendaos that are also dependent on the very same oracles
372302,bru
372303,being open about their dependencies somehow never shows up on all the tweets and info they put out together with the infuennzzaaa stuff they retweet
372304,nan
372305,nan
372306,youll find it buried in le docs tho
372307,unstoppable as long as chainlink allows it to be
372309,youre right its even worse because they cant even change being a chainlink pretendao through their own pretendao process
372310,the entirety of your argument is i can muddy the waters by claiming were all the same since we use chainlinks oracles but were better in this way because if we get blacklisted by chainlink our pretendao can do something when the reality is if it was possible to fix that problem in liquity the chainlink dependency is completely irrelevant as they simply go straight to the dao the point is moot at best
372311,but such disingenuity is par for the course
372312,cool i guess different flavors of pretendaos for different people i suppose just remind the lusd fans to at least brand themselves as a pretendao just like us but they can omit the fiatcoin wrapper part sure
372313,they would be branded with it if lqty was a governance token but good attempt
372314,youre right link is their governance token and the cl msig signers
372315,does that make your fiatcoin wrapper dependent on 2 daos
372316,might want to consider giving link holders tangible governance powers in those votes then
372317,after all your governance can add that
372318,might as well do that and also let usdc holders vote too right
372319,or you can read thisrecovering from a doubleoracle failurein the extreme and unlikely event that both oracles fail liquity uses the last good price seen for all operations effectively freezing the price used by the systemhowever liquity still does its best to recover and switch back to the primary oracle when it comes back online
372320,you should youre the one with the idea that a 3rdparty dependency constitutes a dao after all
372321,throw in eth too
372322,ive seen the presentation theyve given live at the oracle summit in berlin and the exact same questions where asked there their answer was they cant change anything and are beyond rekt if their oracles failchange its an active choice they made you still have them running around on twitter and pretending to be the more decentralised dai and retweeting shit of people that pretend that while being at the full mercy of a 49 multisig with no way to ever potentially overcome that hurdle
372323,they are more decentralized than dai this is objectively true
372324,kek at that honestly anything using a glorified multisig and calling itself decentralised is a farce that kinda goes out to all of defi
372325,at least maker votes on the people deploying the unit that makes their oracles possible
372326,why do you keep writing like theyre exclusively dependent on chainlink
372327,because we both know the project goes to 0 once that dependancy is gone
372328,what does that have to do with pretending theyre exclusively dependent on chainlink
372329,because its a bit of a farce to justify their immutable contracts simply deploying a immutable contract with a centralized oracle project goes against the nature of a decentralised stablecoin so slap tellor in there for the lulz and the decentralisation part even though they will never be used and their entire tvl will omega nuke if chainlink ever stops serving them stop the pretend game pls
372330,not sure why you think doubling down on the same lie is an answer to the question
372331,so would you say our biggest risk for decentralized stables may be oracles can we not create a purely on chain dataset for 1 all eth stable or eth wbtc swap values can allow us to derive the value of 1 from that rough draft of how system could work could cut out price feeds from off chain sources and create an immutable on chain unit of accounting where data sets can always derive values from
372332,is the glib slap tellor in there supposed to be serious or are you grasping at straws to make a point
372333,as for whether it would actually go to 0 torn is still well above 0
372334,no if i were being frank with you i think the real challenge for decentralized stablecoins is that there does not appear to be any actual way to scale them without taking on some real world custody aka fiatcoin risk i mentioned this yesterday too let me forward you what i wrote
372335,its for many reasons not just the volatility of eth but all you need to know is that every stablecoin built only with the overcollateralized asset model is only a fraction of a fraction of either dai or fraxs mcap this is not a coincidence you should take this real world data to heart it is clearly illustrating a point lusdfeisusdrai all combined dont even reach 800m market cap although i love all of them each of their individual unique innovations is something to learn from and their teams are world class but they are all incredibly small were not trying to build a stablecoin for ants it simply is not going to grow past a certain size by using those models crypto does not have any evidence of a single overcollateralizedonly stablecoin that grows in size rather than shrinks over time
372336,but a few years ago dexs were never gonna make it either
372337,im literally reiterating with a bit more drama what liquity presented at the oracle summit better aligns with our values a decentralised backstop theyre fully aware that their entire construct relies on a centralized entity and their setup even when switched to the backup will continuously try to default to chainlink once theyre available its the preferred choice to be fully in the hands of cl instead of using the project that better aligned with their values obviously im gonna meme if you still go with the centralized one because the reasons are pretty damn obvious the moment cl is gone liquity is gonna do everything in their power to fork thats why its a farce
372338,just because something hasnt happened yet doesnt mean it wont
372339,the question is whether it can scale not what has happened so far they dont scale till they do
372340,youve regurgitated the same point 3 times
372341,again why do you think doubling down on the same lie is an answer to the question
372342,very true but so far the evidence points to the overcollateralizedonly model itself is not what is going to do that there might be some unique innovation and new stability mechanism that is fully decentralized that can scale into the billions onchain entirely but so far evidence does not show that yet it doesnt appear to be the overcollatonly model
372343,well they definitely arent scaling by doing the same exact mechanism again and again nonstop that has only shrunk over time theres probably some yettobeinvented mechanism possibly
372344,based gigachad
372346,who are you scaling for
372347,just stop taking this guys bait lmao
372348,well clearly not lusd users since theres only 180m mcap demand in total from them
372349,even if over collateralized stables become a niche the oracle problem still seems to be much larger than i realized
372350,clearly lol
372352,
372353,any thoughts on this folks would love to hear some alternative opinions
372354,overall i feel like contract approvals used to be a necessary evil for proper ux but these days more thought should be put into it for example an eip that would allow for data with token transfers
372355,but also think theres something im missing from the technical benefits of it
372356,  
372357,hahaha
372358,felt the stablecoin debate was very onesided my comment on liquity and in favor of nonupgradable contracts became too lengthy so shared it in a couple of tweets
372359,the govt has access to chainanalysis so this is pretty silly it would take them less time to filter out the noise than it took to create
372360,the reality is quite simple pointing these things out is bad for the people that have vested interest is distracting everyone from it so muddying the waters by claiming its all the same is the only strategy they have left
372361,its quite similar to the grifter argument a while ago dare i say virtually identical alas you would expect nothing less from the principal parties involved in selling these things
372362,you might want to check what the word grifter means in the dictionary it means smallscale swindling seeing as how lusd is barely 12 and 2 the size of frax and dai respectively only one side here looks like the grifter you might want to just default to calling everything else a scam next so everyone at least knows your true colors
372363,lol might want to read the post youre replying to again if you think im calling you a grifter
372364,staying at home and making money is one thing i enjoy doing most i found out an investment company that has 100 guarantee and trust in trading and i get 6btc within 24 hours after i have invested 1 btc with the help of mr scott barnes the head admin join him telegram channel today and make moneytelegrammejoinchatxbtes410i5viowi0
372365,i mean there is definitely a label id use but its not that one and i was simply referencing an argument from a week or so ago
372366,its a quote to a tweet defending the chainlink relianceimmutability isnt it which was part of the earlier pretendao fiatcoin wrapper conversation in any case i actually have nothing against lusd or anything i do like it a lot i just dont like people pointing out fair critiques of frax and dai while ignoring fair ones of smaller stablecoins thats all
372367,isnt itno it isnt why you think that well carry on feel free to search for grifter in here if youre interestedas for lusd vs the fiatcoin wrappers yes i dont like it either when the wrappers try to sell themselves as something theyre not and if there is a tangible benefit to fiatcoin wrapping then we should have one in the manner of liquity without the pretendao games
372368,most arent ignoring the issues associated with smaller stables we know theyre small and are difficult to scale theyre issues not projectending risks thoughchallenge with the usdc wrappers is that yes they can scale but at what costs to decentralization and censorshipresistance so i think asking those questions are good especially given the threat of centralization to the trust people have placed in these assets
372369,its not like the fiatcoins are changing anytime soon if thats the selling point of dai and frax then a wethesque immutable contract for the lot of them ought to be doable
372370,i agree with you on that
372371,amazon announces it can clone anyones voice with just a samplerohit prasad the head scientist for alexa ai demonstrated amazons new neural texttospeech technology that allows replication of ones voice if theres just a minutelong samplethe system is reportedly capable of imitating pronunciation as well as patterns of rhythm stress and intonationamazon hasnt announced when it plans to make voicecloning available to the developers and the public
372372,
372373,i wonder if there is a reason why dao wont vote for implementing restrictions in similar situation
372374,thanks seems like a solid thread why did he feel it was necessary to delete half of it including the one you shared
372375,a reason pretty easy something about decentralization or similar will it actually affect the outcome though dont hold your breath
372376,it will be another case of storytelling slamming headfirst into reality
372377,you could probably do this with open source models if the given sample is diverse enough if i say lodster flibert over and over again for 60s the amazon algorithm probably wont be able to do any meaningful extrapolation
372378,i am starting to regret my previous career as a voice over
372379,but amazon probably have enough of your voice to splice together 60s of useful audio
372380,alexa was definitely not used for this pinky swear
372381,well yeah i mean its tokenbased governance where voters expect that tokens they used to vote for dao decisions appreciate in price or at least dont fall much if they dont comply with regulation they are taking risk of significant price drop delisting from centralized exchanges being cut from centralized stablecoins etc or simply cut off from most popular wallets and rpc providers daos in fact arent made for rebels against the state
372382,daos are trojan horses
372383,my github was not blocked but my tornado clone disappeared
372384,daos in fact arent made for rebels against the statewouldnt that mean theyre not autonomous
372385,autonomous from what
372386,the three first definitions arenot controlled by others or by outside forces independent independent in mind or judgment selfdirected independent of the laws of another state or government selfgoverning
372387,if its just an extention of a particular gov or jurisdiction then its just a do
372388,unless im missing something
372389,cough no youre not cough
372390,which is why my preferred label is pretendao because they can be neither decentralized nor autonomous making the name questionable at best nice portmanteau methinks lol
372391,
372392,some useful tools to check approved contracts
372397,is there a site that you can use to check transaction parameters such as set slippage for an ethereum swap
372398,that is not etherscan

372410,zerobridge has this feature
372411,afaik this bridge based on renvm and it have ability to mint ren coins
372412,so its a sideproject of ren or something like this if they have signatures able to call mint function of gateway
372413,zerobridge is built by zerodao using ren yes not our product though
372414,messari blocked in the balkans can anyone else thats in the balkans try pls croatia works the rest of us random countires not
372415,is there any easy way of determining what the price impact would be for a large onchain trade like converting 50 million worth of eth to stables just curious about the liquidity available onchain
372416,you can check some aggregator for price impact i guess
372420,but you has strong partnership if you permitted them to mint your tokens or i didnt fully understand the architecture of zero
372421,anyone can generate deposit gateways to renvm transfer assets and submit to renvm to be allowed to mint even other bridges and smartcontracts
372422,trying to solve a case more so for fundeleted a profile from chrome a couple of weeks ago it had metamask installed i thought it was empty but turns out it had 05 eth on one accountdidnt save the seedphrase private keys cause it was an old side acc that i didnt usei have a mac dont use its sdd much so likely not overwritten yetso i got disk drill but cant seem to find a proper way to restore the needed file as far as i understood its the ldb file but dd doesnt show them like at allthere is another recovery utility that does show them but theyre all paywalled and im not sure if its worth trying to pay a license if the problem is unsolvable anyone gone through this
372423,thank you to make it clear
372424,i saw 400 messages this morning i wanted to skip it glad i didnt the debate regarding stablecoin was amazing learnt a lot
372425,if its a constant product amm it should be pretty easy to just do the math
372426,there were a convo about that a few days ago someone asking about how to erase a dd when selling a computer farm42 would be interesting to see this in practice
372427,not talking about a single amm but essentially as a whole like if someone were to offload a 100 million position in eth for stables irrespective of the swap
372428,check 1inch paraswap matcha
372429,sure parhfinders do it right
372430,ah fair enough i guess you could pick the top 5 or 10 amm which likely have a large fraction of total liquidity add it up and then do the xyk on that
372431,is pathfinders a project or you mean something like 0x1inch
372432,yeah but its not readily available i guess i can write a python script for it good opportunity to test ape framework
372433,ssd recovery is usually impossible due to trim and how the hardware works its different from hdds
372434,equations for uni v2 style liquidity in my paper hereour oracle attack simulator allows you to calculate this exactly for uni v3oracleeulerfinance
372435,ah yeah if you want a real answer thatd be the way to go i figure just a quick spreadsheet with numbers from the top amms would get reasonably close
372436,
372437,heres a sheet i quickly modified from some old twap analysis you can do the opposite to what you want here you can change the target price and ask how much liquidty would need to be swapped to move the price from 1 to 120
372438,does anyone know if the torn token itself is sanctioned
372441,its not
372442,im pretty sure i see a bunch of these files available for recovery im just trying to understand if it will work or not
372443,re stablecoins really looking forward to crvusd mich and the team have a stellar track record and they control both the oracles and the upcoming stable so i hope its implemented without chainlink who knows maybe without oracles completely a la ruler
372444,
372445,privacy is critical so we leak all your data to feds

372447,renbridge has been used to launder at least 540 million in crimerelated crypto cash since 2020 according to elliptic link
372448,how can ren be used to launder money when the bridge transactions are all public and visible on chain
372449,asking for a fren
372450,
372453,exactly seems like hit piece
372454,the same way darknet criminals use private anonymous bitcoin for child trafficking and buying drugs or so msm says
372455,dont let the truth get in the way of a good story
372456,
372457,nan
372458,
372459,wtf why i didnt know this
372460,milkyklim taught me this
372461,isnt this a huge security assumption from safes side
372462,when there was a signed protocolpause tx and he was like ivan u moron
372463,yes so never sign xx
372464,more considering that it isnt a private environment
372465,lmao
372466,yes this is why you should never keep security stuff hanging
372467,so basically you cant ever execute a trade through gnosis kinda
372468,last signer should always exec essentially
372469,how come theres no private gnosis environment sounds like a no brainer to me
372470,they could potentially frontrun you if you fuck up the settings
372471,ah true
372472,its impossible to sign and not broadcast for example
372473,to finally broadcast through flashbots for example
372474,nan
372475,this is our future speculative pre cog banning
372477,need a blockchainpowered mindreading module and then you can arrest before a crime is committed
372478,shit hit the fan but nobody wants to get dirty simple
372479,checkmate dprk
372481,
372482,i want to validate on this and do mev
372483,didnt ren aztec partner to enable shielding renbtc in zkmoney
372484,hi lobsters my name is giancarlo im trying to learn more about the way you all are building in web3 would you mind taking a couple of minutes to go through a survey i just prepared happy to share the results afterwards poap giveaway at the end
372485,lol proof of nonmalicious thoughts will be the sybil and forcefully induced strokes will be the method of slashing
372487,ahahaha great concept lets go to vcs
372488,what was the aim of the survey as it didnt ask any detailed question
372489,whats the most gas efficient way to airdrop 6k nfts
372490,distribute it with merkletree proof
372491,in other words let the users pay for themself
372492,lets continue on nft_avenue the nft wing of lobsterdao
372495,the goal is to understand how are nocode tools being used and to what effectiveness within the web3 builder community i want to understand what are the biggest painpoints and opportunities in the space for us to build a new set of nocode tools to help you all build in the web3 easier
372496,users claiming for free with merkle root proof
372497,or choosing a cheaper chain
372498,otherwise just paying the 12000 dollars to do the drop try do it when gas is super low
372499,also if its not 6k unique addresses you wont have to make 6k txs and can save fees with erc721a
372500,eg if its 6k nfts to 50 addresses it wont be expensive to mint
372501,
372502,20 social points for answering here when youre already on nft ave
372503,bear market isnt really here without centralized exchanges collapsing
372504,the reason is that a former hotbit management employee who left hotbit in april this year was involved in a project last year that law enforcement authorities now think is suspected of violating criminal laws so a number of hotbit senior managers have been subpoenaed by law enforcement since the end of july and are assisting in the investigatiofurthermore law enforcement has frozen some funds of hotbit which has prevented hotbit from running normallyseems like somehow connected with tornado case
372505,15 hours ago hotbit officially launched kyc function20 minutes ago announcement on the suspension of hotbit website service
372506,
372507,definitely
372508,every bridge transaction is public its kind of needed either way for the bridge to work as it needs to tie a deposit with an address that is allowed to mint
372509,took out money from there last week only lmaoo
372510,saved myself
372511,sorry i actually glanced at your message and didnt actually know what you were referring to
372512,hah all good my bad too for the unaware lobsterdao has a second channel for just nft research
372513,ripple labs interested in bankrupt crypto lender celsius assets spokesperson reutrs3bnuqpf
372514,luna is more likelywasnt there a hotbit korea
372515,whats a recommendable static page hosting solution to go hand in hand with that have used vercel so far but am afraid they gonna sanction me
372517,if youre looking for an ootb solution then i dont think you will get anything better than vercel wrt sanctionability
372518,they will all probably boot you off faster than you can fill in your password so its either you finagle something on njalla itself or host your own server
372519,input my addy
372524,how is web3 better sanctions are forced upon you the same as on web2
372525,because that was not rly web3
372526,a reply to a message from february lol
372527,yea i know namecheap isnt web3 but lets use tornado as an example here how is it any better
372528,you can still use tornado
372529,still permissioneless still working you can use it youll just piss off uncle sam
372530,you can still use tornado if you are a really advanced crypto user if everyone needs to learn how to use every single dapp without a proper ui we are going backwards and not forwards
372531,when this comment was made namecheap was one of the first organizations to ban russian userswithin that week many web3 daos and protocols done the same thing web3 wasnt proven to be better
372532,including infura the rpc provider metamask uses by default
372533,this isnt even my final form
372534,hey peeps there was this gsheet a while ago with payed shiller twitter accounts does anyone have that link somewhere ive been trying to find it but cant find it anywhere anymore blz help
372535,
372536,there is an ipfs hosted ui for tornado cash there are other uis that you can still use heck you can just download a single page html file and use tornado and more importantly you can create your own if tomorrow paypal just shutsdown you have no avenue to access thoss functionalities
372537,seems cheaper than previous ones
372538,beggars cant be choosers
372539,why do people subscribe to them you literally get dumped on and learn nothing
372540,to know when to dump
372541,they dont know about places like this are too unfamiliar to understand the discussions that go on influenceoors do a great job at explaining the relevance of projects x y and z to how they can make number go up this gets views the reason why videos have all these stupid faces on their thumbnails is because kids are prone to click on expressive faces and so the algo learned to promote them because kids are easy to monetise via advertising and they are more likely to watch the full video same deal with videos with green on them people watch them longer to get alpha etc so theyre a more valuable form of content to youtube etc meaning the algo promotes them creates a vicious cycle of promotion patterns they subscribe to them because its a accessible mentally and b heavily promoted to them by the information transmitting medium theyre accustomed towell thats my take anyway anyone got any other ideas
372542,and frankly keeping up with this world is an exhausting task even if you do understand it people with full time jobs cant spend all day monitoring anime tiddy pps
372543,shillfluencer talks about project numba goes up profitthats the general idea
372544,i mean influencers arent new even before the internet you had people on newspapers advising you which stock to buy most people dont use much of their brains when investing money they happily trust someone who calls himself an expert and does the easy work for them often with terrible results ever heard of this parabel
372545,in practice it goes a bit more like shillfluencer talks about project numba goes up some people profit horde that couldnt get out in time and couldnt care less about the project start asking for wen marketing generally the fate of those that cant get on the frontpage of insert established site and have more token holders than they do users
372546,nah the stupid face thing is universal even adults like it also i suspect that facial tracking lets thumbnailsvideos with famous faces gain a significant algo boost
372547,the bright green thing is actually slightly unknown theres a certain shade discovered by game theory that seems to work hilariously well to promote your videos with
372548,clickbait is unreasonably effective videoarticle comments
372549,these types of influencers battle for the top seo spot so anyone who is very new to crypto sees their video first thus subscribing thus thinking that the new garbage theyre shilling is amazing
372550,this video is excellent and i send it to clients to explain how even small tweaks can have outsized returns
372551,this post is excellent too
372552,lol yeah saw that on hn too
372553,honest title got virtually no traction
372554,this is a great book on this topic
372555,not true you can have honest clickbait
372556,mr beast is the biggest example if hes giving away an entire car dealership of cars in his title hes actually giving away an entire car dealership of cars
372557,honest clickbait sounds a tad like an oxymoron lol but i get it
372558,noob question if i have a code running that makes a txn and on my metamask someone or myself also make a transaction is there a chance that both collide and dont happen or is it something impossible to happen can i ask this type of question here
372559,probably can get nonce too high on the 2nd one if they collide
372560,the way i think of it is like a cake that looks nice but also tastes great
372561,most smart content tends to make a great tasting cake that looks like it was covered in sawdust
372562,i was using dove before they got acquired by messari so now im using crunch base but i was wonderingdoes anyone know of any alternative crypto vc funding websites groups or influencer pages which track all early stage vc funding crypto projects
372563,ditto i love dove mountain data but now its behind a messari paywall
372564,nan
372565,dove had a better overview tho sad to see it got bought
372566,im already in that group but thanks for suggestions also yea dove was my favorite but crunch base isnt too bad either
372567,does anyone else have the same issue with dydx
372568,starting to feel like the movie contagion
372569,damn
372571,nan
372572,yeah i got this a few days ago before tornado drama
372573,given their pivot to cosmos also relies on offchain elements is there any reason this compliance provider should not carry over
372574,hey guys im trying to deploy a simple erc721 contract from remix on goerli testnet just to test out a few things and when i try to approve the transaction in metamask it gives me this errorwhat could it mean
372575,ive tried it on a few other chains apart from mainnet and it gives the same error
372576,leverage short platform on bnb chain
372577,
372578,plz vote interested to see result
372579,with buy do you mean swapping eth that you have already decided to baghold for steth
372580,vercel netlify surge github pages there are so manyor aws s3 or even ipfs arweavecan also run your own servers not a big deal however you do it
372581,try deploy from hardhat or try brave browser remix can be funky sometimes simple browser switch has fixed it for me in the past
372582,considering github itself the tornado guys off immediately youre definitely getting rekt just the same if youre using github pages same goes for the rest that rely on 3rdparty companies
372583,ya i realise depends how popular you get or what youre doing but there are 100 ways to host static sites it doesnt really matter the domain getting hit is harder
372584,the only such 3rdparty that might be interested in shielding you is cloudflare and even they will yield when the pr is unfavorable
372585,i dont ever remember them dealing with sanctionlevel threats so that will be new territory lol
372586,sorta random but aws will definitely boot you off vercel and netlify are dependent on aws take from that what you will
372587,ya i might have messed up the question though maybe how big does the discount get would have been better
372588,signal has a proxy service specifically for this use case fyi
372589,
372590,the best censorship resistant alternative i know of is other alternatives are
372591,is another alternative
372592,found it odd how elliptic shows ren bridge activity in their slander piece so i made the chart to scale looks very different right
372593,nan
372594,my guess would be that theyre just inflating numbers to get more contracts it feels like they used riaastyle mathematics
372595,of course and journalists dont bother to check any of the claims
372596,that would require work editing and basic math skills
372597,they also called it a decentralized network of darknodes
372598,terrible piece
372599,i assume the darknodes were made by the shadowy superhackers i keep hearing about
372600,dprk statesponsored hacking nodes
372601,if anyone has the energy mackenzie seems keen to engage people i trust said she was engaging in good faith previously
372602,
372603,oh nice shes definitely worth contacting cnbc is big enough it might change the public perception about the elliptic report
372604,rip intel sgx
372605,sgx been dead for a while now
372606,ofc
372607,for the goerli testnet merge will we know instantly if it goes smoothly or not
372608,or will it take sometime
372609,isnt this the scrt chip
372610,yep
372611,their entire platform rests on one company and the worst chip on earth
372612,always found that so weird
372613,its basically a very cheap way to add privacy to something
372614,think they would have learnt after all the amt vulnerabilities
372615,aaaaaand were around 510 blocks away from goerli merge
372616,scrt is a decent piece of tech its predecessor enigma pioneered the use of zkps on ethereum 5 years ago but that doesnt help on sgx tho and many peeps have been saying this for a while
372617,nan
372618,lfgggg
372619,sooooo
372620,merge epoch hasnt finalized yet
372621,aint great right
372622,
372623,lolol
372624,i think merge epoch final now right
372626,how late was the reorg
372627,i saw pandas in lighthouse 30 mins after erigon
372628,seems a lot of people are not running a correct setup
372629,i dont think thats the case they probably wouldve dropped off during bellatrix hf or something
372630,aug 11 102954 bean goerlilighthousebn2333339 aug 11 022954001 info synced slot 3639749 block empty epoch 113742 finalized_epoch 113739 finalized_root 0x9469c31e exec_hash 0x920837ca verified peers 129 service slot_notifier

372633,are you using erigonlighthouse
372634,yes
372635,if there a way to get a goerli rpc without running a beaconnode
372636,no not atm
372637,
372638,hint its nothing
372639,ok
372640,if anyone wants serious brain damage
372641,dogechain just launched
372643,congrats everyone its a big milestone
372644,eth merge is on route
372645,is that why we just had that pump
372646,ah i see that the stock market had a good day too with inflation lower than expected
372647,what is the final date
372651,all core devs today will discuss the expected datettd
372652,timbeiko i didnt buy the dip yet how much to bribe to make you say unexpected delays and tweet it
372653,dumb question what happens to weth at fork
372659,unless there is logic to check the chain id and assuming the fork will have a different id to mainnet we would expect 11 redemption
372660,thanks makes sense
372661,i couldnt see anything in the contract that would prevent weth from working on a fork happy to be corrected by someone more knowledgeable
372662,
372663,
372664,
372665,hi everyone i have some very good solidity and rust developers in my radar is there anyone interested on this kind of profiles for their teams
372666,this huge
372667,dnssec and hsts is really not that hard to set up but most defi relies on some half ass pleb hosting setups made for shitty personal blogs
372668,i mean come on curve tvl is what 6b isnt it more than most retail banks that warrants an it department and a sec officer right
372669,ok dnssec but how hsts can help in this case isnt just forcing to use https
372670,cant hijack my dns if my certs are pinned
372671,i mean you can but it wont do much
372672,isnt that hpkp
372673,fair enough
372674,i thought that was like sorta deprecated too
372675,pardon if this is a stupid question how would mev work on pos assuming that there is full ecosystem migration
372676,pos just changes who gets to propose the block it doesnt change anything about what they get to do with it
372677,pga stays the same in pos it just change on who get to build the block
372678,minining pool miners validator nodes
372679,see mevboost for flashbots
372680,already live on testnets
372681,processing transactions too
372682,yes
372683,boostflashbotsnet
372684,sorry for another possibly stupid question will it affect manifold business somehow and in general will they be relevant in pos
372685,so effectively validator nodes control the mev attacks now it technically means that mev attacks are done in conjunction with nominators as well
372687,what do you think about this approach to spot alpha
372689,mev attack is still being done by searchers bot just validatingcreating blocks is done by validator nodes instead of mining poolnodes
372690,would nodes be penalized for malicious behavior if such attacks can be proven
372691,ordering and inclusion of valid transactions is not a slashable offense in pos if thats what youre asking
372692,yes exactly thanks
372693,
372696,sers asking for articles and 3 year old protocols tldr please ctrlf but better start with google honestly
372697,amd sev snp is indeed looking better this year
372698,they market themselves as altruistic educational content creators their followers dont know that they dump on them or dont believe it because they won a couple of trades following them i recently had a discussion with a wwg paying member and i tried to explain to him that hes literally subscribing to a pnd shared a zachxbt thread other threads showing how the founder dumps nfts while talking about them in a bullish manner yet he was satisfied with his 149 a month membership
372699,did he win anything from this 149 subscription
372700,surprisingly he claims that yes he did
372701,i mean most of these accounts wont have alpha groups
372702,and skeptical how helpful retweets from these accounts are huge waste of money if youre a creator paying these fees
372703,very few people will be listening and likely most of the followers are bots anyway
372704,in the past some influencers were valuable the nft instagram page was expensive but great roi for example but state of the market is different today
372705,would be interesting to see whats being shared in your friends alpha group but i doubt its paid promos
372706,the group might get in early because sharing the alpha frontrunning on price but skeptical that its an immediate pump and dump although you never know in this space
372707,oh it was one of their guys said they stopped shilling undisclosed everybody did that a few years ago but they did it heavily in 2021 until the end of the bull
372708,the zachxbt thread on wwg is pretty well detailed
372709,do you have a link to it
372710,this one
372711,ah ye
372712,yep this one x
372713,ah was thinking this was nft world harder to move markets as quick there although im sure there are similar groups too the whole space is messed up
372719,
372720,tradfi will love the fact that we made a stablecoin
372721,hey friendly lobsters id love some feedback on an article i wrote anyone would be down to do that thank you in advance
372722,
372723,any good tldr out there on the merge what happened successful saw some reorg stuff
372724,
372725,hey heyparadigm research new platform is up and ready for beta testing
372726,
372727,yoooooooooo
372728,yo fk i just swapped usdc to dai
372729,let me sleep u weirdos
372730,just swap to usdt safest out there
372731,fudded since years and doing fine
372732,
372733,ayo
372734,he just wants an excuse to get pegged on cam
372735,curve fine again btw
372736,it is but there is fake twitter account saying otherwise already been reported
372737,hetzner raising prices heads up if youre using them
372739,who here remembers float protocol
372740,me me me
372741,me made a decent amount on their whitelisted farming
372742,for those interested in the topic were live on a twitter space hosted by privacy projects re tornado cash sanctions
372743,
372744,lol good luck coordinating that one
372745,
372746,he literally wants to click the buy button
372747,and market buy
372748,panic mode
372750,hey dai you had one job jesus
372751,why would cdps not get liquidated
372752,isnt that the whole job of maker auctions
372753,
372754,if its no longer profitable to liquidate perhaps
372755,wont it tie in dai and eth in the same death spiral as lunaust
372756,no what
372757,the merge block noone cares
372758,merge ttd
372759,i think the idea is just way too much eth not enough demand for so much eth
372760,not exactly the same because lunaust had a circular dependency and in the case of ethdai dai depends on eth but not the opposite so i would say that its partially mitigated
372761,thisnot exactly the same but only because eth is more mature re independent sources of demand than luna was keep in mind luna was also a gas token so its not so dissimilarjust luna demand for gas was way less because terra was new
372762,well not the same mechanism ofcourse but if maker dao converts its 35 billion usdc to eth and then there is a free fall in eth price the constant liquidation pressure will most probably result in a severe depeg
372763,do you know of any resources about regulation in eu for companies that works with defi like exchanges banks
372764,does tether have the same centralization risks as usdccircle
372765,curious if the treasury can force tether to blacklist
372766,already done it
372767,tether has been frozen before
372768,yes worse cause less law controlled or maybe better cause less law controlled
372769,ser blz read up ctrlf idk how you can not know about usdt usdc freezes
372770,think its because liquidators might not be interested with keeper fees which is 3 discount to the ethdai pair when eths dropping 10 or more in a worst case scenario who would want to liquidate for 3
372771,the 3 discount is on top of the 10 drop so literally everyone would want to liquidate
372772,
372773,oasisapp started using trm labs like uniswap
372774,i emulated it here but its real you can look up in the source code
372775,both tokens has identical smartcontracts
372776,remember that before dai v2 it was fully collateralized by eth and have had no problems with it
372777,ust 20
372778,there would be no collateral to liquidatethe eth is eth while the cdps are denominated in usdc
372779,the ethereum merge has been scheduled for ttd 58750000000000000000000this is approximately sept 1516ththe merge is officially scheduled
372780,no my address got blocked too
372781,compliant safe and regulated is the future for mass adoption and growth we must strive to protec those that are too busy to protect themselves
372782,just checked and same but ive never been blocked on uniswap
372783,welp cant say we didnt see it coming
372784,is there an ipfs version of etherscan
372785,no it wouldnt make sense because youd still need the indexing stuff
372786,so if etherscan was to go down how else can we interact directly with a contract
372787,
372788,decentralized evm block explorer
372789,supports various evm chains
372790,try checking otterscan as well or twittercomtryethernal
372791,there are other tools you can use eg brownie or maybe ape
372792,decentralized how so
372793,afaik ipfs is only for static stuff
372794,can also have a full app with js and stuff served via ipfs would have to have some significant subgraph or api integration though to replicate etherscan functionality
372795,surprised pikachu
372796,defi became safi
372797,how are we supposed to start a fresh eth wallet these days with no tornado cash and every exchange being all up in our shits
372798,you can disable this risk feature for development purposes
372799,trade p2p and hope you dont get mugged
372800,monero
372801,bisq changenow
372802,we need to somehow increase the subset of users who care about privacy to as close to the whole population as possible making a privacy tool for an even smaller subset of the already the small subset of people who care about privacy only paints a bright target on the backs of those willing to go that extra step if everyone cared about privacy then this would be unenforceable using monero or bisq for example will have the exact same outcome we already saw think about how to meme privacy to a greater mass appeal only then can we hope to have the power to deflect this boot stamping on our faces
372803,thx i will look into these
372804,hi this is what we do
372805,
372806,also its not about increasing the subset who care so much as its increasing the amount of private by default tools for users that also provide incredible ux or unique experiences so they choose those tools more frequently
372807,changing the expectation on defaults is powerful because defaults are powerful but were in a public by default world w eth
372808,need more cigrets
372809,i will also say that if apple spending billions on a campaign literally branded privacy doesnt do it then we might need to adjust our expectations
372810,i misspoke meant open source
372811,anyone can fork the code and spin up their own evm explorer
372812,etherscan is miles off when it comes to features
372813,and iirc it only does pos poa chains
372814,you are not you are supposed to buy it from a kycd exchange using your credit card and then transfer to a wallet
372815,buy some video cards and mine i guess
372816,mining fresh coins for privacy i guess people cant do this anymore after the merge
372817,im just worried i will be put on a list for some of my purchases
372818,who knows how waifu nfts will be perceived by janet yellen
372819,promise someone to give send him 5 eth if he sends you one first
372820,it would be awesome if people couldnt see into other peoples bank accounts web3 wallets
372821,tornado have blocked themselves right
372822,nan
372823,should remove the bio
372825,hi everyone ive been working with nodes for about two years participating in testnets and validating i came here as an enthusiast in that time i have learned a lot and gained experience with linux i think there are more experienced people here any tips on how to do a node disaster recovery i already learned how to do backups but maybe there are more reliable and complicated ways
372828,every node will be different most nodes which require high throughput will use direct connected hardware rather than fault tolerant arrays which makes the disaster recovery process rather more difficult but ultimately having copies of the keys and configurations will be more important than the actual blockchain data which can always be reseeded from the chain
372829,so for node dr work out which data is unique to you and which can be recreatedreseeded as well as calculating the costimplication of downtime is it just missed opportunity are funds at risk through penaltiesslashing etc
372830,thank you for sharing your opinion and experience
372831,developers are you ready for itthats your chance to gain realworld web 30 development experience from the top crypto and web 30 developers come to meet polygon aleo horizon labs and top local technical leaderswho joined forces with the mission of providing you with the best tools for success in crypto web30the event will take place in zoa tlv starting at 12pm till 9pmtwo stages two levels beginners no expiriance required and seniors best practices and advance methods apply todaythe evets sponsors will grant all tickets registration is open till september 1st no tickets sale
372832,happy to invite you all to take part
372833,heh
372834,
372835,its all a wash for as long as and is the norm trying to optimize for people that couldnt care less about crypto means you inevitably optimize for regulations you are what you eat
372836,what about the new guidelines in dealing with cryptocurrencies the focken un issued in june
372837,
372838,hashrate ttd predictions
372839,i feel like i care more about making it hard for the con artists in crypto than my own privacy right now
372840,this week it seems people discovered the usdc freeze function maybe you didnt know but there is also an unfreeze function as well lol i decided to write an article showing the real behemoth usdtwhen comparing what usdc has frozen in the past with usdt its peanutsheres what i wrote about it
372841,lefterisjp isnt this shooting the messenger a bit for institutions wanting to transact with web3 platforms they need some sort of sanctions compliance in place so that if they are prosecuted which definitely happens they can say yes we slipped up but at least we had compliance program in place and used professional expertise to validate the counterparty wallet institutions wont have that skill inhouse and trm provides that servicei felt sick when i heard the news about tc the ramifications seemed obvious to me coming from a compliancelegal background but a part of me accepts that in some ways the tc sanction is another step on the journey towards widespread adoption and even better privacy solutions it gives the industry leverage regulators know the tech will always be one step ahead whackamole and imo tornado cash was never going to be a viable longterm privacy solution
372842,its late here so cant get in a long discussion but a field using such solutions is not a field i want to work inif i wanted to work in traditional finance i would have just gone there 10yrs agoadoption does not mean sacrificing the soul of the space
372843,the turns sure have tabled real hard where the norm is trying to appease institutions lol
372844,id rather have insititions lobby rules that make sense than help them build a perfect panopticum
372845,the situation is similar to chains that have forfeited pow consensus because of 51 attack vulnerability see bch ravencoin etc when under real threat they have no choice but to abandon pow consensussecurity and use it only as a gimmick for deciding on reward amounts the alternative is to be attacked and completely destroyed
372846,there are actionable decisions to be made either accept defi as a blockchainsettled improvement over tradfi or go all in and try to create something really decentralized the second one is going to require some physical relocation at the very least
372847,well written usdt kind of too big to fail now the exchanges are dominant users as most stable coin pairs are using usdt
372848,imho it seems there nothing is too big to fail in crypto usdt is merely x3 from ust on its top
372849,thats true actually usdt has better liquidity comparing with ust under extreme cases usdt users can exit through exchanges ust were mainly rely on liquidity providers curve and others
372850,usdt has also blocked infinitely more hacked funds compared to usdc which has blocked none
372851,usdt will also get you your funds back if sent to a smart contract that has no ability to move erc20s usdc wont
372852,also weve seen what happens when people try bank run usdt for 10b it survived
372853,you mean one that on the address of usdt itself
372854,i mean if you get usdc locked in usdt contract or any other its gone
372855,if you do the same with usdt theyll print you some more to replace it
372856,who do you contact about this
372857,i once accidentally sent 30k
372858,this contract has 30k usdc for example half of it is mine or should have been
372859,tether team will help you out for a 10 percent fee
372860,that is fine with me
372861,do you have a contact
372862,im sure it is
372863,nope just google their policy
372864,you can submit a request
372865,cool thanks
372866,feel like my losing usdc and finding out usdt can refund you may be net positive in the end for everyone else that actually gets their usdt back
372867,dont do that we even made a tool for it works for usdt and any other erc20 token
372868,we dont do it on purpose
372869,but nice was thinking about something like this makes sense for it to exist
372870,i think it needs to get integrated into something like metamask to go mainstream and have trust
372871,on another note wallets should really warn you if youre sending money to a smart contract or an empty address
372872,or an address that looks like it cant move erc20s
372873,im very happy i just made my first withdrawal after i was scammed here all thanks to your team i will introduce this to my colleagues thanks again
372874,the first here simple and straightforward
372875,
372876,has anyone used metamask snap btw wondering if all these metamask fixes are possible with it and if theyll eventually accept the changes to core if community adds them
372877,im saying metamask should do what you suggested
372878,last time i tweeted them they should make set approve all way more clear the update came a week later but that likely wasnt because of me
372879,should be trivial to check the recipient is a smart contract granted there will false negatives because ethereum quirks but it should cover the 999999
372880,multisigs
372881,yes one such quirk
372882,but they can probably check that too as long as they give a warning user can always still decide to do it if theyre certain
372883,another fatal one being the idea to turn all accounts into smart contracts without providing a way to distinguish between humans and smart contracts
372884,they should also have a way to report addresses similar to google if youre on a phishing site
372885,what do you mean who is turning all addresses into contracts
372886,look up account abstraction eips
372887,in any case would always be able to check if it has the transfer erc20 capability
372888,ethereum heres one
372889,unless im missing something theres no way to tell
372890,cool vaguely remember from a while ago
372891,you can check if it has certain methods if it conforms to an interface
372892,but thats on the token
372893,a smart contract can transfer tokens out via a 3rdparty contract based on a preset approval another can do it via a literal transfer function on it or a withdraw function ortheres no generalized can deal with token indicator
372894,you might not cover all cases
372895,but if you gnosis multisigs can then you can check if it matches that for example
372896,has anyone seen the ist paper from agoric looks alot like terra without anchor
372897,or maker with 3 types of collaterisation that hold varying pegs with the dollar
372898,perhaps but at that point it starts to get a lot more thorny than simply getcodeing the recipient
372899,all of that said given current events maybe its a good thing they dont do this would be pretty funny to paste in an address and be met witherror this address has risk your transaction has been rejectedlol
372900,most basic level just warn on any smart contract next level would be to not warn when sending to a known contract type i dont think you need many exceptions here only standard contracts
372901,mutlisigs mayve the only exception basically
372902,dunno i wonder how many people want to be sending anything to a smart contract at least just tell the user its a contract and let them decide even if not looking to scare
372903,nan
372904,also contracts do signal things like if they implement ierc20receivable dont know how reliable it is in practice but you could avoid warning on those potentially
372905,wheres that from cant find it on oz
372906,there is one for nfts erc721 but only just
372907,anyone know the main tornado cash address that you interact with when actually using tornado cash is it this guy
372908,no
372909,to the first or the second question
372910,mine
372911,no to first yes to second
372912,blockscout is the best open source explorer
372913,
372914,fun
372917,dumb question but after the eth fork i guess any weth on chains like matic etc wont get airdropped ethw
372927,i wonder is there a pattern on these videos to just build some sort of a bot
372928,anyone did a study on how much volume this generates and how shillfluencers impact order book and liquidity pools on amms
372929,just a speculation but does anyone think the regulators will come who can trade at what exchanges given their market structure ie would they come for amms because they associate amms with some illicit activity
372930,sorry havent seen the the discussion but im wondering wouldnt the us based persons just move their activities to some sort of swiss bank equivalent of the crypto world
372933,often nonexistent
372934,is here anyone wellversed in lightning and taro i have tried to search an answer to questions1 how does the node manage lusdbtc conversion rate oracles pools2 if node keeps receiving lusd and sending btc how is the node balanced so the node operator doesnt end up just selling their btc for lusd

372938,can someone that has done a raise with a vc or an angel explain to me how one does a realistic pre money calculation ive done research and to my knowledge its just a speculative guess on what the company is valued at now with some market research to back up the valuation would appreciate any inputs sorry if off topic
372939,is there any way receiving larger amount of matic tokens on mumbai testnet
372940,via gainstrade you can get 10000 testnet dai but not sure about matic tokens ask in their discord or tg perhaps
372941,it used to be around multiple of revenue or prospective revenues nowadays you throw a dart and mutliply by a million might have changed a bit with the whole economy go boom thing
372943,usdd ftw
372944,usually the formula is terminal valuerisk discount max fdv if everything goes according to your vision divided by how much the vc needs to make profit on you to offset risk of you and many others failingboth terminal value and risk are extremely subjective predictions so thats why the numbers are random best way is to evaluate yourself based on similar startups and see where you stack up
372945,dutch tornado cash dev has been arrestedeng nl
372946,so now we blame the devs
372947,need to wait for the indictment to know whether this is purely about development activities
372948,any reputable sources
372949,fiod is the government
372950,fiod is the government
372952,got it thanks
372953,he is suspected of involvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering through the mixing of cryptocurrencies through the decentralised ethereum mixing service tornado cashlol
372954,the country has chosen threats of jail over regulation and that is likely to send its digital currency entrepreneurs overseas
372955,so we all go anon now who will make an anon setup git with whonix workstations api keys for registering twitter account github accounts telegram accounts voice changers etc
372956,ah right i seeand ya i feel like no one even uses that anyway
372957,he made money off the money laundering
372960,assumed erc20s had a similar one but i guess nothing standard
372961,these idiots are calling daos advanced technology that facilitates some sort of transaction
372962,ffs it wasnt illegal or sanctioned then so now some govt gets to say this is illegal now and as a dev who wrote a totally legal implementation you are now at risk of imprisonment this is insane
372963,these advanced technologies such as decentralised organisations that may facilitate money laundering are receiving extra attention from the fiodlol
372964,going after daos as well
372965,yeah it is insane but you know how it is here in nl its usually fine until someone starts to make money
372966,eu chief regulators
372967,wen citadel
372968,also they need to kiss usa ass
372969,on regular basis
372970,whats the idea you send the advanced dao technology your dirty money and they send it back to you
372971,i think there could be something lost in translation here from dutch
372972,you mean like cash
372973,dutch police arrest suspected tornado cash developer
372974,
372975,if true this is a turning point nobody will dare to write privacy code or tx mixer in the future
372976,only fiod can do it nobody else monopoly as it is
372977,unless they dare make a pseudonymous account a heretofore unknown act in this space
372978,i dont think its turning point its same as with any black hacking everyone knows they can be caught by police and they will have to work with them after but has it ever stopped other people from hacking
372979,its a precedent and surely will temporarily scare people
372980,the turning point being arresting opensource devs for having written code that someone else may use for a crime
372981,if that turns out to be the reason for the arrest the article is not clear seems to imply other stuff too
372982,yeah no full data on the case it can turn out they arrested him for other reasons and will release when they get needed information
372983,guys do you really think you have the opsec it takes to escape from a government actively looking for you
372984,but likely its what you mentioned someone who used the code for crimeamoney laundering
372985,most people dont hide anything crypto people have opsec for other reasons
372986,if youre going anon to hide from the average joe bagholder then sure but it takes a whole lot of effort to be untraceable if you get sanctioned
372987,opsec isnt just about trace
372988,a bit too late for some to do that lol
372989,id be surprised if this holds up in court might as well arrest every bank employee for facilitating illicit transfers for decades or nation states for printing cash used in drug trades etcmonero atomic swaps fin
372990,in the 90s cryptodevs used to have balls dunno about today
372991,in due time the problem will be for deploying programs on decentralized ethereum technology without receiving proper authorization and implementing necessary checks
372992,yeah thats why they went for the largely extrajudicial tool of sanctions making it as difficult as possible to use the courts to reverse this decision probably because they know itd never hold up at least in the us
372993,heh
372994,not really if the drug war is any indication as long as theres demand for privacy and people willing to pay for it there will be people providing those services
372995,kinda reminds me of the dread pirate robert case vanned for developing a platform too serving a life sentence now
372997,remember liberty reserve the service people use to use to send and receive money a privately before bitcointhe founder was sentenced to 20 years
372998,in the eyes of the law its not just code
372999,even the cto was given the maximum sentence of five years after pleading guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business
373000,operating being the key word here
373001,the us could kill every tornado dev with missile strikes and itd still be there continuing to offer privacy its different than other cases including silk road
373002,the way they can kill it is make it impossible to cash out after tornado which is pretty much what theyre doing
373003,but its unlikely to be 100 effective
373004,people my guess is that it takes time to build the infrastructure to support a blacklist of contractsinfura the infrastructure has always been there anon
373013,buy the nft to spam in kingdom and discuss the fall of western governments jk spam memes
373014,any plans of launching a cheap option for poor plebs
373015,do yoga so you learn to control your impulses
373017,how to check if my addresss is on the tornado cashusdc badboy list
373018,there is no badboy list sanction list are tornado pool contracts
373019,there are because every retard scared dev justified out there goes a mile further to overprotect and bans all interacting addys idk maybe banteg has a tool
373020,that may be true indeed but not sure if these lists are public
373021,so vitalik is being blacklisted from those scared dapp devs now lol
373022,
373023,highly likely yes
373024,any reports from tornado related bans i know uniswap is banning nomad related addresses trm labs just sends them the list i guess and opensea is doing random bans but are those related to tornado
373025,the funniest thing is they all decided to make sanctions retroactive by that logic 99 of us corpos should be banned because they used to do business with russia
373026,does sushi or curve ban usersis there a list somewhere of trm labs partners
373027,uniswap for sure oasisapp partnered today
373028,not sure if there is a list
373029,you dont have to outrun the bear
373030,
373031,tornado discord is deleted
373032,in 2020 i got scammed on uniswap and sent the scam token back to the scammers address because i was unable to resell it once you bought it you couldnt sell it again he used tornado cash to move the eth hope that doesnt connect my address to tornado cash and freeze my usdc
373033,there are so many mentions of tornado in here we are all going to jail
373034,curve does not do this
373035,uno_reverse_cardjpg
373036,so far uniswap opensea suspected work with trm probably more
373039,dear founders i wrote an article about the use of hashtags in crypto and their effects on engagement rates generic hashtags and i would love to get an opinion on the draft the article will be public so i hope it can help crypto marketers for their content strategy any feedback on how to improve my analysis would be highly appreciated
373040,turns out the and friends were listening
373041,tfw getting garyd looks like a good thing
373042,funny enough one of the most popular tweets not using a hashtag is from an aptos wallet lol
373043,does anyone have a good resource for onchain privacy solutions with proscons couple things come to mind but certainly would like more indepth knowledge via cex not really private because kyc but at least severs direct link onchain between two wallets via bridge many bridges allow you to bridgeandtransferto via dex ie uniswaps swapandtransferto railgun aztec what else exists
373044,you want an overview of live protocols or underlying technologies
373045,
373046,really about what an enduser can do to retain some degree of privacy onchain ie changing to a fresh new wallet once per year
373047,sers regarding the tc developer is there anywhere that actually specifies he was arrested for the fact of building tc rather than doing some illegal shit
373048,current consensus in gov seems to be that you are from north korea if you even ask that question
373049,the literal fiod post
373051,yes pardon ser i come from great peoples republic of korea and contrary to inferior western systems we do value onchain privacy highly
373052,we generously offer asylum to all tornado cash developers
373056,ok this is just flood spam at this point buy the nft to spam in kingdom
373057,enough was discussed and shared circles r no fun peace
373058,yes exactly lets wait to see how it develops but damn
373059,is it now the replacement for the dove metricsanything better exists
373060,mvp of something im cooking
373061,sushi maintains an ofac list check only addresses that are published by them tho it does not add additional addresses
373062,that is completely different what legal use case was there for silk road
373064,scbuergelreplying to 0xjjpa infura_io and 2 othersa friend of mine just tested sending a tx via etherscan to a listed address via a custom infura endpoint and received this
373067,this is circular everybody gets the argument stop with blabla redacted
373068,well this is serious
373069,ofac is the nuclear weapon of finance no one will touch anything related to blacklisted entity
373070,cool opportunity dropped in the degenscore cafe if you like perpetual swaps and want to try out the arbitrum ecosystem next week lmk if you have any questions this is alpha
373071,jfc stfu if you dont know anything
373072,literally is not
373073,thanks for the insightful and respectful answer i was answering to the news about discord if you say it literally is not then apparently i dont know anything about the subject and i should shut my mouth got it
373074,hi sers not sure if asked already but is there any way to batch different contract calls in one transaction without creating a contract with a js library or similar
373075,multicall does this
373076,
373077,also does this
373078,you just saved me hours of coding ser thanks
373079,there are at least 3 different versions fyi
373080,rofl
373081,oxmikko van0k share
373082,guys websockets still gud
373083,intern not anymore
373084,hi fellow lobsters hopefully you guys and ivan wont mind a bit of defi saver fyi quite a lot of crazy stuff these days but were focused on buidling soafter launching on arbitrum and optimism over a month ago our flagship automation service is now officially live on both leading l2 chains you can now make us of the service with a lot smaller positions than on the mainnet automate positions with just 500 minimum debt requirement keep your positions safe from liquidation now with 20x lower tx fees on l2sarbitrum automation went live this week heres the announcement optimism automation is live for a few weeks cool thing about it is that theres an ongoing liquidity mining campaign there for aave v3 as most of you probably know
373085,when lobsterdao super pac
373086,cool how does the product make money
373087,hi elie we have a sustainable feebased business model we wanted to keep things simple by introducing only a 025 service fee on all complex actions that include a token swap within the transaction for standard basic interactions available in official protocol dashboards for example aave maker and liquity like addwithdrawborrowpayback we take no service fees advanced protocol interactions that we created like 1tx deleveraging boost repay creating and closing leveraged positions have a 025 service fee of the swapped amount for automated positions we charge 03 on automated adjustments and thats it basically
373089,cool has it been driving good revenue so far or still early days
373090,if u dont know defisaver idk
373091,hmm well you can check out joel johns analysis to get a picture of it better
373092,
373093,i dont lol i guess anything outside of nfts got little clue lol
373094,cool exactly what i was after so looks like you have legit token terminal revenue feel like the author is off about gem and uniswap revenue both still on 0
373095,
373096,kid just got out soon back in muh hacked and selling now
373097,
373098,nightmare fuel
373099,ur seed phrase stays the same whats the point
373100,u go propagate the tx somehow else
373102,the point is the same one as consensys nuking your ability to use infura to interact with tcash contracts despite the ability to use another service
373103,as long as you have the seed you can always find a way around you can just import a ledger seed in metamask or not
373104,ye i also didnt get it emilianobonassi
373105,the existence of alternatives is completely immaterial the point is compliance
373106,well lets seemetamask is owned by consensys consensys owns mycrypto too if you dont know what consensys is theyre the company that owns infura
373107,yes you can do this can also change your rpc url within metamask
373108,but you can change the rpc right
373109,i hope i dont need to explain the problem there so you move to another optioncoinbase wallet perhaps you should probably read the first name there and think againso another wallet maybe trust wallet good news binance owns trust wallet
373110,rabby
373111,owned by debank i think
373112,ya think debank fancies such a fight when they have their bottom line to worry about
373113,you are saying metamask will eventually be able to remove custom rpc feature
373114,because that is what this is all about if im right
373115,you can initate transactions in geth directly doesnt help with the hardware wallet though
373116,what do you mean
373117,metamask is proprietary software consensys can do whatever they want with it
373118,technically u can create your own wallet
373119,metamask is like the front uiux
373120,time to launch a coding bootcamp lol
373121,were talking about an rpc banning certain interactions on chain like infura did with tornado changing to another rpc still allows those transactions
373122,learn to code
373123,run your own node
373124,soon cli wallets would be the only option
373125,from what i understand from above cant you just rewrite another contract
373126,would it be possible for validators to reject certain transactions would be a whole different problem then lol
373127,there are so many validators
373128,of course they can youd hope them being so many would prevent that though
373129,thought metamask was open source no
373130,so treasury saying its now illegal to validate tx containing xxx would be a great start lol
373131,fun prospects in the future with poseth having coinbase kraken and lido be the supermajority stake
373132,im pretty sure there are backend validators available its already used for faster network transactions specifically for nfts
373133,
373134,good read thanks
373135,this is gonna be a dumb question but if there was a service that would prevent you from interacting with a non known contract address say to prevent the curve dns hack would this apply to the rpc or wallet level
373136,antoniomjulianothis week an important technology was sanctionedtoday a developer of open source software was arrested for the contents of that softwarethis is it this is the line we need to all take a stand that this should be an illegal attack on freedom
373137,he is not wrong though but i dont see him proposing anything
373138,not really besides so we all need to publicly take a stand today as leaders and the entire crypto community to say this is too far
373139,kinda toothless considering hes already complying
373140,as he should because well whos itching to be insert martyr to reference 20
373141,isnt dydx banning tornado also
373142,well the tornado guys are already the involuntary martyrs all we can do is support them in any way possible
373143,thats part of the process to find a way to legally work and not for all devs to be afraid to go to jail
373144,youd hope not holding my breath given this space is renowned for its ability to just move on
373145,
373146,its not like we need to storm the streets or something a few wealthy benefactors are more than enough to cover the ensuing legal battle
373147,
373148,the rest of us should push for decentralizing everything in the meantime
373149,no incentive how many people do you think are affected by dirty tornado cash
373150,only way anything changes is if theres existential threat to ethereum as a result of this else this is going to be old news by the time the merge rolls around maybe you get a few updates in insert publication once a month and poor devs in a couple chats
373151,i can guarantee you that the other devs will remember this anyway tornado is ofc a special snowflake and every other defi protocol literally cannot be used for money laundering but this sets a very poor precedent for inevitable attempts at a generalized crackdown later
373152,oh im sure the devs will care or somebody will make them care when its too late lol i certainly care you better care
373153,the message is simple compliance will be rewarded defiance will be tolerated but for a time defi is dead long live comfi hyperbole maybe hopefully
373154,
373155,would customer service actually give out this info
373156,doesnt matter incentive alignment is a killer thing will just end up cartelizing the space if they try to criminalize it prohibition is a fantastic example normally alcohol manufacturing is a fairly dull business but outlaw it and suddenly every still is protected by a dozen men with automatic weapons
373157,i think defi will turn from regulatory arbitrage wild west to a boring fintech backend
373159,is here k
373160,if theres money to be made and there is demand for a product or service driving it underground just leads a game of cat and mouse that ultimately explodes into the mainstream at some point and puts your entire apparatus to ruin and hostiletakeover the printing press is a good example once again when certain books were banned early printers found that they made more money by printing those books the money was a stronger incentive than the fear of reprisals and rich printers could pay for protection in jurisdictions that were outside central control
373161,quick question where was all this outrage when this happenedor thisthis has been happening constantly for years its not like this is some sort of new idea that the feds arrest the creators of mixers
373162,privacy is not a problem for the government we are getting it all wrong
373163,its about how we provide it
373165,they never tried to arrest eg wasabi devs for introducing coinjoin to their wallet
373166,im just saying this isnt exactly an unpredictable or unprecedented outcome
373167,yeah theres precedence the difference is those were businesses operated by people not indifferent smart contracts
373168,metacoin is right on this one banningarresting creators of a mixer is still different than arresting the founder of an a16z backed startup its one step further than banning actual operators of mixers but no reason to say theres suddenly open season on defi devs
373169,so thats good means theres time to fight this one and nip this hamfisted approach in the bud
373171,the flaw in this analogy is your target market is quite content with comfi dare i say the vast majority of the market couldnt care less about this tornado event because i haz nuffin to hide
373173,comfi doesnt feel so comfy lobs but this is the case and i have a feeling compliancy is going to be the next narrative and especially supported as the more institutional types enter into the picture
373177,i disagree most of europe was totally fine with books being banned but enough people were involved in that counterculture that the reformation ended up being a thing just a matter of criticalmass and ultimately an appeal to the masses were still early days and the pressure they exert against us is likely to increase significantly over time
373178,the narrative of banks bad is one that has seeped very aggressively into western culture for the past decade or two so painting defi at the fulcrum of a populist coalition of antiestablishment right and left wingers wont be a hard sell
373179,heh that sort of thinking doesnt even have critical mass within crypto itself what once existed is continually eroded with every other compliant vcfunded startup
373180,
373181,im not sure comparing the conditions of most of europe during those days to now is anywhere near the same thing id go as far as saying most of europe did not have access to these books and had substantially more problems to worry about during that time as for banks bad this isnt without good reason many people were burned pretty hard in previous recessions which caused a huge panic people havent forgotten the bail outs banks got for their mistakes though there is something to be said for the messaging being pushed it started becoming concerning when crypto is about xyz feel good thing i believe in was the message being sent and things like right to privacy were hand waived away in that messaging
373182,he keeps losing no he got fucked by btc by tesla by everything i thought so
373183,yes and the first use of the printing press itself was to print indulgences the short time horizon of the culture around a technology ultimately doesnt matter when the technological space itself is fundamentally corrosive to the sorts of power structures that people are currently seeking to translate from cefi
373184,that is to say what can be done will be done and what can be done funamentally undermines the compliance relationships of the past threehundred years
373185,if youre talking about gutenberg printing press the first use was printing the bible
373186,it now seems possible that gutenberg printed indulgences as early as 1452 at the request of nicolaus cusanus the prominent german cardinal a very early connection between printing and the bureaucratic needs of the churchso yes the very first use was the bible but the second was working for the establishment of the times
373187,im addressing this the first use of the printing press itself was to print indulgences
373188,anyway i dont want to get too off topic because not kingdometc and i can ramble on about this topic as well as a few others related to it of that era all day d
373189,yes kingdom is perfect for this please buy a lobster and come discuss
373190,ok ok im finally sold on it it can be any lobster or a special type
373191,can i buy a lobster with eth pow
373192,you can buy a lob_pow
373193,yes and yes
373194,cheapest ugliest lobster from sudo floor would even suffice
373195,sorry guys for the videomy tweet is provocativeyou are correct ivan et al if you own the seed you can restore wherever you wantmy point is to stimulate thinking how many things we give for ok i have control and am i sure what this tool is doingsaid that willing to know hw opensource wallet
373196,
373200,ah probably because the t part my bad
373201,notice to all investors this platform is a business platform its aim is solely to help people from all round the world make good profits we do not entertain any chats or discussions which do not gear towards uplifting ones financial status please stick to the platform instructions to avoid being ignored when you contact make your chats brief and straight to the point because there are lots of people here who also chat us daily for business
373202,so poweth is a chance to rebuild a fully decentralized ecosystem that rids itself of the poison pill of usdc
373203,who is building for it
373204,grifters noone wants your angel investment ser
373205,lol
373206,lol
373207,change my mind
373208,attacks on centralized aspects result in builders decentralizing those weaknesses
373209,these attacks will make evm stronger
373210,if youre going to arrest creators of tools then you should arrest gun company ceos for murder what bothers me is that 90 of scammed money goes thru binance they prob have worlds largest database of criminal activity names addresses phone numbers and no one is arresting them
373211,and more censorship resistant
373212,alright before ivan come in here pissed if you didnt ctrlf before starting a new ethpow poweth discussion on this group i hope you have a lobster nft for ban protection
373213,hah ivan wheres muh lobstah
373214,you are right i missed any previous convo
373215,wait a minute i thought we were 20k members now down badly to 196k what happened did i miss something
373217,probably bots in and out
373218,
373219,lets leave it at this
373220,ok i will be contrarian on the twitter then
373223,what the hell so ofacgeth is not a joke
373224,flashbots has a pr to disallow transactions to and fr ofac list
373225,considering that 80 of nodes are running mevgeth its close enough to ofacgeth
373226,a year ago it would have been a joke but now nottheonion
373227,oh wait i think its the relayer that has the pr
373228,not the geth
373229,like geth developers are not on ef payroll while residing in the west
373230,besides bots actually most crypto chats are down bera i guess
373231,
373233,by the way idk if it is related or not but in marchmay i did a research for them for free just as a lobster dao chat user and spotted that some relayers are abusing another ones to antiviruses and make people chose another relayer idk what to do with this informationive made a thread
373234,a twitter space was shared just here
373235,why would one be moderated and the other not genuinely wondering
373236,and here altenative space with developers about how does tornado cash work and technical ascept of blocking
373237,1 those guys have a bit more experience w privacy as they been working in it2 the speakers you outlined dont seem to be directly privacy related unless they r so good at privacy they hid it ggno disrepsect at all just tried to filter based on available info so we would not die from countless spaces altho urs is cool too blz proceed keep it
373238,we have to be prepared for a threefold fork 1 ofaceth2 ethw3 nofaceth
373241,this is not true
373242,the relay has the code to block and filter
373243,you can see this code in the old relay the nodejs version this is used on goerli the current relay is closed source they say they open source it in sept
373244,yeah that was the next message when i typed it it was one after another but seems like eventually my message came after a new one
373245,also you can always remove the code my guy hell we dont even run flashbots mevgeth we use different build entirely as flashbots has removed features retroactively before eth_callbundle as an example
373248,well ofcourse but again most of the network is going thru their relayer which i guess is a different discussion if having a relayer like that makes the system inherently centralized
373249,what are the best dov projects that have better mechanism and better vaults performance
373250,is there a way to map a token across all the place you can borrow it
373251,thank you for clarifying ivan i try to bring experts and people passionate about their field every week to walk us through some specific topics in cryptoone time i had a macro economist with tons of experience and it was very fun
373252,btw collar ratio went up 10 and wbtc part changed from 37 to 41 was it just price flucation or makers is starting to implement usdc hedge to wbtc
373253,
373254,its all going to zero lol
373255,trm labs hate on
373256,more impotent rage
373257,tomorrow everyone will blink and keep on as if nothing happened
373258,comfi ftw
373259,so dai is basically 15 crypto collateralized stable now
373260,i assume etherscan will soon start sending this data for direct contract calls and then what at this point defi and nfts become too difficult for an average bayc bullish
373261,the transaction is sent through whatever rpc youre connected with your wallet nothing to do with etherscan
373262,they could still block people from viewing the website tho
373263,yeah i didnt mean theyd block transactions just make all common front ends unusable for the general public
373264,for quite a while actually for newcomers guni tokens are liquidity pools that are connected to usdc by common liquidity pairs so circle co have quite a lot of power to render dai useless in an instant counterintuitively so if you have lets say 10k usdc on your wallet the probability that your particular wallet out of millions of other wallets will be frozen might be perceived as lesser than the probability of freezing single collateral of makerdao but thats merely a current state of dai not a design limit so they can change it in theory
373265,yeah but i see people will start forking the official uis strip the blacklist and open it for the users like dydx did
373266,and now aave
373267,thats still path to a huge cleansing imo almost like torrents and their popularity that never really became mainstream once its blocked most average joes wont bother looking for mirrors anyway not really debating cause its probably boring
373268,woah they really hitting hard this timenight of the long pull requests innit
373269,probably shouldve taken a hint when they introduced kyc after cozying with institutions but onwards
373270,yes
373271,using trm labs too
373272,curious what activities
373273,probably touched tornado
373274,wonder how that vote went
373275,dont know this purse justin sun
373276,trm has various risk profiles probably aave can tweak it a bit to set it to max risk and not blanket catch people 12 hops of tornado seems like this is what dydx did
373277,youre saying everyone who touched tornado are currently blacklisted by virtually all of major defi seems like a stretch
373278,i am going further d
373279,even addies few hops away were banned with dydx
373280,aave is interesting the webapp is hosted on ipfs so its decentralized i wouldnt think theyd have to be as concerned with trms list
373281,but dydx adjusted the risk profile and fixed it
373282,already chainalsis was rating as high risk
373283,yeah but they said it was a mistake basically
373284,tornado was on ipfs too
373285,anyway gotta tornado some and check for myself ig
373286,they are all using the same centralized risk assesment service
373287,
373288,tornado was also specifically sanctioned addresses that touched tornado preaction were not
373289,very different risk profiles
373290,get token away from the governance
373291,in theory in practice compliance will be rewarded are you ready to comply
373292,i know understand trm just wondering if protocols are actually already enforcing what you said
373293,im pretty certain giving personally identifiable information to 3rdparties is the opposite of a solution to this problem let me rephrase that if you are government such a scheme is the best trojan horse you could ask for even more desirable than the big red button power fiatcoins provide
373294,seems we got many different ones starting to do so this week
373295,for aave here is the proof in github
373296,yeah we gotta see how it works in practice ie if anyones addresses on here are actually blacklisted for merely using tc or not
373297,if trm had a token it ought to be breaking aths lol
373298,doesnt matter really
373299,a flip of a buitton can change the risk assesment and ban every lobster holder
373301,encrypt 1 pii of your body if provably irreversible why should not that work
373302,its hard for me to take that question seriously
373303,this is totally true i believe it takes being in an amazing community to pull that off
373304,most of the things ive learned on this space are from rich communities actually
373305,thats very true i think being in the best community can be life changing
373306,especially consistently active ones
373307,exactly why i love it here
373308,adlunam have been consistent with their week twitter spaces every tuesday and thursday
373309,i think itll be a great move partnering with them
373310,great partnerships are always helpful
373311,i always look forward to such
373312,bots 20
373313,i remember people were shilling this as a better and more decentralized alternative to infura
373314,ooof
373315,i think we need to support some sort of canceldao to keep remembering this cases of false promises and spread awareness of web3 project limitations like but for one who betray the decentralization movement what do you say
373316,nice
373317,what what i understood the only advantage of pokt over infura was ability to just work decentralized ie vitaliks phial of galadriel from
373318,to stay in compliance the pocket portal will be blocking interaction with a number of addresses the connection between pni and the pocket portal means that any activity involving the portal is absolutely required to be in compliance with us regulations wasnt it a lie to investors
373319,it was not a bad idea but this kills it
373320,they need to ger rid of this centralized portal otherwise it makes no sense
373321,mind you the graph protocol has the exact same centralized payment portal in their decentralized subgraph network
373322,they claim they are still doing rnd on v1 which will not have a portal
373323,
373324,the sec wishes they were this effective lol
373325,then metamask will implement kyc verification unfortunately it was predictable 1year ago after uniswap banned some derivatives tokens
373326,wen oracles banned because they facilitate the creation of illegal derivatives platforms
373327,can uniswap v3 ban builtin twap oracle
373328,meh thats already onchain was thinking more about usapi3 chainlink band and others
373329,i mean when everything is so fked up and you need a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out uni_v3 twap is better than nothing but is it really can uniswap still break it somehow chainlink in controlled by just a multisig afaik
373330,i mean they just randomly declared the usage of a contract illegal yeah chainlink can potentially be forced through a multisig but if theyre going that path no oracle would be safe they can always ban usage of any other oracle smart contract kek kinda important that this gets fought or well see more random bans on smart contracts because they facilitate illegal stuff
373331,uniswap is invulnerable to that
373332,unfortunarely this doesnt work that way use smartcontract as we tell you blockchain is either censorship resistant or there are some entitiespeople who can censor usage of it same with blochcain primitives such as dexes oracles infra like rpc ipfs gateways etc
373333,i mean in theory chainlink can simply be made to blacklist contracts on something like tellor it gets more complicated because anybody can report prices permissionlessly when they have enough tokens staked but tbh a simple ban there would be that addresses that eg supply price data to derivatives exchanges get flagged will probably have the same effect as the tc ban and people will stop answering to those specific price requests looks very bleak tbh
373334,btw um whats the excuse going to be when these willingly compliant are going to be asked to go just a step further into the comfi embrace and add amlkyc cant pull the we cant do that card unless youre uniswap
373335,i wish makerdao would just open their oracles it would cost them zero but the whole ecosystem would benefit isnt it like dog in the manger situation
373336,that solves nothing tho
373337,arent these controller by their dao i didnt dig in details of their osm in details since its not possible to use it
373338,many ways to shut oracles off tbh thats the scary part the only save haven truly would be uniswap
373339,could you elaborate the way how one can shutdown makerdao oracle
373340,also it seems your company is doing something about oracles
373341,were also fucked
373342,anything thats not natively onchain would be fucked
373343,ban the usage of the contracts a la tc go after the data sources that supply them with data and force them to revoke access target individual dao members that run the oracle unit pretty public proposal after all
373344,thanks for your honesty
373345,1 data source is never a problem data providers can just find new one2 target dao members as i understand it doesnt matter where the settelment leyer is it can be on network consensus it can be smartcontract dao consensus in both this cases it be mitigated by using tortornada
373346,what does 2 mean
373347,target individual dao members that run the oracle unit pretty public proposal after all imagine that price oracles works as dao members can commit price and result calcs as their stake consensus focal point with reward etc the concern that bad actors can come after the dao members who commit the prices and compromise enough of them to render oracle useless i argue that internet access via tor and wallet owenershipfunding via tornado should mitigate this issue a few year ago i had some thought on that page 9 wp is long deprecated dont use it shouldnt be still true today
373348,although it seems there should be far simplier solution chainlink just move from multisig to proper onchain dao
373349,well for one dao members here is rune christensen and a handful of american vcs a16z being quite the favorite do you think any of those people entities are itching to use tornado after the sanction
373350,if dao decides differently so let it be i think were talking here about the case there community clearly doesnt want to be cencored but external forces use limitation of technology and centralizations to make it so
373351,the community can want whatever it wants but when the reality is such that youve built what is effectively a backdoor into your system reality takes precedence over your desires just about every project tripping over themselves at the moment to phone trm labs for a contract has a dao those updates are still happening
373352,as stated
373353,reading between the lines here but i d expect metamask to start to more actively flag addresses for better or worsea bit worried they consider fighting phishing is the first thing they can do to help privacy not very cypherpunkey of them
373354,they will unfortunately and as well implement a kyc and aml by law for every interaction users have with identification is needed i dont think defi will have an exception in this regards
373355,you can use sourceify
373356,its like etherscan except contracts are stores in ipfs and its maintained by the ef
373357,just use layerzero generalized abstract messaging for cross chain no token needed
373358,postmerge it is possible to penalize validators who skip ofacsanctioned blocks
373359,
373360,not directly i believe
373362,but i suppose they could be penalized if theyre not active on the canonical chain
373364,huh
373365,
373366,sounds like project proactively block above and beyond legally required
373367,thanks to all those fighting the good fight godspeed
373368,its now overcomply with selfinvented sanctions and see what happens or let it ride and see what happens
373369,ctrlf its sad and all discussed all of the above already fin
373370,just a reminder that defisaver a serbian based defiprotocol exist it will allow u to manage most big lending protocols from their app they dont need to be ofac compliant
373371,
373372,increase sc risks but reduce regulatory risks kinda
373373,why can we not have an on chain dataset of prices that can update with every swap that happens on chain would that not be immutable as there would be no human interaction to go after
373374,because thats about a trillion dollars worth of gas a day if you want all the calculations and updates onchain
373375,makes has their onchain oracles for example which are very expensive
373376,zero knowledge not an acceptable solution theres got to be a way
373377,well the ok lets make all this new tech now come together and be usable that solves all human problems is a solution but it does not exist or not even close yet it seems
373378,also how will zk make this cheaper
373379,god chris blec was right its over
373380,anyway feels like a rhetoric mental masturbation convo it defeats any known variables so we are just pointing into the sky nah
373381,damn
373382,can someone recommend tools for portfolio tracking across 100s of wallets
373383,looking for this too
373384,i swear i saw something like this on github from olympus dev but for the life of me i cant find
373386,
373387,is this it
373388,cheer up old chaps can defeat this sorta stuff trivially just need some tests and make sure it doesnt loose money ya
373389,make sure it doesnt loose moneyhah classic
373390,this is the wallet connect impersonator made into chrome extension
373391,impersonate any wallet via walletconnect that should provide the cover for connecting wip via metamask
373392,tho at cursory examination not all frontends implement trm the same way let alone provide the same status code for enabled address oasis being the most egregious dapp then aave then balanceruniswap going off of bantegs public shame list
373393,oasis makes you sign a message and uses that to create an identity so this wont work on their dapp as easily as aave or the rest which just fetch the address of the connected web3 provider wallet
373394,luckily web3 standards are virtually non existent wrt handing multiple wallet connections at once
373395,what would be very interesting is potentially doing a data request inquiry to trm under californias ccpa as they are hq in that state seeing exactly what they collect etc etc
373396,please do
373397,aave seems most aggressive as that one flagged one of my wallets rest i can use still with that wallet
373398,this is what they check at uniswap
373399,what is exactly the definition of linked addresses to tornado cash by aave
373400,got dusted 3 days ago with tc
373401,ahh those 01 eth addresses
373402,yes
373403,cant believe that actually worked
373404,
373405,i did this once before with metamask
373406,feels like this strongly undermines their narrative for gho as well selfsovereign unless aave decides to block you isnt particularly self sovereign
373407,ahhhh these takes again i dont wanna delete to not censor but there is a distinction between interfaces that are regulated in nature and opensource smart contracts accessible through any ui please ctrlf we had this convo 10 times over the past few days
373408,yeah fair enough i was more concerned how it impacts the launch of gho since ive been pretty psyched about it completely agree from a practical perspective but narrative marketing wise most people wont understand the nouance and i was really hoping the ecosystem would switch to a more decentralized stable and thought gho had a good shot at it
373410,already here no worries if you double post sers but dont be alarmed if admins remove doubleposted messages issa not crime we hope
373415,
373418,nothing surprising about this really
373419,still surprises me people simply suffer this bullshit from binance
373421,who reminds that tornado started blocking ofc addresses a few months ago
373422,so what happens now if someone sends to top 50 lps 01 aave uni bal would they freeze funds or just ui
373423,ofc ui contract scant freeze ser
373425,the aave protocol contracts doesnt have any capability like that and should never
373426,then points of access like the ui on ipfs redirected from appaavecom are different story
373427,could be introduced via an upgrade via governance though presumably
373428,
373429,not sure if this is a long shot or a stupid question but are you guys aware where websites like dove metrics before acquired crunchbase crypto weekly etc get their information regarding vc funding some say theyre all hand pickedi assume theyre getting information from certain news sources that cover crypto funding whom have connections to the vcs and then run scripts on said news source that automatically can add that to their site and have an employee review it this is my guess does anyone else have a better one or know the answer
373430,but probably there is something wrong because doesnt sound rational to block cases like the dust transfers ofc i dont really know first hand about that as i have no big access to the aave ui repo or any api
373431,there could be models yes the issue at the end is having some kind of trustable point of info for which ipfs deployment is legit
373432,lmaoo this guy gets more hilarious with each passing day
373433,they also contact startups to confirm info enrich it
373434,yea that makes sense i just wonder where the original information comes from
373439,are any of the upcomming zkrollups working on generalised private transactions
373440,good try fed
373441,send them 01 eth and find out
373442,not a rollup but railgun is building privacy infra that uses zksnarks to allow private txs by way of 0zk addresses in onchain dark pools this means arbitrary smart contract calls against a private balance without the need of rollups l2 etc
373443,this is awesome
373444,the thing is all these types of systems are stop gaps imho privacy should be the standard most people dont care untill they need to if you had to opt in to revealing info it would be game over
373445,privacy by default wont win out with eth as l1
373446,its all stopgaps at that point
373447,100 it has to be a l2 thing
373448,but thats where most end users will be at the end of the day
373449,hence my original question scroll and polygon are not working on this to the best of my knowledge
373450,
373451,i wrote some dumb shit but hopefully not too dumb
373452,im not allowed to tell you who is because ivan will ban me
373454,please ctrlf for this stuff because polygon has some zk stuff aztec etc
373455,yeah thats not generalizable privacy can i share or no
373456,since railgun is sharing i them im gonna share this which is not a secret shill but an explanation of the problem of secure compute
373458,its a 3 part series so this is just a start but it explains why what we all want is so friggin hard to actually do as an l2 or even as an l1
373459,
373460,god fuck me in the ass 7th time it is being sent fine keep it just let it stop
373461,hey guys just found i can not transfer usdc on op chain via metamask looks nobody in twitter mentioned thisanybody knows what happened
373462,my friend tried and does not work either
373463,weird take to correlate hiding traces to some political ideology as if it would only ever be beneficial to utopian antistatists and to imply obedience is somehow a requirement for being able to purchase a house
373464,obviously hiding traces from regulators is what i mean which is a dumb idea by itself
373465,and yes when you buy a house u kinda need a notary or have fiat or smth realworld so that implies to hiding things
373466,emmar accepts bitcoin
373468,thesis about permissionless smartcontracts works only until ofacgeth is here
373469,ye i noted it at the end when that falls is fucked
373470,one of the rare places where you can get banking realworld assets for now as always as a jurisdiction grows it succumbs to the general rules
373471,and its already getting harder there anyway for those from russia for example normal people just normal workers
373472,yep the whole tornado ofac fiasco is incredibly bearish for ethereum long termand competitors arent immune to this either who would want to store anything in smart contract platforms when it could be censored on a finger snap
373473,so back to banks unironically
373474,we already have defacto banks onchain right now
373475,im curious what is everyones course of action me personally im withdrawing half to irl although i hate it
373476,but this is so true i even feel less safe in usdc than a bank acc tbh i hope its just a passing fud that we will forget in a couple of months
373477,easy to say from within the realms of a comfy chair in a somewhat peaceful western nation but this isnt everyones reality unless you want to argue govs are to be trusted at all times by definition its a bit of an ivory tower take
373478,tbh im scared that people will forget in a few months
373479,ah you mean from the pov of less comfy states well ye my comment didnt apply to that mostly was referring to us regulators
373480,months youre optimistic
373481,order one merge and all this is old news
373482,sad but probably true
373483,i wonder if this could be built into browser wallets they could verify a checksum that a frontend is an exact mirror of appaavecom
373484,i think his suggestion was to do something with enough consequences that the market doesnt forget this in 2 weeks andor the absurdity of the sanction is plain for even the regulators to seeas it stands id say the sanction has been even more successful than they probably anticipated dapps that used to defy the sec are now tripping over themselves to comply what excuse are they going to give when theyre asked to implement amlkyc no need to pretend they cant do that only uniswap can pull this pretty much every other dapp is updatable the already dubious plausible deniability of hurr durr we dao cant do anything is almost certainly dead at this pointbut like you said devs are not willing to go to jail they shouldnt be a million sorrys wont make the realities of jail time easier lolsooo can dev community do something
373485,you dont need to be a dev to be a builder
373486,it could have been an onchain blacklist through upgradable sc tho
373487,that is not in the thread too scroll
373488,missed the point then did not follow too close just stunned but you actually mentioned scvalidatorsonchain sanctioning
373489,i cant even send eth not sure why the button is inactive
373490,metamask issue
373491,rollback the metamask version
373492,ok thx dont use op enough to justify too lazy atm
373493,less tweets next time pls
373494,restart ur computer
373495,i came across this the other day when i was using brave it worked when i switched browsers to firefox
373496,ye i am using brave that may be the issue indeed
373497,metamask on brave has so many silly bugs but only 005 of desktop pc users use brave browser so i doubt consensys is bothered to fix any of them soon
373498,try the same seedpkey in rabby wallet should work had the same issue
373499,brave always has oddities a large proportion of the ui bugs reported to us are about brave
373500,so its low users and more bugs a bad combo for getting stuff fixed promptly
373501,anyone using build in brave wallet i saw you can add custom rpcs there aswel
373502,iirc the in absolute terms brave has a low number of users but in terms of crypto i think brave has a reasonable share of the cohort
373503,plus the quickest way to get things fixed is tweet about it the ceo is pretty much first line support kek
373504,is it just me or its impossible to add custom rpc to meta mask these days
373505,its you
373506,im pretty active for years and never had any problems with brave fwiw its usually a slow rpc or infura downing problem
373507,the tinfoil hatting is ath
373508,i can add but never connects
373509,brave and firefox
373510,means broken endpoint usually
373512,
373513,use pocket network rpc service
373514,there is a tool you can just switch to it rpclistdotinfo similar to chainlist but baked by decentrilized rpc service not infura
373515,pocket is better than infura and decentralizedcensorship resistant right
373516,i think it is
373517,3 2 1
373518,so can you please explain than this recent statement
373520,yesi know that
373521,why is everything us based i get it us a huge market but its a decentralized space ffs you can serve it from anywhere in the world while staying anon
373522,yet you still insisting that it is decentralized and censorship resistant
373523,portal is one of the ways that host by the team to use pokt
373524,in months before you can just use sdk to visit pokt not relay on portal but there is a number limit about 3000 dapp now it is no space for new dapp
373525,dapp can use sdk to stake and get relay
373526,i will not too criticize about pokt but i think the architecture is designed fine imo
373527,well the dev was arrested from netherlands
373528,us sanctions propagates throughout the whole space
373529,its a little difficult to explain why now dapp can only use the portal for service but i try to make it clear 1in v0 version of pokt protocol is free for dapp but it still needs stking pokt to generate endpoint so team decide give subsidy to demand side so there is a limit bcs its free2pokt is in early stage and the design is decentrilized but not perfect now it will be better wen v1 version
373530,there are also a dao to decide protocols feature and future this declaration is from core team and only include portal and i dont see a propasal that ban tornado on the protocol layer
373531,i am not try to bullish on pokt but just try to figure out the real situation and what happended means
373532,
373533,new drama
373535,velodrome be like
373540,wait you can send gifs here now
373542,yo any hope for etc to get activity going the thought process is eth mining pools have shitload of capital locked in equip so assumign ethpow is a dumponpleb oneday story miners go etc and start actively stimulating developmentcommunitybuildorsetc there
373543,thoughts
373544,typical
373550,lol
373551,haha
373552,ivan will ban soon
373556,supply could not creat demand
373557,i dont wanna get banned by ivan continue ur shitpost on ur own
373566,nan
373568,hence the incentive part
373569,sure if miner pump hard
373570,you have the link to tweet
373571,where can i find the list of banned addresses
373572,ofac ws
373573,dune analytics has a dashboard for it
373574,yes i think etc would gain more traction than new ethpow eventually the course of action would probably be to shift mining power to new pow and and dump the tokens move back to etc because grayscale has a fund for etc antpool is investing 10m in etc
373578,freezeroblocks
373579,anyone got any links regarding onchain evidence of gaba atm
373580,
373581,i guess this but havent seen any threads
373583,here
373584,nan
373585,
373586,im also umm researching this now first thoughts some work needed to adapt contracts higher gas fees compared to eth alternatives eth is pretty far ahead tech wise
373587,this looks like akulas chainspec format except its not akula guess what it is
373588,i wonder where we end up with all this drama tho maybe even etcwhen people discuss unironically how easy censoring pos transactions is
373589,not wrong but context
373590,exactly nick says its actually easier to censor transactions than gabriel initially thought
373591,but its not an issue then anyway
373592,hi
373593,can i bribe you
373594,oh no
373595,ivan
373596,no gabriel understands how easy it is hes talking about something else
373597,my point was if its so easy to censor transactions on pos were doomed
373598,its just as easy as with pow but the thing lexnode is concerned about is the impossibility of plausible deniability because you have to attest blocks or incur the inactivity leak
373599,governments could blanket ban tx from compliant chain starting at block x
373600,just realised you are publishing every version of the app on ipfs thats super nice transparent to the user and i hope more protocols will do this in the future
373601,like if youre building upon the chain which includes sanctioned tx youre violating sanctions
373604,
373605,from whats shown in the tweet any dev thinks this means anything
373606,seems like an unknown account larping for engagement
373607,wuuuuut
373608,you would need a court orderinjunction
373609,there is still a modicum of due process left
373610,but i feel ya
373611,i think it would be the other way around pass such law or delegated regulation even start investigation arrest warrant youre in jail for indefinite amount of time
373612,lets see about this
373613,yes time for intifada 30
373614,or just vote republican the choice is yours
373615,lets be real democrats are the ones pushing this
373616,well im just happy living in the country thats on the receiving side of sanctions
373618,theyre the nwo party but the whole american deep state swamp is complicit and republican party lacks the balls
373619,we dont need balls we need puppets fed by superpac money
373620,but hopefully its not for long since pax americana is in decline
373621,the last thing we want is a politician with their own ideas
373622,but anyway this little pet project of mine shows much promise
373623,what do you expect when your financing your enemy via interest payments
373625,hey very off top sorryany resources to recommend on deepshit web2 vs web3 throughts by some competent indivuduals
373626,like really deep shit proper 3d chess reading material
373627,still dont wanna say what it is
373628,surprised only one person on twitter made a partial guess
373629,what if we apply erigon and akula innovations to the best in class privacy blockchain
373630,i think iron fish as a good theory as layer2 privacy project
373631,layer 2 is bullshit im talking about l1
373632,not evm obviously
373633,if you think tornado was a kind of layer2 too
373634,drug dealers dont use tornado
373635,drug dealers just go straight to cex to cashout
373636,anyway
373637,obvs choice is to link stuff like vitaliks blog or maybe balaji
373638,these ones are already studied sir smth more exotic mb
373639,ringct in your initial screenshot made the answer pretty obvious lol
373640,it doesnt mean anything for many people around here
373641,anyone building selfhosted frontend appstore for dapps with blockscout explorer yet
373642,
373643,would be very interested in doing something like this
373644,confirmed they use hsbc
373645,he was using the funds lev trading and stopped when he blew 50k
373646,sigh
373649,bulletproofs is the hint
373655,what a flashback
373656,muh mimblewimble
373657,historic moment lobster dao abandoning ethereum for monero
373658,monero my guy
373664,grin already had a rust node
373665,and its dead
373666,that isnt entirely fair like ltc uses mw for shielded addresses
373667,see a lot of ppl on twitter condemning the overreaction of protocols i think kinda naive to think that its due to individual decisions and they are unrelated more probably a behind the curtains situation and everyone was explicitly directed to do so knew it was going to happen for days or weeks damage control is definitely prepared
373668,half of the modifications where already well in progress before all this
373669,the other half had it already this event just happened to be observable because of the novel nature
373672,nobodyevery scammer in this space
373673,
373674,there are devs caught in the crosswinds and thats a shame but there are a handful of highprofile projects that are complicit in creating this problem in the name of growth and they deserve all the derision they get
373675,i really really hate that if youve never had money but then did and lost it excuse
373676,just to be clear they are all 15 mins to billionaires and made their choices already too much to lose and not only their money but investors unlikely anybody cares about the defi community and ethics anymore
373677,again its kinda naive to think of them as the same people as when they started out its too big
373678,yeah its weird our story is kinda similar i came pretty late with no background and no money and im sure its the case for most people here lol
373679,and the list of these are things i learned from my bad choices and you should never do the time for you to give advice ended when you decided to scam fuck off
373680,class of 2017 be reading that like
373681,pretty sure losing everything is a rite of passage at this point lol
373682,few notes
373684,
373685,i guy admitting guilt online for theft and fraud via a feelings manifesto shouldnt be giving advice he should have been seeking legal instead lol
373686,nan
373687,nan
373688,nan
373689,who broke etherscan
373690,try checking otterscan as well or twittercomtryethernal
373691,
373692,alternatives
373694,ethplorer still a thing
373696,yn0060 mangrovedaomangrovesolidityworkspacepackagesmangrovesolidity provides mocha pecfae with version 1000 which doesnt satisfy what espendkjsonfilereporter requests can someone help sort out these version issues
373697,yea use pnpm or npm legacy peer deps
373699,dm pls
373700,does anyone know a bot for autoposting messages to telegram chats otc
373701,to insert text and it sent messages to the database of my groups once an hour
373702,so a spambot
373703,
373704,another day another stablecoin
373705,oh lawd
373706,what happened to acala d
373707,nan
373709,tornadocash follows my account thats probably the reason i also shared thematic stuff on them i got 5 confirmations from people who shared thematic stuff on tornado or tagged them are in a shadowban as wellin short feds are crawling twitter for tags and follows and just do massive bans without any investigation
373711,old news at this point
373712,what happened
373713,
373714,holy shit did he drain a lot
373715,actually it seems he isnt selling
373716,still 03
373717,but theres no way for him to get the funds out right
373718,they stopped operations shouldnt be able to
373720,why not just create a new account
373721,
373722,i will but they can shadowban it as well i dont know lol ive put so much time and efforts into it sad
373723,at least will bring this up
373724,similar to a bug found last year where they stopped the chain via a referendum and recovered the funds wonder if thats the same approach theyll take this time
373725,i hope so though an hour with no official updates is worrisome
373726,pretty sure hell have to white hat worst case scenario hes not getting the funds out
373727,there is precedent
373728,
373729,this is sad news though yes but please dont agitate people to retweet some personal posts so on it looks spammy nobody is hunting people for making tweets hope u and lefteris others will be out of shadowban soon
373730,wait i think youre confusing me with banteg lol was just providing context on the tcashrelated shadowbanning
373731,no he just removed my messages as usual its fine
373732,nono i was replying to farm42 _
373733,not as usual overselfpromo is a general rule
373734,self promo ok
373737,why initially smart contracts are not developed on the languges like javascript can someone point the pros and cons of developing smart contract in javascript
373738,i am not a developer but want to know whether it has advantage over established blockchain smart contracts written in solidity
373739,you know solidity is like js if we talk about words
373740,please google first even quora gives ok replies on this topic
373741,js needs special runtimes like v8 harder to make deterministic for one fault plus quite slow due to type systemsome chains have smart contracts in assemblyscript similar to typescript which compile down to wasm
373742,but we cant use all greedy functions from standard languages in this case gas cost will be huge
373743,thanks so writing smart contract directly using javascript is still not so secure and not cost efficient as writing with solidity
373744,you can write it closetodirect in python this compiler called vyper
373745,ah ok thanks
373747,you can write javascript in near which compiles to wasm dotsama will probably support this too at some point considering theyre wasm
373749,good take thread from brantley addressed to noobs like myself
373750,cant wait for more of this
373751,wtf lol
373752,nan
373753,its almost like they will actually create a web3 social platform this time
373754,yes the ui gets published transparently from github actions of course creating any frontend without any centralization point is no trivial task the reality is that at the moment there is no stack allowing a complete decentralization will get better but still
373755,my personal opinion is that people should still be a bit understanding of the challenges of even trying to achieve full decentralization of course there are mistakes and things to improve but there are a lot of teams trying to push more and more on thar direction because is the right thing to do
373756,systems like decentralized governance are a huge endeavour especially in the nontechnical side
373758,chainlinkgod 0xfoobar banteg sassal zachxbt misttrack all are in a shadowban
373759,all good crypto securitythemed ct is in a shadow ban insane
373761,begone ct you shant be missed
373762,mastodonsocial
373763,looks like ausd is starting to repeg pretty impressive if they manage to get it back up so quickly
373764,
373765,why vcs must u fund open source clones but with narcware
373766,or lens protocol
373767,meant to reply to this one
373768,lensterxyz
373769,acala usd depegged after 1billion exploit is this confirmed anywhere as it would be the biggest exploit this year no
373770,ya
373771,overly centralized discord and ct getting hit is a utopian dream of mine come true
373772,its inevitable anyway and more and more of this is what gets us to mass adoption anyway
373773,they halted the chain i think the funds are frozen no official comms yet but they may be fine
373774,no funds bridged out
373777,probably people complain that it blocks everyone besides their ceo whos wallet wad funded through tornado cash
373781,dotsama uses this sovereign token concept but besides that if the chain is halted on time then no ways to bridge out they would probably have alerting systems in place for their collateral factor so id imagine they would have known about it as it happened
373782,huh
373783,if you want to create narcware adware there are plenty of positions in web2 companies that do this already
373784,did anyone say they r not blocked
373785,on twitter been looking to find the message to share a screenshot with yall but cant find it x_x
373786,what the fuck is this weird pleb pitchforking everyone likes privacy but when you have a company dealing with risks for others as an american you might go paranoid and just overblock so you have a personal ens via tornado and then it turned out it is not bueno so you increase risk score of dusted tornado accounts by mistake and you will also get interface blocked but again just interface whats so surprising
373787,not usamaro or anyone per se
373788,just fucking chill and stop spam
373789,you can spam in kingdom and discuss virtue there nothing wrong with it we did it yesterday as it was a hot topic but no need to ramble about it for weeks
373791,ivan go touch some grass
373792,the future of commerce is web3 based do you really not think there will be tracking especially with such open data
373793,scammers and money launderers existed before web3 as well i guess the tornado team should go focus on paper cash instead of writing code if you think a piece of code isnt going to be written because you call it narcware in some telegram group i dont think you understand what the space is about or the incentives at play
373794,does anyone know a good site for bulk airdropping nfts to many addresses the nfts already exist
373795,one that came up
373796,i guess the tornado team should go focus on paper cashyo wtf
373797,disperseapp multisenderapp
373800,disperse doesnt seem to work multisender has an nft option but just realised its mad annoying like this anyway thanks in any case
373801,sounds like hes being as hyperbolic as sambacha but in reverse saying people who want to write code that respects regulation should go back to web2 is just as ridiculous as tornado cash focusing on fiat
373802,as far as i can tell their interface is much nicer and more convenient than that of the service above
373803,ivan pls my brain its smooth already cant take much more
373804,cointoolapp maybe but dyor
373805,lets all hug chill try to reasonably legally stand out grand support and stay safu now lets go touch grass and no i dont mean your bushwhack log off sers 3
373806,you can check contracts that are used for multisending
373807,nan
373808,
373809,before we touch grass tho here is more memezes
373810,is there any resource i can read up on possible replay attacks with the hardfork cant seem to find it in the chat
373811,boys whats your opinion on amount staked on an network when does the total amount staked by all participants increase when does it decrease do price and volume affect the amount staked in your opinion
373812,the incentives at play is not some magical nuanced concept its obviously making money the vcs funding them that virtuesignal about decentralization with one hand and fund them with the other know theres money to be made by anyone that successfully leashes cryptoif it wasnt just some dude in some telegram group calling it out for what it is wed be better off but alas the norm is to pretend theres some nuance to be understood and act surprised when its time to pay the piper
373813,also looking for a good one
373814,looking at dramas like this we rly deserve every scam and hack and regulation we get on crypto sending stuff back is simple manners and shouldnt be a matter of discussion rly especially that lengthy and personally offensive on both sides edit sending stuff back to the rightful owner
373818,i would just send the tokens to the burn address without all the back and forth lol wtf is dog and snoop anyways
373819,
373820,sad
373823,damn they had posted a roadmap update few days ago no
373824,well practically without tornado and without pow mining all defi will be kycd
373825,ethxmr atomic swaps and cash transactions will be 001 or so
373826,do you think they are just disbanding their official team but continuing anon the timing of all this seems really odd
373827,it said in the announcement they couldnt complete funding round
373828,yeah for more details check the other link and specifically
373829,whats vxtwitter btw
373830,baserow smartsheet coda zenkit monday zoho creator rows directus grsit dbeaver has anyone used any of these for databases if so which one and would you recommend it or no
373831,a way to link to twitter without worrying about the previews on telegram having a stroke same as twxttercom but vxtwittercom shows the text in addition to any imagesvideos in the tweet
373832,none of those why use them as databases can you elaborate a little more what you intend to store if its like project management stuff thats what those are for
373833,sorry more so a simple clean ui which can display a clean data like airtable for example not sure if i can send images so heres a link
373834,monday might be the closest to airtable same with trello same with baserow
373835,regarding data or project management im looking for databases
373836,i use dbeaver regularly w psql behind it tho
373837,the term ur looking for is cms
373838,data but databases arent really supposed to be exposed to frontend like this
373839,these are content management platforms
373840,yea i did a shit job of describing what i was looking for what would you guys recommend for content management platforms preferably free
373841,posterboard inkjet printer string
373842,these are great
373843,sorry not trying to flame just not really the use case for a database in a traditional sense most platforms are wrappers on top of a database to allow you to interact with data and present it
373844,most you will have to pay for
373845,still costs to host a database
373846,its not flaming you guys are just showing me the proper terminology its fine i saw it say databases on airtable so i just went with that
373847,yea i think ill probably just end up using notiongoogle sheets then switch over to airtable
373848,yea gotcha i mean really depends what youre trying to store but if you want to use most of the features you will need to pay some fee
373849,its probably not just paranoia and actually feds sliding into folks dms saying u up
373850,depending on how many records youre trying to work with notion is kind of crap and has pretty bad performance with only a few hundred rows google sheets is probably much better to start with
373851,also notion kind of relying on 3rd parties like zapieretc for any automated things
373852,essentially im trying to create data for vc funding rounds and also create profiles for each vc and each project
373853,so im going to do it all manual at first and eventually write a script to automate the updates and manual review before publishing
373854,this seems more like youd need a crm then
373855,how do they define bad address ones that havent backed up their identity or do they define set of bad acitivities
373856,the only problem i have is making separate profiles for each fund project on google sheets would be shit but on notion not too bad
373857,or erp or whatever they call it
373858,im not too sure on the exact terminology thats the only problem haha i just know i need to be able to build a clean chart preferably with colours for categories create profiles
373859,look at the pictures on their website this looks pretty ideal tbh also grist labsthe only problem is once scaling itll cost me i just realized if i self host it wont
373860,in that case if youre not working with too many records notion is clunky but can handle the basics of that scaling is going to cost you on all the things though if you go with any managed service
373861,since baserow has option for selfhosting why not just do that
373862,would also look into nocodb for airtablelike experience not that polished uiwise but seemed good featurewise
373863,i just noticed now haha so probably will going to go over my other options first as well just wanted to see what other people in here use are familiar with
373868,in the context of that tweet whatever trm says is bad ie tornado users
373869,im looking up to see how they define it but they only really talk about tornado cash if they continue to define bad addresses and bad activities case by case that prob sets up dangerous precedent for how this is controlled idk how clearheaded the us government is on these matters or whether they will continue to be in the futureid be much more comfortable with regulators clearly defining what bad means or at least providing set of principles where people can play games over like they do in tradfi
373870,clearly definingheh you underestimate the value of ambiguity
373871,im not im pointing out how terribly it could go for people who dont stay on top of it especially if you dont influence how that ambiguity plays outbasically implicitly asking whats being done there
373872,how terribly it could go for people who dont stay on top of it thats the point fear is a wonderful tool
373873,things are left vague and open ended for a reason but even when things are defined weve already seen in the last few weeks that the sec was more than happy to reach for anything and determine that it fit the definition
373874,if youre operating under the assumption that the government is currently some well orchestrated entity where everything is clear cut and following the rules means youll be okay you are sadly mistaken
373875,good fin
373876,yes vcs make money they also fund innovationthe market decides if they need this product or not seems clear to me products like these have a need and are therefore valuable to humanity if they dont have a market of people willing to pay then the vc doesnt make moneythe real issue in web3 is all the shitty tokens weve been funding as a community for years which clearly dont have a need
373877,ah yes its the enlightened vcs and their startups that have seen the light and know true innovation with their fintech knockoffs
373878,innovative web3 same as web2 but now with a completely dubious blockchain component but thats okay because humanity and someone wants to talk about not knowing what this space is about
373879,easy to speak about innovation when you didnt innovate anything in the space
373880,now truly fin
373908,i think youre completely midunderstanding my points i know im not exactly in the consensus group here so maybe my point didnt get acrossill try to make it very explicit below attach citations where needed2 things 1 if regulators remain vague then projects are putting themselves in a pretty risky position if you dont have the ability to influence what theyll do or not have good intelligence on what direction theyll go you either have to influence where the short end of the stick will go to or know where its going to avoid it this is deduceable from just critical thinking so no citations needed if you dont buy the logic ask someone who works works at an sro managing regulatory relations to see if they can corroborate2 definitions and principles are good places to iterate on as a side note they dont have to originate from regulators they just need to be adopted by regulatorsthere are plenty of channels where the industry can influence this iterative process ie if you are an sro you can appeal through the ogc 1if you dont like something the regulators are doing then you can file a lawsuit 23 you also may choose to flock towards a rival regulators a la lummisgillibrand bill chamber of digital commerce and cftc chamber of digital commerce membership btw 41 1st paragraph from assists in preparing commission opinions 2 3 4
373909,vcs fund projects with one hand and fund kyc startups with another one massively diluting the value proposition with their shitty advice they dont give a shit about decentralization never look at what vcpoisoned projects say look at their actionsthe excess profits from double dipping in both equity and dumping on retail go to bribe the regulators so they can become the new incumbents the regulatory moat the are building behind closed doors would never allow a hobbyist dev to participatethe exact same play has unfolded so many times before with gambling and social media for example
373910,im just really concerned that all the amazing innovations in the defi world wouldnt see the light of the day an sro employee really passionate about defi
373911,my brains r rotting so hard now despite all your words making sense all of them really very much appreciate
373912,while i actually think this is an interesting topic and appreciate all the takes even those i disagree with it might be time to hand out some unbiased mutes but i dont recommend
373913,the following might not be fair but we are not going anywhere right now with these chatslobbying is important privacy is important but its a shitty idea to do these things in an open chat with nonlawyers it doesnt work its just flood law isnt something that you can know a bit of the same way a semiassed surgeon is gonna do a shit job so whats the best way you pick but i hope i guess we is the consensus now some smart teams and good lawyers get together privately and push for the right agenda not can worms agenda full respect to them and good lucksharing lex gab3 jake blockchainassn coincenter marc of dydx other experineced counsel opinions is fine but not debating them now lets cast the spelll e g a l b e g o n e
373916,pinning this here for 12 hours
373917,this is now a permament rule and again not ghosting the important issues as everyone can share good materials but the garbage convos have to stop
373922,does anyone know of a cosmos delegation service as opposed to using the cli
373926,do you want to delegate or start a validator
373927,i want to better understand how an online delegationasaservice system could work if there is already one available
373928,because i am going to build one but its easier if theres some code to look at ahead of time
373929,hm you can check im assuming thats what you are looking for im sure you already know keplr but that is more of a wallet so is cosmostation
373930,its entirely possible the wallet code could answer my question too still very early on my cosmos journey so thanks for the link and names
373932,yep this citadel code is part of what i was looking for awesome love this group
373933,looks like the acala hack wasnt even intentional
373934,nan
373937,
373938,
373939,hey guys im genuinely looking for discussion around some critical issues that i see arise from recent news
373940,plausible deniability likely my man realized he couldnt cash out and would lose his original funds so came up with the story the critical part is the and so on several times
373941,
373944,does anyone know of a library or api where you can detect all the tokens a wallet has
373945,moralis
373947,dont look like it from the docs
373948,look at bitquery or ethplorer
373950,notion is the king
373952,its for management not data anal true
373954,you can scan the wallet address on all possible networks
373955,the company in question was dynamicxyz theres no retail no token theyre auth0 for web3vcs are human beings too and have funded a large part of what happens in the space there are good and bad vcs if youre fundraising pick the good ones who arent there to dump and tbh if youre doing a token anyway you probably dont care
373956,in reference to this feels like convo may have been derailed at some point
373957,its more the issue that vcs are incentivized to not care about the philosophical aspects of the investment along with the fact that being rich theyre often not the ones with skin in the game
373958,that combination imo should always be treated with extra caution even if the vc themselves is rather nice
373960,
373961,your data analysis is incorrect
373962,we dont do ofac filtering and are doing block construction
373963,
373964,is this proposal following the temp check consensus check and distributing the funds to uniswap governance rather than token holders i cant tell in the code
373965,the consensus check parameters as written on the gov forum
373966,who is we
373968,etherscan api has it for erc20 and erc721 pro endpoint
373969,
373970,how much does an audit from one of the top firms typically run at
373971,chulie0 all the way from 75k to 300k
373972,thankyou
373974,more like 400k if not 500k we know bean paid 350k and even that was incomplete
373975,depending on the source code size and no the number you quoted is literally for tob maybe at the peak time
373976,yeah def not the norm
373977,we just went w consensys sigma prime chainsecurity and again no they are not above 300k at all and gearbox code base is by far not small large enough
373978,matthias egli chainsecurity
373979,depends on line of code and number of auditors ie engineer timeapprox 2050line of code can be a rough benchmark
373980,great ser as well absolutely
373981,perhaps this was within the last 3 months
373982,not perhaps i am giving you literal quotes after knowing what others pay too no need to speculate _
373983,maybe we need like an audit transparency google sheet like the one about compensation transparency that was floating about it would have lines of code cost time etc
373984,shouldnt be hard to make would you do this for example or are things always too fluid to say something too definite cc matthiasegli ddoz9
373985,
373986,not sure what you mean this is what im referring to and yes i am literally referring to tob as the topend
373987,yeh could do doesnt have to that specific it would be more like a temperature check i think calchulus had something similar i would appreciate it if you shared the link good sir
373988,oo
373989,yeah i think i need to find the old link
373990,actually i would like to shill defisafety
373991,
373992,i use this quite a bit you guys can reference impossibles
373993,impossible has 94 coverage from defisafetys framework
373994,still some things we can improve
373995,love the teams work but its scope is a lot wider and looks at the entire operational security practices of a dapp protocol i think we need things more auditor specific
373996,is there any insurance that still works i personally never used it end of the day cause never made sense but is it really done for now
373997,is telegram premium gud
373998,i was bribed by it i dont know what it actually does lobster premium nft is surely better
374000,i dont think it is
374001,thx
374002,trail of bits is over priced and anyways they shouldnt be supported too long the crypto community has supported these sort of companies that also receive government contracts and like to shit on web3 while still charging ridiculous prices trail of bits has a record of phoning it in anyway lest you forget the hegic audit they did
374004,dapporg would be 0
374007,for unslashed the issue for the spartan bucket has more to do with the willingness of the capital suppliers to take more risk right now for other buckets there might be more risk appetite including ones put together by projects themselves
374008,check spearbit or yacademy no reason for such high pricing if your booking in advance 23 months
374009,overall the market seems a bit riskoff right now with tvls going down accross the board
374010,well its fluid in the sense that lines of code are not the only parameter we used to estimate the effort needed to produce a meaningful audit report loc is a really basic rule of thumb here usually defi projects are much more complex than nft projects and it does not necessarily reflected in the number of lines
374011,am i the only one who cant get into binance
374014,
374015,the worst opsec advice ever dont do it
374016,did you get rugged by family ser
374017,no its not even about family rugging its about nontech people fucking up and just losing the keys
374018,if you can get 5 people that dont know each other that setup could be quite good imo
374019,imagine getting anything signed
374020,its not a 55 ms its a 25 or 35
374021,25 is an insta rug lets be honest
374022,for a reasonably hot wallet thats still a massive pain in the butt
374023,it might be a good idea to give family members encrypted copies of the priv key they cant access
374024,whyif the people dont know each other they cant collude
374025,this is more for losing access rather than getting hacked tbf
374026,why not
374027,bro do you know 5 people who dont know each other and yet would trust to hold your entire wealth
374028,literally only people you could trust with this are your parents and grandparents and even then not always
374029,theory is easier than practice yes
374030,people dont really need to know each other to come to an agreement on how to redistribute your money worst case you lose your money
374031,thats a pretty bad case lmao
374032,yes depends on how many funds you gotwould only trust parents grandparents but ehm they are not that tech savvy
374033,you cant collude if you dont know with whom
374034,you need some way to communicate though i dont need to know who you are physically to get stuff done
374035,giving encrypted priv keys is the best of both worlds imho you could set up a self multi sig where you have idk phone ledger as threshold signers and then distribute 3 encrypted copies of the other multisig parties
374036,shag a ledger into the ground at the back of your house why not i mean 2 houses so 2 backyards of course
374037,you communicate with the other 4 they dont communicate between them
374038,which jurisdictions do you guys think has the most accomodating regulatory frameworks for crypto companiestoken issuers currently
374039,the very first thing you approve exposes the signing parties worse even its all open before that even worse you have no idea if we already know each other in some way if your money on the line is enough or you hit the jackpot and made a desperate enough person a signer its only a matter of time before contact is made and thanks to our government friends we all know that privacy is only for criminals so the relevant data is public
374040,it exposes the signing addresses not parties to each otheractually with the various communication options these days yeah collusion cant be prevented you are right
374041,anyone has an explanation why so many hacks happen during bear market is there a rationale behind that or simply coincidence
374042,there are always many hacks happening are you suggesting we are experiencing more now than during the bull market
374043,im afraid yes if we look at the rate of hack stories making the headlines in this bear we can say its happening in every week if not daily
374044,no supergainz to farm haxxor are bored and go on offensive
374045,without actual data this is hard to discuss i do not feel like we are experiencing more hacks now but maybe they stand out more since there is less stuff going on in general and certainly less rugs if you make it dependent on headlines
374047,theres data tldr less hax compared to last year but more damage done averaging 26 milhack for 2022 which explains the headlines uwu
374048,nan
374049,
374050,2845b if one counts 400m cel at nonzero
374064,piss off w ur philosophy frens from here
374065,what is the actual topic of convo then
374067,there was none that was the issue u and sam were gaslighting each other and others piled in all good but fin
374069,
374070,considered all above is correct all short squeezers who still holding their cel will soon be very rekt
374071,itll be a message about tornado cash im trying not to repeat stuff in circles and i also used ctrlf sry if this topic was already discussedwe all know what happened sanctions usdc freeze blocking from defiprotocols etc in the same time 1 some of sanctionsrelated actions were made by pseudodecentralized entitiesdaos aave dydx pocket 2 even though technically this actions were made by centralized entities standing behind protocols imo its a very poor message to all defi users 3 in spite of the ability of centralized entities to block defiprotocols frontend they cant block smartcontracts andor the daos ability to make governance decisions 4 hence daos including aave dydx etc can make decisions with reverse logic compared to centr ent behind them and decide to support tornado cash and freedom of code in general with the resources that are technically available to themweve already seen how cryptousers can join forces to support what they believe in freerossdao pooltogether constitutiondao daos can make decisions about their treasury assets especially when itll benefit dao eg communitydevelopersecosystem grantsthe question is are there any obstacles for lets say aave community to propose xmln spending to support tornado in this situation lawyers mediacoverage and other expenditures xmln spending for lobbyist services in usa to prevent this kind of shit happens in future may be there are some examples of similar discussions in other daos forums and more general question are there any examples of daos trying to lobby their interests irl pooltogether did sth similar but afak they only tried to find money for lawyers
374073,this is wishful thinking if any project publicly through dao votes to pay for legal fees of the company being attacked by the us youll be hit in collatoralgo home fed
374074,dont mean to be a buzz kill here but for this part cryptousers can join forces to support what they believe in freerossdao pooltogether constitutiondao ross is still in prison the constitution bid lost pool together is still being sued by kent
374075,quite a few are afraid to anger the cyborg i would assume and without getting into legal fugazi there is already some personal help happening from devslawyers smaller scale on a personal level to alex afaik if more will be i am sure we will hear of that too but so far for this defi case it seems like the incumbents larger ones are of the opinion to actually play into the narc narrative as banteg says it while the smaller ones likely dont have the resources to go a separate way unless they have big metal balls that is marc of dydx is a fan of super tight regulation they are us offchain engine so they are pretty freaking centralized so its logical aave seems to not follow the same playbook per se but doesnt seem yet to want to fight it off while team members openly say just use a diff deployment idk uniswap is the largest and likely sees largest scrutiny so idk if they would wanna fight too question is who will be on the nonnarc side that nonus projects can follow cc banteg lex just shouting doesnt make devs feel comfy l e g a l b e g o n e
374076,my point was that community can join forces financially primarily not kill the leviathan
374077,well there is currently no initiative but if there is a post would be ok about it so far seems like people chat privately fin
374079,i know its kind of a general question but what useful research can be done on stable coins besides if its a scam backing market cap market dominance sorry admins if not allowed
374080,stablecoinswtf has some interesting information on this topic also defillamas stablecoin dashboards not sure if this helps with your question but thought i would provide in case helpful
374083,thanks ill check it out i found this piece and im also reading this right nowthought i would share if anyone else is interested
374084,you can also find it by searching stablecoins are digital currencies that peg their value to an external reference typically the us dollar usd stablecoins play a key role in digital markets and their growth could spur innovations in the broader economy if you dont want to open the pdf
374086,wat and risk a rico conspiracy charge
374087,i am nor have i ever been associated with any sort of gangs
374088,go read the papers on arxiv like instability in a stablecoin etc
374094,

374102,breaking softbank now rebranded to a16z
374105,does this have anything to do with blockchain
374106,also wasnt adam doing carbon credits or something
374107,yes thats it
374108,ah he paused it
374109,seems like they pivoted
374110,from flow carbon to flow
374111,no the carbon credit issues shalted any carbon credit token klima goddess
374114,after taking 70m someones gotta be making money vcs can quickly increase their equity value via a bigger round later to satisfy their lps iirc softbanks masayoshi son will literally shout at founders for not taking more money in a round even when they have needuse for it
374123,a16z lead 15 b round for do know new stable coin project sources
374125,enough jokes
374132,based on the current context make sense to delay eth merge
374133,anyone for a new toy
374134,curved 55 gaming monitor no tnx
374135,what context is that
374136,along with the price 3500 its huge
374137,yea 49 inch itself is overkill not a pleasure toworknwith
374138,40 inch 5k2k is where it peaks
374139,tc most of validators big entities us pbs discussion still early days mev boost potential attack surface
374140,mevboost already implemented in clients tho
374141,in some of them
374142,this is concerning since flashbots demonstrated today they disregard the existance of any countries but the us some examples
374144,not some mostteku prysm lighthouse
374145,its not implemented in them those clients can work with mev boost but obviously dont require it
374146,correct they have the support for pulling blocks to validate from mev boost api
374147,i dont feel confident about censorship resistance
374150,
374152,hey frens is there a tool where i can put eth addresses i want and people can sign with their wallets if they want to join looks like collablend is only for nfts havent seen that i can just put eth address and have those for whitelist
374153,hey does anyone know how much gas the uniswap lib sqrt function consumes vs a checked multiplication
374154,yes guildxyz has that functionality an example for an allow list by lens protocol
374155,and you can do much more
374156,citizen jack wrote tests
374157,about 4000 vs 200 in case anyones wondering
374158,which one is 4k
374159,sqrt
374160,makes sense its more expensive but i didnt realize just how much damn
374161,that is surprising id have thought all the oddities in there was them trying to squeeze out all optimizations possible
374162,
374163,is there a delay when uploading an image to ipfs
374164,i mean not much once uploaded and pinned it should be findable but may take a while for your search to find the right node such that youre not getting cache misses
374165,additional delays may exist if youre using a 3rd party pinning service
374166,used infura and its uploaded but i cant find it
374167,i can barely hello world so i prolly fuked up somewhere
374169,you should try arweave too
374170,not pumping bags but ipfs while great and critical infrastructure isnt that great
374171,at the very least being mirrored ipfsarweave is optimal
374183,lobs coding question is there any way to dynamically import the storage layout of a contract you are about to delegatecall and if possible that it only exists in execution main reason is to use one contract as proxy for two other contracts
374195,
374204,infura last week killed the public gateway and pinning do you have a key etc
374205,freealex public group
374206,fyi this is not the relay this is a glorified service proxy for providing a gateway for wallets to use this rpc service checks to ensure that the originator is infact a wallet user agent it still has to communicate with the actual relay which the mainnet one is closed source currently
374207,i say ensure because you can always fake it so obviously ymmv checks for known wallet extension identifiers iirc
374208,infact if mev boost sidecar fails to produce a block the recommendation is actually to have a fallback block construction process in that event
374209,correct i think most teams are also working on parallel construction ie prepare a vanilla block just in case
374210,whats missing and ideal would be making it easy to compare those vanilla block to the block received from the relay client side
374211,how do we even define an acceptable level of censorship at the tx level
374212,ie if the block doesnt contain censored txs and isnt full the vanilla block may have higher value
374213,but this isnt currently feasible iirc because mevboosr talks to cl and not el
374214,this is the real design flaw of sidecar approach vs middleware approach mev boost is basically like a step father all the responsibility none of the authority
374215,cucked from day 0
374216,that or its bc of beacon node api freeze preventing necessary changes i forget
374217,did anyone make an instruction set for non tech elites to still use tornado cash alternative frontends explanation of that tornado plus thing list of rpc endpoints and relayers still not rekt etc
374218,i outlined my thoughts on the fee switch here
374219,so am i understanding correctly that he wants to force them to hard fork to get his alleged bitcorns back
374220,the company tulip trading ltd is seeking to bring proceedings in the high court that would require 16 bitcoin developers based around the world to write software patches to enable the recovery of assets worth more than 1bn stolen in a 2020 hack on wrights computers
374221,im gonna go out on a limb and say that wright did not have 1b of assets ever hack or not
374222,nan
374223,my point is simply that i dont think we are ready so much reasoning about how to be more resistant is happening rn eg blind proposals encrypted txs etclets see
374224,and there has been no statement from any of the centralized staking entities if they would censor at the protocol level or prefer to exit their validators if it came to that
374225,what do you want them to say
374226,there are no repercussions for saying one thing and doing another when push comes to shove just feign being a victim et voila
374227,1 on this we should stand for freedom together freealex opensourceisnotacrimeif you want to help please join us
374228,i want them to answer with an a or a b sure they can say one and then do the other then they can be held accountable by the community and by their usersnot saying anything though is still saying something and thats a
374229,says bpush comes to shove does a niche group in the community y u lie response lets have a nuanced discussion rest of the community what did you expect them to do they have to comply because reasons dont attack them too much insert other excuses
374230,see jeremy whatshisname where that played out with usdc
374231,i know what you are alluding to i am not that thick
374232,but still i would like to at least have a statement on this silence is also a statement
374233,yeah itd be nice if they admitted this right out the gate so you know who youre dealing with
374234,silence isnt really a statement either generally youre supposed to avoid making claims about the future unless you can actually intend to deliver on it
374235,but thats getting into legal discussion not kingdom etc
374236,silence isnt really a statement eitherto be clear i am not getting into legalese here these guys make statements every other day we are commited to insert big words here ec
374237,fwiw i dont disagree with trying to coax an answer out of them makes for a good reference when it eventually happens
374238,were committed to xyz is drastically different than saying when x happens we plan to do y especially with a lot of unknowns and things up in the air if they say something now and dont deliver on it they can get in trouble either way
374239,most people genuinely dont know and the bigger entities are kind of in the same boat in this regard everyone else is just waiting to see what everyone else is doing at this point
374240,3730 does ethereum get captured by the state
374242,
374243,i know i am quite doxxed in my jurisdiction if at any point the government here asks me to use a specific staking client i will not comply i will simply exit my validator i know my size is not size and all that but if this field devolves to a permissioned centralized stoppable finance then it has failed and size does not matter
374244,this doesnt actually do what you think it does though
374245,if you do this and other entities accept to censor you end up with a more censored network
374246,come on isidoros ofc i know it
374247,you know me well
374248,i would just exit the field if it devolved to this
374249,how does that help anyone
374250,sounds even worse then making ethereum depend on a proprietary piece of infra
374251,its not a necessary piece of mev boost
374252,its just an alternative rpc like infura
374253,does anyone know of a tool or website to see the addresses that have delegated voting power to another i know sites like tally allow you to see how many addresses but trying to get the actual wallet addresses
374254,this has been on my mind as well i had a lot more to type but theres not much else to say on it
374255,sorry for this being so off topic but theres never a good time and figured this is the best place to ask
374256,youre scaring me although i feel like snapshot would have some kind of record for this
374257,it helps me by no longer dedicating my most precious resource my time in something i no longer believe init may also help few others realize when something is just finished to not waste their most precious resourcemind you i am not saying we are there but we are heading straight to that
374258,ser loves your tweet threads didnt know u r here
374259,just trying to do some consolidating between addresses
374260,so bullish for bsc cz saw the future and got there first jk but might such concerns hold up the merge
374261,found a site for anyone else looking deffoxyz
374262,ooook sure mr sec govt lawyer who is consolidating anonymous votes on a beautiful monday afternoon
374263,nan
374264,these are all terrible ideas
374265,these solutions are binaryeither everyone uses it or no one does
374266,holy fuck does no one listen to me
374267,bruh youre taking us right there lol
374268,there is some serious fetishized end of times attitudes going around
374269,if you want an alternative dm me i will share with you
374270,this repo is completely optional and there is no need for it anyway
374271,listen heres the deal we wont censor any ofac transactions so long as the fee is greater than the fine
374272,you are in a chat with 20k people we are listening
374273,who is we here
374274,my pronouns are they them
374275,i dont listen to you
374276,securerpccom
374277,i dont either tbf
374278,is this mev protected by default
374279,yes
374280,
374281,chill folks here to discuss not to fight each other
374284,yes you can use manifold_sendbundle to send bundles etc just like flashbots rpc
374285,and in mm
374286,yes
374287,this is what powers sushiswap sushi guard under the hood
374288,if you want a protocol to support this on their frontend lmk
374290,here is the last 7 days worth of tx value only monitored not total flow
374291,nan
374292,i think a few blocks we might be able to make that are high value maybe idk
374293,want to come help me build a monero node
374294,ive collected several researches here and here try checking also
374295,is it possible to change eth2 validator keysrotating validators keys transfer to someone elsei remember technically possible but not yet enabledimplemented
374296,as i said we are not there yet but building something different if we get there will be fun lets see how it all goes
374297,is mev boost attack surface specific to pos if not how related to mergeis tc issue any worse on pos if not how relevant to merge is pbs in by merge time
374298,you could say tc is tangentially related due to stake derivatives and domination by several big players that can be legally pressured
374299,frankly a good reminder that ct twitter fanboys are often over simplistic and focused on ngu ultra sound money narrative but in effect miss dont understand the risks associated with pos
374300,nope it is not possible now i think this was the proposal
374301,does cap means total supply of a token
374302,i dont think this is erc20 standard usually there should be a view function called totalsupply
374304,did any one here uses ionlyflyfirstclasscom they take crypto and buying business class tickets for miles 30 cheaper very convenient surprised they didnt get much attention maybe any one know if there is cons googling it and it looks good also my friend uses it
374305,many have used it for years it works i had one booking previously cancellation due to some shit making me double pay basically but otherwise no issues
374309,godefi that thread was mentioned already and i believe sam banteg and others went through it scroll above
374310,tldr tax minimization has lead to offshore jurisdictions being used for staking entities reduce sanctions compliance risk there is more than just flashbots producing blocks
374311,new normal
374312,thats what happens when you pour all efforts into hype and marketing and minimal effort into researcheventually well have sound solutions but that will take time as people are reckless
374313,the problem was a wrong manual configuration during the creation of a pool regular users received disproportionate rewards after a voting the excess of tokens were burnt and ausd is getting back to the peg
374314,juan already posted the what happened but they were incredibly responsive and seemed to have already passed a resolution through to the community it was actually handled pretty well all things consideredits one thing if something like this happens exploit hack etc but its a completely different story based on how you handle it after the fact
374315,
374317,it could be ozs erc20capped then it would indeed by the max tokens that can be minted
374323,there were no talks about recent cyber fuckgoogle boot airdropthere is a lack of 92_000 airdrop claimersreference
374324,yeah thats true
374325,i am always fond of communities like this where many things can be learnt
374326,most of the things i learned in this space are from communities
374327,accurate i think being in the best community can be life changing
374328,most especially ones that are consistently active
374329,vitalik has 00002 worth vitalik then imagine how much we have
374330,you forgot to multiply by 1e6and actually by 12 again cause of the bonus
374331,ok vitalik has about 5k how much money is that
374338,
374340,username4912 old news bait title ctrlf for 1 week old convos
374343,ethw team released the first code yesterday including the removal of eip1559 and distribute to the miners people found a loophole which will roll back all blocks to before the london fork team released the patch code for the vulnerability this morning link
374344,meaning there will be no way to game the system when the fork happens to maximize your eth since they roll back to before london fork the balances at the time will countam i understanding this right
374345,how do you know they buy it for miles and not from stolen credit cards
374346,you dont just the longtime client list of crypto people successfully using em since 2017
374347,if i understood correctly it wasnt intentional behaviour just a bug when they reverted eip1559
374348,aptos and sui are two promising third generation blockchain projects has anyone compare and contrast their technology and how they market themselves which chain do you think has a better chance to succeed
374349,well use at your own risk i would say
374350,actually curious about this too heard a lot of buzz about aptos recently but it honestly looked extremely shady in many ways would love to know what i missed
374351,still waiting for aptos to release the distribution breakdown of their token and the emission schedule very keen to see how that 350mil they raised is allocated
374352,alex mashinsky took control of celsius trading strategy months before bankruptcy
374353,
374354,links to softbank article for me
374355,lolfor me leads to article re madhinsky
374356,ah if you accept cookies it jumps page
374357,with eth worth 2x the bottom now i wonder if this would have saved celsius is it clear how much they hold and how much theyve had to sell off already
374358,what they hold is detailed here
374359,i thought this day would never come but im finally having to write the geoblocking code for a client to prevent ofac sanctioned country people accessing a web30 service every part of this makes me feel uncomfortable but the reality is the smartcontracts dgaf and its just web front end stuffhas anyone else had to do this yet and if so do you have a good resource on how to implement subregion specific stuff like crimea but not the rest of the ukraine etc in terms of iso codes anyone looking for either a cloudflare or vercel solution do reach out as i can help with the restcant have people going to jail but man this is a sad say
374360,at masq we built a software that uses what we call a dmeshvpn that enable you to access any dapp from anywhere uncensored browsing a user runs the masq node software and their requests for content online are packaged into cores packages of data and these are routed across other users nodes in the networkits in beta phase but im happy to add you any lobster that is interested in testing it
374361,i amwill dm
374362,sounds awesome and i really hope this becomes the norm the ultimately shitty thing is that blunt geofencing or wallet blacklisting isnt going to stop north korean hackers at all it just makes ordinary honest peoples lives harderthing is given the current regime if it means a project can go ahead without us based peeps worrying about jail time when otherwise the project wont get built theres just no choice short sighted legislators have achieved little other scoring political points but now we all have to jump through somewhat pointless hoops
374363,what was the site that lets you bid on all nfts in a collection at once
374367,gemxyz genie aggregatorsyou can also do collection floor offers on looksrare
374370,would love to get reminded of this as well
374371,coinbase to pause eth erc20 deposits withdrawls during merge
374372,makes sense tbh safest route id expect other cexs to follow
374373,interesting to see how bridges will react
374380,coinbase shares drop 7 to session low
374381,i think opeansea has a collection bid now too
374382,not surprisingly
374383,dapps should at least provide a warning window of 2 hours though this is dependent on an accurate approximation of the merge window
374384,basically every site has it now even opensea has collection offers
374385,yep found it on os ty
374387,
374388,hi guys do you know any website where it shows your farming status on metis network
374389,usually im using zapper but no andromeda network there
374390,i think we need to place buy and sell order at the same time
374392,hey ivangbi mate would you plz check your dm
374393,wow what is this place is this an extension to fold
374395,try debank
374398,why did my question get removed about the validations its an honest question trying to understand if i need to run a few validations myself
374399,rich validators decide everything and if usdc usdt choose ethpow then new pos chain is very much under danger are all known and widely discussed topics previously i am subjectively removing redundant questions topics running your own little validators wont change the majority decision which is the true form but it can improve the chains decentralization so if you can ye do it chad
374400,hmm so its pretty much case closed majority rules no matter what way we try and go around this as blackrock friends will eventually run compliant validators so what is the next step forward we should be focused on for decentralization
374401,check convo from here ser
374402,
374403,
374404,hey all do any dao treasury managers here use physical wallets eg ledgertrezor is it possible to use multisigs with hardware devices
374405,for dao funds
374406,yes it is
374407,its always advisable to clone your hardware wallet aswell you know just in case
374408,who are some good dao treasury managers on eth and l2s
374410,so i am trying to wrap my head around what the lens protocol is is it an ens competitor with a centralized indexer that listens for event using lens handle and then provides an api for you to build your app on top of
374411,decentralised twitter dont think its trying to compete with ens but you do have your own handle
374412,the data is stored to arweave
374413,it is a decentralized signon profile kind of thing you can create a lens handle and then use it on all apps that are compatible with the lens protocol mostly for social kind of apps i think can probably do more havent looked into it too muchthe decentralized twitter is only one app building on it i think it was also the first launched by the core team
374414,everytime someone explains lens as decentralised twitter it makes ppl more confused i think not u directly everyone says thatdata being stored on arweave means nothing
374415,what im curious about is how aave plans on integrating it in the future social credit score undercol lending etcrn it seems like a very low level protocol for social graphing with the hopes of the dev community building user facing utility correct me if im wrong
374416,yeah they kinda sidestepped solving the actual problems this decentralized social stuff has by just providing a base layer and letting others build the actual products it doesnt feel like any of those apps are really taking off yet
374417,i dont think designing a protocol and having the community build overlaying products is a bad strategy at all btw the way to go imo
374418,given there are good incentives for contributing devs to do the deed which is what i think is lacking rn
374419,so essentially its a bit like early web attempts at creating a distributed social graph where the data was supposed to be embedded in each page and then you have an rss like protocol that can help you keep tabs on your friends
374420,yeah a decentralized canonical social graph eg if you were the same entity across fbtwittermyspaceytsoundcloud if those were build on top of something like lens again pls correct me if im wrong
374422,why people are doing the sad smiley this just means eth will not live long when you can block people its not better than cefi there is no need then for users to switch from central point of failures which are all faster better looking and with more users
374423,pek ec eae ooac
374424,i think ofac region blocking makes sense and isnt that badeasily bypassed with vpns and whatnot the really crazy thing is this idea that every defi website which probably also means every block explorer has to hire trm to figure which nonsdnlisted addresses might nevertheless be owned by sdns and then block those addresses
374425,can you add jurad0x
374426,dm
374428,
374429,citi amex and paypal all investers in trm
374431,
374432,true innovation coming into crypto
374433,
374434,average lemiscate hottest shit take of the week
374435,and stani defending him is just hilarious tbf
374436,i still think stani has a point tho easier to not comply when you are anon but at the same time without structure trad fi the pie gets only to a certain size i guess not saying that is wrong inherently
374437,and again between having a good point and strictly licking trm boots there are miles llamao
374438,hey guys does anyone know if you can get a snapshot of an eth wallets holdings and usd value for a specific date not just eth but all erc20s it held im thinking nansen but wanna make sure before i sign up
374439,i think stani hasnt read the article so he didnt understand the reaction the article is an stier comedy i give it that in terms of quality its a generic prnewswire press release which is supposed to be a case study it describes how none of their assumptions worked and how customers suffered from their product
374440,but that wasnt the point tho
374441,ye marc is defending trm without a reason or maybe he does have one and stani is defending marc without a reason
374442,marc has done more damage than what he has provided to the space by bringing missinformation pnd schemes into life
374443,this reasoning has been around for a long time and its never panned out one of the early rebuttles against bitcoin was that instantiations wouldnt support it without reversibility so it would never grow big
374444,i have shitty memory but wasnt him the one shitting on yearn when all the war rooms happen
374445,and he has the worst sportsmanship of them all in the space doesnt respect anyone and just cares about its own interests its just retarded
374446,corps and govs move around what they cant control if its proven they truly cant control it
374447,oh yeah right he was the one dont like him either lol i remember now
374448,ye he always has the hottest shit take of the week
374450,header snapshotter is now working just need to hook it up everywhere and add bittorrent client to akula
374451,nan
374452,word in defi france is that he grew too cocky so kinda computes with what you are all saying here
374453,of course i have 0 evidence to show about this in here so please take it as a rumor c
374454,why do you think marc deleted any tweet before 22
374456,im building this the demo is almost ready whats your usecase may i ask
374457,hello fellow lobsters
374458,yo mycelium just deployed mlp on arbitrum lp rewards are live now apr 200 for any humble out there
374459,do you get weth as rewards so far i only see the esmyp rewarded
374460,myc rewards for week 1 once we have trading fees rewards will be weth
374461,week 2 weth
374463,my accountant is retarded and im trying to get a snapshot of my end of financial year holdings to be fair there was like 10000 trades across different chains i ended up using nansen but good on you for building it seems like something really needed in the space one thing nansen doesnt do though is multi chains and you have to search each token individually and pull data that way
374464,
374466,can find it in many placesalso on santiment historical balanceswith a neat visualisation tool showing the balances changes on top of the price over selected time range
374467,guys does anyone know if there is an application or tools to be able to check if two wallets have had a connection and or relationship between them also through the study of the transactions that go through several wallets
374468,any lobsters going to kyiv web3 hackathon september 69th im planning on being there would be great to grab drinks
374469,whats funny is that no one complains about the txs being rejected and censored by ethermine and flashbots right now not related to ofac
374470,by the way which do you think is the onchain analytics with the best user experience preferably the ones that are selfserved and that everyone on the team can use
